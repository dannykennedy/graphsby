This is the last issue of Dream Network Journal in its current form. These are hard words for me to write. I feel hope in the new beginnings symbol of the egg and the many hands. Who knows what the future might hold? In this context, Russ Lockhart recently said: “I now believe it is time for DNJ to ‘go dark’ for 2015 as a necessary state for rebirth if that is in the future. Letting go of DNJ, letting it die, is likely what is necessary for any future rebirth of DNJ.” I say: So Be It. Amen.
