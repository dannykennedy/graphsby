Hi, I’m Kelly Bulkeley, Ph.D., a psychologist of religion specializing in dream research. This website is for anyone who is interested in dreams and wants to learn more about current research on dreams in relation to psychology, religion, evolutionary science, politics, art, and culture.  I also encourage you to visit the Sleep and Dream Database (SDDb), a companion website with a collection of thousands of dream reports and digital tools to study them.

I was not interested in dreams as a child, but as a teenager I experienced a series of recurrent nightmares in which I was chased and attacked by frightening antagonists, including the uber-villain Darth Vader of the “Star Wars” movies.  These nightmares forced their way into my waking awareness and prompted what has become a lifelong fascination.  Where do such strange dreams come from?  What generates their emotional intensity, hyper-realism, and boundless creativity?  What do they tell us about the potentials of the human mind?  These are the questions motivating my work.
