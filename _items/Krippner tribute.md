Both William James and Gardner Murphy reached the height of their profession as psychologists. Both had the prestige and courage to confront the scientific community with what, in James’ time, was known as psychic phenomena and in Murphy’s time as parapsychology. Murphy was also a remarkable teacher and spawned a whole new generation of researchers. Stanley Krippner has followed in the tracks of both James and Murphy. In 1961, I made a critical decision that led to my connection with Stan. I gave up my psychoanalytic practice to accept a full-time position at the Maimonides Medical Center to develop a department of psychiatry there. What was so tempting about the offer was that it held out the possibility of setting up a sleep laboratory to study dream telepathy.
