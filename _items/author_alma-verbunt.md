My acquaintance with dreams dates from a very long time ago. During and after my psychology studies, I studied dreams more deeply. Initially by writing down my dreams and working with them, reading a lot about dreams and later by following a dream course with Hans Korteweg, among others. I also did an intensive Dream Quest with Professor [Henry Reed](../@henryreed), who is known in America as 'The father of modern dreamwork' and learnt from him ways to apply the information that I got from my dreams into my daily life and thus make changes in myself and my environment.

I provide different services to help you interpret your dreams, enquire via my [website](https://www.droomtoko.nl/html/droomconsult.htm).
