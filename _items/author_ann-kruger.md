At the time of her interview in the DNJ, Ann Kruglak (then Ann Klein) was a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in Englewood, Colorado. She worked with dreams personally and professionally for over 15 years. Her intentional dreams guided her to create [Interactive Dreaming](https://web.archive.org/web/20030125195431/http://www.dreamcd.com/), a educational and entertaining multimedia CD that guided people to learn about their dreams, dream intentionally, how to do dreamwork, and keep a journal of their dreams.

After retiring in 2008, she began working with polymer clay, creating a [personal studio](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MysticDreamerArt) with all profits donated to rainforest preservation.
