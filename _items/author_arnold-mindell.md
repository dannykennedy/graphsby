Dr. Arnold Mindell, or Arny, is also in private practice in Portland, Oregon, and teaches with his wife [Amy Mindell](../@amymindell) around the world. He is known for his development of the “Dreambody” and “Process Work” ([process oriented psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process-oriented_psychology)).

He is the author of 23 books in over 35 languages, including _Dreambody_, _The Shaman’s Body_, _Quantum Mind_, _Quantum Mind and Healing_, and _The Deep Democracy of Open Forums_. He is also known in the areas of diversity work and conflict management for his _Sitting in the Fire_ and for his integration of psychology, ecology and physics, for his work on dreams, bodywork, relationships, and for interventions in near death situations. His latest works, _ProcessMind_, A User’s Guide to The Mind of God and Dance of the Ancient One, bring psychology, physics and spiritual traditions closer to one another.
