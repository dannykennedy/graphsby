He is known for his development of the “Dreambody” and “Process Work” ([process oriented psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process-oriented_psychology)).

He is the author of 23 books in over 35 languages, including *Dreambody*, *The Shaman’s Body*, *Quantum Mind*, *Quantum Mind and Healing*, and *The Deep Democracy of Open Forums*. He is also known in the areas of diversity work and conflict management for his *Sitting in the Fire* and for his integration of psychology, ecology and physics, for his work on dreams, bodywork, relationships, and for interventions in near death situations. His latest works, *ProcessMind*, A User’s Guide to The Mind of God and Dance of the Ancient One, bring psychology, physics and spiritual traditions closer to one another.
