I am a Dream worker and a Law of Attraction Life Coach.

I believe in possibilities; in the power of change; and know that every individual has the ability to chart a different path simply by choosing an authentic life based on deliberate choices.

In my work, I use my training to help others open their minds to enhanced perspectives that support these changes, working to overcome limiting beliefs that may keep someone from manifesting the life they desire. I use my expertise in dreamwork to help support that mindset.

I have studied the works of Dr. Wayne Dyer, Caroline Myss, Carl Jung, James Hillman, Neale Donald Walsch, Marion Woodman, Clarissa Pinkola Estés, Martín Prechtel, Gregg Levoy and Jack Canfield; Krishnamurti, Gandhi, Kahlil Gibran, A Course in Miracles, Tara Singh, and so many more. I became a certified DreamTender through DreamTending, a clinical training program created by Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, President of Pacifica Institute in Santa Barbara, CA. I’m a member of The International Association for the Study of Dreams (www.asdreams.org) and spent 9 years as a  review editor for The Dream Network Journal. I completed my Law of Attraction life coaching certification through The Quantum Success Coaching Academy’s Certification Program and also received my certification as a Tarotpy Practitioner through the Institute for Dreams and Tarotpy.  I am also a contributing author of the book, [101 Great Ways to Enhance Your Career](https://www.selfgrowth.com/greatcareerbook.html).

Some of my passions are practicing yoga, meditation, healthy eating and overall fitness.  I love nature and animals and try to spend as much time as possible enjoying both.  I love to read, write, cook and practice random acts of kindness, and I love spending time with loved ones and making new friends.
