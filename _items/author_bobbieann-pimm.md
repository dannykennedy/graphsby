I am a dreamworker and author of Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming: A Personal Journey in Dream Interpretation. My current focus is on teaching others how to interpret and work with their own dreams. I have created several [online courses on dream interpretation](https://theazire.org/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11). I am also available to do workshops and one-on-one consultations via phone or Skype.

My interest in dreams began in 1988, after I left my husband of 13 years. At that time, two dreams kept recurring over and over again; dreams which I had since I was 12. I knew these dreams were trying to tell me something, but didn’t know just what. In 1994, I discovered the book, Our Dreaming Mind, by [Dr. Robert L. Van de Castle](../@bobvandecastle), which helped me understand the process of dreaming. With further reading and research, I began to slowly learn to decipher my dreams.

I have been actively enlightening others online about dreams since 2001, when I created my original Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming website to share my experience of learning to interpret my own dreams. Then, in late September 2008, I connected with Dr. Robert Van de Castle at an online PsiberDreaming Conference put on by the [International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD)](http://asdreams.org/). A few short weeks, several lengthy phone calls and numerous emails later, I left New Jersey and moved to Charlottesville, VA to live and work with him until his passing in January 2014. Working closely with Dr. Van de Castle, we created and taught an online course for Atlantic University, Becoming a Teacher of Dreamwork/Dream Interpretation. We also presented together at several conferences and co-authored an article for Explore! journal, [Dreams As a Multidimensional Expression of PSI](<http://www.explorejournal.com/article/S1550-8307(10)00099-6/abstract>).

I am an active member of the IASD for over 15 years and an elected member of the Board of Directors from 2014-2017. As such, I adhere to their [ethical guidelines in dreamworking](http://www.asdreams.org/ethics-and-confidentiality/) which “supports an approach to dreamwork and dream sharing that respects the dreamer’s dignity and integrity, and which recognizes the dreamer as the decision-maker regarding the significance of the dream.” In other words, only the dreamer knows what their dream means. My goal in life is to help you learn to understand what yours are saying to you.

I believe that our dreams are the key to becoming more aware of who we are, why we are who we are and who we are supposed to be. If you care to join me, I’d like to help you learn to interpret your dreams as I have learned to do.
