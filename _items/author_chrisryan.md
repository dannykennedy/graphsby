Christopher and his work have been featured just about everywhere, including Netflix, HBO, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, NPR, **_The New York Times_**, **_The Times of London_**, **_Playboy_**, **_The Washington Post_**, **_Time_**, **_Newsweek_**, and **_The Atlantic_**. Chris has been a featured speaker at TED, SXSW, The Festival of Dangerous Ideas at the Sydney Opera House, the Einstein Forum in Pottsdam, Germany, and is a frequent guest on The Joe Rogan Experience and many other podcasts. He’s also provided expert testimony in a Canadian constitutional hearing and appeared in dozens of documentary films and television shows.

Even before co-authoring the **_New York Times_** best-seller, _[Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What it Means for Modern Relationships](https://amzn.to/2XSJOTi)_ (translated into 18 languages), with Cacilda Jethá, MD, Chris was on a wild ride. After receiving a BA in English and American literature in 1984 he spent the next two decades traveling around the world, pausing in unexpected places to work at decidedly odd jobs (e.g., gutting salmon in Alaska, teaching English to prostitutes in Bangkok and self-defense to land-reform activists in Mexico, managing commercial real-estate in New York’s Diamond District, helping Spanish physicians translate and publish their research). In his mid-30s, Chris decided to pursue doctoral studies in Psychology at Saybrook Graduate School, in San Francisco, CA, using his dissertation to critique mainstream views of human sexual evolution — providing the core arguments later advanced in Sex at Dawn.

Chris’s latest book, _[Civilized to Death: The Price of Progress](https://amzn.to/2JI8Y1O)_ (Simon & Schuster/Avid Reader Press, 2019), questions whether civilization has actually been a net benefit to our species. He hosts a weekly podcast, _[Tangentially Speaking](https://chrisryanphd.com/category/tangentially-speaking/)_, often recorded from the road, while traveling in his van, Scarlett Jovansson. The podcast features conversations with famous comics, bank robbers, drug smugglers, porn stars, authors, and rattlesnake experts.
