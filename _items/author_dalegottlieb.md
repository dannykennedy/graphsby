Dale Gottlieb was born in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Saturday mornings. Her work is still inspired by the African art collection. The appeal of primitive art continued to influence her work, with her exploration of Visionary and Outsider artists. Her work, like theirs, appears naïve yet deals with complex emotions and issues concerning humanity. Working in different venues and mediums, her individual sense of color and narrative approach are the connective tissue in the three arenas she pursues—books, paintings and rugs. She received her BFA from the School of Art and Design at Alfred University. Her work has been shown internationally and throughout the United States. She has written and/or illustrated twenty-eight books for children and her editorial illustration has been published in various periodicals, newspapers and books including The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, Sports Illustrated, Esquire, Ms. And others. She currently lives in Bellingham, WA.

Dale Gottlieb was the Dream Network Bulletin's illustrator from 1983-85.
