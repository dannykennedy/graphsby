I'm a programmer, artist and long time dreamer. I started a dream journal at age 11 and haven't ever thought to stop. I studied Arts and Fine Arts at the University of Sydney, and worked and volunteered a few years in the Northern Territory, mostly buying and documenting work for <a href="https://injalak.com/" target="_blank">Injalak Arts</a>. I've also worked as a copywriter and blog editor for <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>. 

Somehow I discovered an interest in programming, and am now a developer based in Sydney, making sites such as this fabulous one in my spare time! Currently working with [Inoshi](../@inoshi) and [Roberta Ossana](../@robertaossana) to bring back the Dream Network.
