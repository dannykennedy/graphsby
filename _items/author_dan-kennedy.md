I'm a programmer, artist and long time dreamer. I started a dream journal at age 11 and haven't ever thought to stop. I studied Arts and Fine Arts in Sydney, and worked in the arts for a few  years, including a stint at <a href="https://injalak.com/" target="_blank">Injalak Arts</a> in the Northern Territory (I'm still helping with a <a href="https://www.njamed.com/" target="_blank">dictionary of the Kunwinjku language</a>). 

I discovered an interest in programming, and am now a developer based in Sydney, making many sites such as this fabulous one in my spare time! Currently working with [Inoshi](../@inoshi) and [Roberta Ossana](../@robertaossana) to bring back the Dream Network.
