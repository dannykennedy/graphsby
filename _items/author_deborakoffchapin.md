On my last day in art school in 1974, I had a creative awakening. In a moment of playful exploration, I moved my fingertips on a paper towel instead of wiping the inked plate. Lifting the towel, I saw childlike scrawls on the underside, created by the pressure of my touch. I laughed ecstatically with this discovery! This was a precious gift; a direct mode of expression that fulfilled my longing for a more natural way to draw. I sensed it was emerging for more than my own personal use. With this realization came responsibility. Somehow, I would share this process with the world.
