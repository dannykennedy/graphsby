[Leadership Institute of Seattle](https://lios.org/our-heritage#3f2c9ee8-69de-44d0-a9a9-ebfa507d1949)

I was trained as a facilitator in dream psychology and was running adult-learning dream study groups in Seattle, and then through the University of Washington. I was also a tennis player and tennis teacher, when one of my students told me about the LIOS program. I joined the LIOS program to add to my skill set. At this point, I didn’t know much about Applied Behavioral Science degree, yet my experience in adult learning and the helping professions was a natural fit for leadership and organizational development. I took to the program like a fish to water. The program was so well done. I admired the skills of the faculty and the dynamism of the program. All the professors were high quality.

Within the next year and a half or two after graduating the program, I learned that one of my predecessors was hired by AT&T Bell Labs. Through my LIOS networking I got my first OD position at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Management Development and Training. Later I joined a network of practitioners, as a junior laboratory facilitator, and continued to work in corporate settings.

Ron Short and his LIOS peers were embedded in the National and International OD network. The first time I went to a session, Ron Short presented. I attended as a young consultant which led to my exposure in this community of practitioners. I was invited into the community and was able to eventually be a presenter in this network. Going from a participant to a presenter was a significant stepping stone in my career.

I consistently drew on the LIOS core models and skills throughout the decades. With leadership and organizational skills, a network, and great opportunities, I was able to establish a practice of delivering management and executive training, one on one coaching, and a specialty as a facilitator/designer for board of directors’ retreat learning experiences.

LIOS helped me assess and address organizations' leadership and system’s needs. I was able to see and assess the system and help leaders and organizations grow at their learning edges.

LIOS was remarkable: the skill building, the tools, and the professors. It was unquestionably and wonderfully foundational for the success of my 45 years as an international and national OD and leadership consulting career.

Thank you LIOS for much success and career fulfillment.
