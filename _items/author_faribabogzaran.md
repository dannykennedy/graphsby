Fariba Bogzaran, PhD 1994, is artist/scientist, and founded the Dream Studies program at John F. Kennedy University in Berkeley, California, where she taught as an associate professor for 25 years. She was part of the team of researchers with [Stephen LaBerge](../@stephenlaberge) at Stanford Sleep Laboratory (1986-1989) and conducted the first quantitative research on lucid dream incubation and spiritual experiences. She writes essays and chapters on this topic and is the co-author of two major academic books: Extraordinary Dreams (2002) with [Stanley Krippner](../@stanleykrippner) and Integral Dreaming (2012) with Daniel Deslauriers, both published by SUNY Press. She teaches lucid dreaming at CIIS and gives lectures internationally.

Based on her art-based research, _Images of the Lucid Mind_ (1996), she co-founded Lucid Art Foundation (1998) with the surrealist painter Gordon Onslow Ford. She has published numerous essays connecting art and consciousness in major international museums and galleries including: _Through the Light: An Exploration into Consciousness_ (1997); _Surrealism Dreams on Canvas_ (2007); _Landscape of Consciousness_ (2008); _Remedios Varo: Dreams of Alchemy in Five Keys to the Secret World of Remedios Varo_ (2008); _Matta: Psychological Morphology_ (2011), and her award-winning book Gordon Onslow Ford: _A Man on a Green Island_ (2019) [www.lucidart.org/publications](http://www.lucidart.org/publications).

Among many of her own art exhibitions, there are two major publications: _The Third Script: Lucidity of Light_ (2008), Institute of Noetic Sciences and _Lucidity: A Retrospective_ (2013), Meridian Gallery in San Francisco.

Currently Fariba spends time in her studio writing and creating artworks and is active in earth's preservation.
