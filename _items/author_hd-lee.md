I love to learn, teach, coach, relate and create. My life has guided me to experience a diversity of work and cultures. My work is in life coaching, and I specifically seek to work with clients who are dealing with the challenges of change Life inevitably wants to bring us. My calling is in working with groups of all ages within the context education for the express purpose of personal and transpersonal development.
