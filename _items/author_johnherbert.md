[John Herbert](https://www.mtexpress.com/obituaries/john-warne-herbert/article_d9979098-cc09-11e8-a34d-afe2af7e608a.html) (1923-2018) was an aviator, entrepreneur and dream researcher from [Ketchum, Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchum,_Idaho). An MIT graduate and a U.S. Marine Corps Reserve veteran of World War II, Herbert later pursued his passion for psychology, earning a master's degree from San Francisco State University and a PhD focused on dream imagery at 77, making him the oldest person to achieve this feat at the Saybrook Institute. His contributions to the field included creating the internet's first system for working with dreams and a personal collection of over 10,000 recorded dreams.

Herbert's 65-year aviation career was marked by publishing aviation safety magazines, developing safety standards, and flying with Pan Am. He managed various businesses, including an aviation services company and ventures in sound systems and sea urchin harvesting. He believed in the continuity of the soul and the timely nature of life events.
