Linda Mastrangelo, MA, LMFT is an author, educator, artist and psychotherapist with a private practice in the San Francisco Bay area specializing in bereavement and dreamwork. Being a prolific dreamer since childhood, she discovered the remarkable potential of dreams as “good medicine” and developed techniques that have empowered people to make more mindful changes in their lives and communities. Because dreams can go right to the core of issues, Linda uses a gentle approach while encouraging her clients to explore at their own pace while accessing their own wisdom.

With many years of training, facilitations, consultations and award winning research on using dreams as a therapeutic model, she has presented this work internationally including; the [International Association for the Study of Dreams](https://www.asdreams.org/), California Association for Marriage and Family Therapists, Institute for Dream Studies, Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History, Hospice of the Valley, and The Dream Institute of Northern California. Her most recent labor of love happened on April 12 of 2019, the IASD regional event the [“Festival of Dreams”](https://festivalofdreams.net/) with cohost Katherine Bell and an incredible team of volunteers. The event was held in a dreamy venue in the hub of downtown at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History with almost 100 attendees and 30 presenters and artists, mostly local residents. Due to the glowing reviews and wonderful feedback, they are already in the planning stages for the next event in 2021.

Linda has also written for numerous publications including [GoodTherapy](https://www.goodtherapy.org/therapists/profile/linda-mastrangelo-20160129), [SUFI](https://www.sufijournal.org/archives-97-summer-issue/), Lucid Dreaming Exchange, [Immanence](http://www.immanencejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fall-2016-Immanence-Journal-desktop-double-spread.pdf), Dream Network Journal, DreamTime Magazine, the Examiner and as a contributor for two highly anticipated books; [Sleep Monsters and Superheroes](https://products.abc-clio.com/abc-cliocorporate/product.aspx?pc=A4996C) and Dreams that Change Our Lives.
