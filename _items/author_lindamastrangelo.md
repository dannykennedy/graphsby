### Writing and Research
In 2009, Linda’s passion to share the wisdom of dreams blossomed into the first dream column for The Examiner . The intention was to write about dreams and the dreaming community and this labor of love has grown into a resource for the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. She currently writes about dreams for many other publications including; The Lucid Dream Exchange (LDE), The Dream Tribe , [Dream Network Journal](../@dreamnetwork), All Things Healing and DreamTime Magazine. Linda is also Editor of [Dream News](https://www.asdreams.org/dreamnewsletter/); an IASD monthly e-news publication.

### Alchemical Art
Linda has been illustrating and writing down her dreams for over twenty five years. Her process of these alchemically organic images can be closely described as creation through “waking dream.” The art emerges spontaneously and fluidly and, like the dream, can have a multitude of layers and meanings. Linda’s work has been shown internationally including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Prague and Amsterdam.

You can find her alchemical illustrations at the PsiberDreaming Gallery.

Her [Dream Alchemy Shoppe](http://lindamastrangelo.com/alchemical-art/) features dream inspired talismans for healing work.
