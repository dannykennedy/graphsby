Linton Hutchinson has been working with dreams for over thirty years. He first introduced the use of dreams at Stonesoup School an alternative program based on Summerhill that he and others created to meet the needs of students that were bored to tears in public school. Kids from 8 to 18 were part of a community that shared dreams in the morning, wore their dreams during that day, and played at mutual dreaming and lucidity as easily as you might watch TV!! The dream classes at Stonesoup integrated the Seth Material Jung, and Cayce, with Gestalt, drawing, sculpture and endless plays and dramas of the conflicts and resolutions of their dreams at night.

Linton went back to school finished his Masters in Counseling and later his Ph.D. at Union Institute in Psychology. His dissertation was on the Waking and Dreaming Need Profiles of medical students in Grenada, West Indies and how they integrated dreams in their learning process.

Since that time, Linton has taught dream courses at Rollins College and integrated them in mental health counseling courses at the University of the South Pacific, Nova University, and the University of Central Florida. He was the Regional Coordinator for Webster University's Mental Health Counseling program where graduate students learned Dream Translation techniques using [DreamLynx](http://www.Dreamlynx.com), a web site devoted to the translation of dreams that he and his wife Beck created.

Linton believes that having students realize that working with unconscious material can help clients facilitate change is important in the therapeutic process. Giving students the skills to augment this process has been a a goal and opportunity that he has used.
