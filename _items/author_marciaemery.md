**Marcia Emery, Ph.D** led a magical life, from being a pioneer in the field of applied intuition, and a traditional psychologist, consultant, and college professor to stepping out into the world of parapsychology, where she blends the study of intuition and dreams in her books and in the college classroom. Marcia authored three books: [Powerhunch!](https://www.amazon.com/INTUITION-INSTINCT-GREATER-PERSONAL-POWER/dp/0671572911), [The Intuitive Healer](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dr-Marcia-Emerys-Intuition-Workbook/dp/0130916889), and [Dr. Marcia's Intuition Workbook](https://www.amazon.com.au/Doctor-Marcia-Emerys-Intuition-Workbook/dp/0130916706). She received a Doctorate in Social Psychology from the New School for Social Research. Marcia pioneered the first-of-its-kind college course in “whole brain thinking”—targeting Master of Management candidates from international corporations, government, and small business. Active in the field of dreams, led to appearances as one of the three experts on the three hour mini-series, “Dream Decoders.” Marcia hosted the Voice America internet radio show, The Partnership of Intuition and Dreams and served as the Dream Expert for the America Now TV program that viewed weekly on select CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX stations around the country. Currently, Marcia leads dream study groups in Ashland, Oregon and the Bay Area, California.
