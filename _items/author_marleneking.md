I started my first dream journal at age 8. I have accumulated volumes since that are filled with images, feelings, symbolism and characters that never fail to educate and inspire me and elucidate my waking world. Working with people and their dreams is all about pulling in the pieces the unconscious hands us in our dreams and integrating them into waking life to add dimension and arrive at that “ah-ha” meaning.

As a professional art therapist and active member in the dream community for over 35 years, my approach to dreamwork is both intuitive and eclectic, and is sensitive to each person based on my toolbox of knowledge and experience of working with individuals and groups. A creative approach to dreamwork via expressive means can be done through journaling, art, dance, writing or Gestalting with dream imagery or any expressive method meaningful to the dreamer.

Marlene served on the board and was a regular contributor to [Dream Network Journal](../@dreamnetwork) for nearly two decades. Her column, “Dream Times,” appeared there and in the North Kitsap Herald. You can visit her blog, [www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com](https://www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com/), that contains inspirational true stories and reflections from her life.

Her inspirational novel, ***The Rainbow Watchers***, released in the fall of 2018, is spiritual fiction based on a true NDE (near-death experience) that explores the possibilities life has to offer on both sides of the veil.
