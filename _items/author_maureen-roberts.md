Maureen B. Roberts, PhD, has over 25 years experience in ‘mental health’ research, therapeutic practice, teaching, publishing, training & course facilitation. After working as a graphic artist, photographer, musician and pastoral care worker, in 1983-4 Maureen worked through an acute transformational crisis, and to help make sense of this self-rebirthing experience went through Jungian analysis in Australia. She later completed an original Doctoral thesis, a Jungian analysis of the life and works of the 19th century English poet John Keats.

She regards the 'mental health crisis' from a soul-centred perspective, in [her words](https://content.web-repository.com/s/98148739180315323/uploads/PDF/Soul_in_Crisis-2714841.pdf) _"I see a lot of so-called 'mental illness' as a reflection of cultural 'soul loss' and decry the spiritual poverty of a psychiatric model which views the rare gifts, insights and abilities which many sufferers - particularly of schizophrenia - have as 'mental illness'."_
