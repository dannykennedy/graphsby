I joined Dream Network Journal in the early '90s and enjoyed it until it stopped publishing. Everything was then lost to a fire and I thought I would never again have access to these great magazines.

Thanks to Daniel and Inoshi who compiled the collection, I am again able to enjoy and relive wonderful memories of this great work. I can't thank them enough for the joy and wonderful memories they allowed me to relive again. Thank you.
