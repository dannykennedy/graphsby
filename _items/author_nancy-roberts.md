Nancy Roberts fell in love with books as a child, and the love affair continues. As a television producer/talent, writer, book reviewer and blogger, she has been able to indulge her passion for literature, with an eclectic taste that runs from ancient history to science fiction, classical authors to speculative fiction and romance.
