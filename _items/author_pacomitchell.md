Paco Mitchell is a Jungian author, artist, therapist and editor, dedicated to the study of dreams, essay- and fiction-writing, and creative ventures in general. His interest in dreams focuses primarily on emergent levels of psychic development that take shape in the collective unconscious, and strive toward consciousness in the dreams and lives of individuals. Many of Paco's dream-related essays have been published in Dream Network Journal and Depth Insights, as well as The Angels (The Entities Trilogy), ed. by Robert Sardello. In addition to his Jungian studies and practice, Paco also taught Romance Languages (Spanish and French); worked as a sculptor and owner/operator of the Blue Heron Foundry (Art Bronze Casting); and for many years taught and performed on the flamenco guitar, both as a soloist, and as an accompanist to flamenco dancers and singers. He is co-editor of the Owl & Heron Press with [Russell A. Lockhart](../@ral), with whom he has co-authored the first two volumes of a trilogy, Dreams, Bones & the Future, subtitled A Dialogue and Queries & Speculations, respectively. The third volume, subtitled Endings, is under way and will be published in 2020. His latest release is The Paraclete of Caborca: A Collision with Destiny, available on Amazon.com at:
