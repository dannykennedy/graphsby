Stephen Aizenstat, Ph.D., pioneered his 'Dream Tending' methodology over four decades ago. It has since helped thousands of people realize their personal and professional potential.

> I believe that the DNA of our individual and planetary evolution is coded in the images of dreams. Combine this conviction with the idea that dream images not only live within us, they also exist all around us, in every animal, plant, and object of this world. Our dream images give meaning to our life’s story—the journey of who we are and who we are becoming. _~ Dr. Stephen Aizenstat_

Dr. Aizenstat founded the [Pacifica Graduate Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifica_Graduate_Institute) in Santa Barbara in 1976, with a focus on psychology, mythology, and the humanities. He has lectured around the world, advised Hollywood filmmakers on psychological content, consulted for leading tech companies, and collaborated with giants in the field such as Joseph Campbell, James Hillman, Marion Woodman and others. He is affiliated with the UN's Earth Charter International project.
