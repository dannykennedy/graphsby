[Strephon Kaplan-Williams](https://www.dreamwork-psychology.com/in-memoriam-strephon-kaplan-williams-1934-2009/) (1934 - 2009) was the founder of the Jungian-Senoi Dreamwork Institute in Berkeley, through which he published the [Jungian-Senoi Dreamwork Manual](https://archive.org/details/jungiansenoidrea00will/page/6/mode/2up) in 1978. In 1983-4 he founded the Association for the Study of Dreams (now IASD) with Patricia Garfield, Gayle Delaney, [Jeremy Taylor](../@jeremytaylor), soon joined by [Stephen LaBerge](../@stephenlaberge) and John Van Damm. He moved to the UK in 1987, where he first published his [Dream Cards](https://dreamwork2000.com/dreamcards_interactive.html) in 1991. They went on to sell over 100,000 decks.

The Jungian-Senoi Dreamwork Institute offered a professional training program in Jungian-Senoi dreamwork and psychology. Its methodology emphasized the deliberate alteration of dream states, the resolution in dreams of problems encountered in waking consciousness, dream 'rehearsal' for activity while awake and the application of dreams to creative individual and community projects. Its dream groups were for the general public as well as for interested professionals.

Kaplan-Williams was the son of the poet and anthologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Williams_(poet)">Oscar Williams</a> (born Oscar Kaplan) and poet-artist Gene Derwood.
