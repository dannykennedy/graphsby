Walt Stover originally worked in research and development for two Fortune 500 companies after receiving a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering.

His precognitive dreams started on a small scale in 1978. He [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20170516072437/http://www.intuitive-connections.net/issue3/stover.htm) that "I did not seek or ask for this information. It just spontaneously arose from by subconscious". From 1983 he used dreams about financial matters to inform his stock market investments.

He went on to receive his Master’s Degree in Transpersonal Studies in 2001 from Atlantic University. He is the author of [_Dreams—My Lamp unto the Darkness_](https://www.abebooks.com/9781587768569/Dreams-Lamp-Darkness-Walt-Stover-1587768569/plp). He passed away in 2019.
