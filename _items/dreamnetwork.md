# Thank you, Dream Network supporter!

As thanks for your very generous donation, here's something special. As promised, scans of the entire 1982-2015 Dream Network archive, hot off the press from the scanners. We've barely even had time to style this page, but as tribute to the [old DNJ site](https://web.archive.org/web/20060424062349/http://dreamnetwork.net/) we've pulled in a few styles:)
        
What a treasure trove this is. It's almost an embarrassment of riches, and we hope you enjoy perusing these for years to come.

Below, you can download each volume as a .zip file, or download each issue individually. If you'd like to look up an individual author or article, here's a (not-quite-complete) [list of Dream Network articles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfm83Fnx9m9Q_Bfu3bpDv2kQqUwDG6exOj-Zny-MnMw/edit?usp=sharing)

We have one request to make: Please don't publish or distribute any of these files yet. We'll be making the full archive public in early 2020. After that, feel free to send them to your friends, but again rather than publishing them online please just link to the archive site. We also ask you not to publish the articles in them, unless you have the permission of the author (or you are the author, in which case, the rights are yours!)

**Thank you** to everyone who donated to this campaign.
