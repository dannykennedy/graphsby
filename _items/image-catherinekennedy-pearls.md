*Pearls* was painted in 2013, but has become somewhat prophetic. Essentially it talks about fear and of a kind of a free-floating anxiety about things material and immaterial: of a future that may be no future at all. But even then, there was an intuitive sense of an unseen enemy that might be hiding in every corner, on every surface or in the air we breatheâ€¦ Battles aplenty over land and oil. Missiles and bombs and terrorist plots. But suddenly no defence against a tiny invisible foe that is moving and growing more quickly than we are able to comprehend.
