53”L x 34”W, Green velvet panel framed with gold brocade and black & gold ribbon.

**From a dream:**

> I am standing in a circle of women.  Someone gifts me with a snake from which sprouts the head of a fox.
> The snake, symbol of initiation and rebirth, arises from the green lavaliere and merges into red fox, symbol of feminine magic. Poised at the center of the upper circle of the lemnescate formed by the serpentine body is the phoenix, emblem of immortality. At the end of the snake’s tail hangs a small clear quartz crystal, a spiritual transmitter, and balanced on the bottom curve is a cross, representing the interpenetration of spirit into matter.
