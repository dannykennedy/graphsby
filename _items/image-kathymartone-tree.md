**From a dream:**

> *An elderly woman lives in a house with a large garden in her backyard, the centerpiece of which is a large old oak tree surrounded by a rock wall.*
> *Trees often represent the Great Goddess and here, she welcomes three faces of the Divine Feminine into her lofty branches.  The serpent reminds us of the wisdom of the feminine spirit, the white dove is Aphrodite’s symbol of fertility and the lion is guardian of the Great Mother.*
