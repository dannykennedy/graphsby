The Dream Network invites dream-related submissions of any media or genre - articles, artwork, poetry, letters to the editor and more. 

Please send your submissions to <a href="mailto:hello@dreamnetworkjournal.com">hello@dreamnetworkjournal.com</a>.

Copyright for all submissions remains yours. 

### Approximate 'Lifelines': (formerly 'deadlines')

* June 1 (publication mid-year)
* December 1 (publication around end of the year)

## Guidelines

Submissions should be dream related, or reflect a dreaming sensibility. Closely related ideas, such as investigating mythology from a psychological angle, might also be suitable. 
Currently we have no hard word limit for submissions. However 2500 words was the limit for the printed journal, and we prefer you to stick to that where possible.
We prefer submissions that have not previously been published online (unless they were previously in another language, or behind a login) For artworks this is less important, but we prefer artworks created in the last 5 years. 
We’d like most submissions to have visual content. If you can provide photos, art or diagrams to accompany your writing, that’s great. If not, we will try to find suitable accompanying visuals and run them by you. If you’re an artist and would like to illustrate a specific article, let us know. 
Art images should be at least 1000px on the longest side, and not blurry or pixelated.  
Please include the date of creation. 


## Ethos

We aspire to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams. It is our goal to unite individuals who respect their dreams, to demystify dreamwork and to integrate dreamsharing into our culture.

Our writers and readers consist of dream enthusiasts, students, professional dreamworkers and therapists: Dream questers, one and all. We invite experiential articles, accounts of a personal/transformative nature and well referenced educational information that will encourage readers to value their dreams and empower them in learning to understand symbolic and metaphoric language. We’re excited by the interface between dreams and the world - dreams and technology, dreams and myth, dreams and politics, dreams and …?

We’re actively looking for submissions from all dreamers - all backgrounds, all nationalities, all genders, all ages, all religions and irreligions. We want a culturally diverse Dream Network Journal, but please be mindful of cultural appropriation in your submissions. 

*Thank you for your interest in dreams & in the Dream Network*
