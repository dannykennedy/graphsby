A whisper of healing wisdom is woven throughout this compelling and often frightful story of a contemporary woman. Our author has made our protagonist so likeable and identifiable, that the reader easily adopts her as a friend that most can relate to. It is hard to leave this book set aside on the table as her life becomes gripping and curiously mysterious.

Kate, the main character, deals with horrific challenges planted in her life from the day of her birth. This story allows us to share with her the wounding that many women are haunted by in a family with mental illness. Kate suffered early abuse and, insidiously the trauma entangled itself in the precious unfolding of all her lifeâ€™s evolution. In so many invisible ways, the wounding constantly twists and strangles the true essence of a tiny child, a little girl, a young woman learning about love and intimacy, and then a wise being expanding into her vast spirituality.

And yet she lives her story with others as so many of us do. She manifests her incredible talents and gifts and her delightful personality with close friends as her secrets lie deeply buried but haunting her dreams, fantasies and perceptions. Through her, whether we too were horrifically abused or maybe scarred by the misogynistic dark cloud that all women in our world must struggle through, Kate teaches us all about the profound damage trauma and abuse causes. And we also are in awe at the great gifts that spring into being as one finds resolution through exploration and seeing clearly who we are. Kate models a courageous willingness to see the great self that is light and the traumatized self that was locked away in the dark and then liberated.

For all men and women alike, this story educates and stirs us all awake out of our unique darkness and into our light.

All the way through, this is an entertaining and engrossing story but - not to be a spoiler - there is a delightful surprise ending that is a great gift of liberation.
