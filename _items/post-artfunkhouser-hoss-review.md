<!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Dream Language: Self-Understanding through Imagery and Color by Robert Hoss (Ashland, OR: Inner-source Softback, 2005, 254 pages)</i></div><!--/nopreview-->
<br>

Robert Hoss, former scientist at IBM and mainstay of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) has compiled and published a very helpful book that brings together knowledge about dreams from an amazing array of sources. Mr. Hoss provides numerous tips about how an individual can work with his or her own dreams (especially any color that appears in them). It includes exercises at the end of most chapters.

I think it is ideally suited for courses in dreamwork at the high school or junior college level. I highly recommend this book.
