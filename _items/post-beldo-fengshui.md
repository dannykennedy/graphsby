The art of Feng Shui (translated: wind and water) involves arranging ones home to achieve harmony and prosperity with the surrounding natural environment. Feng Shui emphasizes that when we regard our living spaces as places to achieve such harmonies, the universe will reciprocate this in many ways by helping to improve the circumstances in our lives whether it be in the career area, family and ancestors or receiving help from angels and helpful spirits. One places what is called a [Ba-Gua grid](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-use-a-feng-shui-bagua-map) over a layout of the home to determine where these areas are and then arranges furniture and other objects such as mirrors and plants to invite more openness and to facilitate the flow of chi energy. In short, Feng Shui is really a kind of acupuncture for our homes.

If we look at our dreams from the perspective of Feng Shui, we can discover clues to where there are areas of stagnation in our unconscious minds which inhibit the flow of chi energy throughout our psyches. If we respond to such messages as practitioners of Feng Shui, we can greatly enhance harmonies not only in our outer but our inner environments as well.

It is interesting to note that in Feng Shui, closets and other storage areas (such as under the bed) are really representative of the unconscious mind of our living space. We often store things that never get used and which collect dust and inevitably become forgotten. Dreams of closets, for example, would indicate that we need to pay attention to what is within them: the closets in our dreams as well as the closets in our living spaces.

As an example, I once had the following dream:

> _I open my closet door and out spills a veritable Pandora's Box of evil, plague and other unsavory things. Yet they are all contained in the very objects that actually exist in the closet in my apartment. In particular, I notice a box that had not been opened for years. In spite of all the negative things pouring out of my closet, I reach in and pull the box out. I try to open it but some evil force prevents me from doing so._

Instead of analyzing the dream, trying to extract some kind of meaning from the symbols, I chose instead to regard the dream that I needed to clear out not only the closet in my dream but the front closet in my entry way.

I discovered that according to Feng Shui, the closet was situated in the area of helpful people, in the entryway of my apartment. So it seemed that my dream was urging me to make a connection with the fact that I had all these items clogging up the closet and blocking my connection with helpful people. I then re-entered the dream and faced the evil pouring out of the closet and began pulling out boxes, old clothes and other outdated things. I came across the box that had not been opened for years and immediately opened it. Inside were this litter of kittens. I let them out of the box and realized that they were in my dream for a reason.

Once I came out of this Feng Shui meditation, I then proceeded to clean out the actual closet and discarded all the unused items and in general cleared out the stagnation. I sat down and could feel the flow of chi energy improving. Now when I am in the area of the closet I sense that I am indeed connected to helpful people and angels. Even when it isn't obvious.

Feng Shui can be applied to our dreams in numerous ways. I suggest following these basic guidelines:

1. After writing your dream down, sketch out a diagram of the place you dreamed about as seen from an aerial perspective. Take note of anything you consider to be blocking the flow of chi energy. Using the principles of Feng Shui, determine what the area you dreamed of represents, i.e., career area, family and ancestors area, etc.
2. Reenter the dream by closing your eyes and visualize rearranging items and even introducing new items that will bring harmony to the dreamscape.
3. You may want to then address the area of your actual living space (in waking life) and make the appropriate changes to achieve harmony.
