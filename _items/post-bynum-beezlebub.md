<pre>
Beelzebub* knows the footing here. Mountains
infested with a cold smoke leer
over the town set thorning in rain.

Fields to the east clot with birds.
The pond thickens, a throat with phlegm.
A motel user walks his dog, catches

the steam from Its piss and flinches
at the intimation of death and God.
Beelzebub has found a witness.

Figures autograph the mist,
the dog growls without direction.
Diesels groaning up the highway

condense water on their hoods.
The cemetery has opened.
The escaped lizards, the phantoms

roam the countryside, the wind
In their stomachs. Horses alert,
thin spasm after spasm.

A hitchhiker gambles on the road.
The bloodsmell runs from his lungs,
stings the hunger, the unclean need

bats swarm to this like Piranha.
The hitchhiker turning from the road
sets up the scene for appetite

and dream to nightmare by the stream
that feeds the pond the Loons plead
on nightly til morning. Fire decreases,

the world burns out. Water Is a language
of frogs, ditches. His eyes catch, snakes have
their victims, everything feeds on transposition.

The dog wails with a snapped spine
a tire breaks when driver and alcohol
speed on. The motel walker screams,

sends the woodsleeper an erie dream
of burning, nerves lost In the blood. He awakens,
panic syringed into his veins.

Into the pond with its shrinking
waters, ringed with flats, scruffs
of grass, he runs, a wild bull

hit by shrapnel into the thickness
before the bottom. Mud flumes up,
a great, black cloak.

He comes to his senses.
The dog's wall drowns his screaming,
the half-formed and lizards

group in clumps by the shore.
He blooms there, gets his footing.
The fire burns completely out.
