The 19th release for [Gabrielle Roth](../bcpov6grroth/gabrielle-roth-interview-dance-it-is-holy) & the Mirrors is a deep exploration into the most relaxed of her 5Rhythms™. Sensuous and sinuous, flowing and trance-like, “Still Chilllin’” is both contemporary and ancient, easily combining modern electronic musical techniques with chanting and percussion. This blending is evocative of music you could imagine being played for dances in the desert tents of nomadic tribes or in the temples of the goddess. With 4 long tracks and impeccably executed instrumentation and vocals, you have a chance to fully enter into each composition. Because of this CD’s deep meditative and contemplative quality, it may be best to enjoy its musical experience in a still and relaxed state where driving in not involved. If you are hoping to hear a traditional romp through the 5Rhythms™, these pieces might sound repetitive. You will be much better served by an earlier release. If you are looking to center, to ground, to relax or you want something to play as background music for a healing or massage session, give “Still Chillin’” a try.
