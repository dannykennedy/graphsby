Based on the Toltec tradition of the guidance of the fundamental three masteries, Don Miguel Ruiz guides us through the third of these which is the Mastery of Love. If we can master love, we master life itself. One anonymous reviewer on Amazon.com called this book “a courageous exploration of what it takes to experience being human in all its fullness,” and I completely agree. It cuts to the chase with simple easy language and clear and concise reasoning. This is not so much a book about dreams as it is a book about self love.

If you are not well versed in the notions of boundaries, projections and expectations, personal accountability, core shame and family of origin issues, and you’d rather not spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in therapy unraveling it all, then this easy to comprehend audio CD is a delightful alternative. It will show you how impossible it is to find love in another when you are unable to locate it internally. You come to understand how you began as a perfect being and how your emotional life developed from that point of perfection. It quickly becomes obvious that there is a choice to follow a path of suffering and pain in an endless, recurring cycle (the dream of hell), or to make a conscious choice to break that cycle, master the dream and live in happiness. The how and why of broken hopes and relationships, the simplicity of cause and effect become instantly clear with a first listening of the audio book, and somehow even more so with repeated play.
