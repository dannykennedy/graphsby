There is a growing acceptance of the topic of dreams in academic institutions and a real desire and need for dream education at all levels of education. This book was conceived after a symposium presented at the 27th annual Conference of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) in 2010, where the dreams and education theme was heavily emphasized and supported.

*Weaving Dreams into the Classroom* is a compilation of chapters from 10 educator’s at all educational levels that address the subject of how to provide practical, hands-on models for bringing dreamwork to students of all ages.  The book is organized by level of instruction beginning with elementary and secondary education, undergraduate, graduate and adult education. Each chapter offers a diversity of approaches and shares each author’s perspective about their experience in bringing dreamwork into the classroom, detailing how they have facilitated dreamwork in academic settings.  Included are the challenges they have encountered as well as solutions in overcoming potential objections to incorporating dreamwork into curriculums.  

The chapters include examples of how educators organize their classes and how they incorporate various methodologies and dreamwork projects into their courses. Also discussed are types of dreams at different ages, the importance of the IASD Ethics Statement, examples of students dreams, how to orchestrate dream groups, the creative influence of dreams as a source of inspiration and imagination, the generative and transformative power of dreamwork, and the long term effect dreamwork has had on students from their point of view and how they are taking what they learned out into the world.  Common throughout the book is the tremendous benefit students have gained in learning about dreams, including increased intuition, self understanding, self-esteem, compassion and overall well being.  Also included are helpful resources throughout the book.  One chapter is even written by a young man who has worked with his dreams since childhood and was the youngest presenter in history at the IASD sharing how valuing dreams has influenced his life.

The authors also examine the decline of training in dreamwork in clinical psychology and questions why working with dreams is not a significant component of therapists’ training given the fact that the legend of psychology was founded on working with dreams.  Detailed are examples of how and why graduate students feel ill-equipped to do dreamwork with clients and suggestions to overcoming this problem.

One thing is certain; People’s lives are enhanced by dreamwork and the more opportunities given for people to learn about dreams, the stronger the possibility of affecting positive and conscious-centered change on this planet.  Students are our future. As *Weaving Dreams into the Classroom* tells us, they are the ones who will determine the choices, decisions and actions of future generations.  Providing classes that teach others about the wisdom of dreams and how to work with them offers a powerful foundation for healing, individually, collectively, ecologically and globally. By creating a renewed interest in dreamwork worldwide, we help to create dream-centered communities that embrace dreams not only as an integral part of life, but as a means of the continued existence of our, and other species.

*Weaving Dreams into the Classroom* is a tremendous resource for anyone desiring to bring dreamwork into their curriculum or who wants to develop and teach their own programs on dreams within or outside of institutional academia. It is extremely inspirational and informative in providing a multitude of thought-provoking ideas and tools for all types of educators. This is a unique book and comes at a significant time globally when there is a genuine need for dream education at all levels of learning. The authors present a persuasive case for teaching dreamwork in the classroom and their words should serve as a source of inspiration and encouragement for those interested in doing so.

Whether you are an educator or a person who is simply passionate about sharing the value of dreamwork with others, this is an essential book to read and add to your personal library.
