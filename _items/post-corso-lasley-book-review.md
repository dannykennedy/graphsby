Justina Lasley, MA is the Founder and Director of the Institute for Dream Studies in Charleston, South Carolina. She is also the author of _Honoring the Dream - A Handbook for Dream Group Leaders_ and _In My Dreams… A Creative Dream Journal_.

In her newest book, _WAKE UP! Use Your Nighttime Dreams to Make Your Daytime Dreams Come True_, Justina’s passion and love of dreams is evident as she teaches readers about the importance of remembering, journaling, and working with their night time dreams to live more fulfilling and joyful lives. Beginning with her inspiring personal story of change and transformation, Justina shares how awakening to the power of her dreams has impacted her life in countless positive ways and how it can do the same for you.

For the first time, Justina introduces her personal transformation process called DreamSynergy™ (DS), which uses theories of Transpersonal Psychology, acknowledging the relationship of mind, body, and spirit. DreamSynergy is designed to empower us to transform our lives into the ones we have always dreamed of, using our nighttime dreams as resources to awaken our most authentic, creative and spiritual selves.

Justina’s presentation of dream material is gentle, encouraging and highly inspiring. From cover to cover, WAKE UP! presents an abundance of dream information and dream tools, including how to remember and record your dreams, how to work with symbols and metaphors, dreamwork exercises and how to use your own dreams on a daily basis for growth and development. She educates readers on understanding the language of dreams, including the meaning of dream settings, colors, numbers, animals, dream themes, emotions, archetypes and so much more. The book sites multiple examples that reflect on the challenges we all often face in everyday life such, as relationships, careers, finances, health and personal development.

In addition to her book, Justina is also creating an online course via interactive video training for the DreamSynergy process. The release date has not yet been announced; however further information can be found on Justina’s website, [DreamSynergy.com](https://dreamsynergy.com/).
