We suffer pain or trauma or abuse.  We are compelled to make a painful life choice, such as leaving a partner or a job or a home, and part of us resists that choice and still clings to the old relationship or the old place. Sometimes the choice is not even ours and we experience a deep sense of loss. We fall into depression or addiction or make compromises with the world as we understand it, thus giving up on our big dreams of life and leaving a piece of us behind.

We all know the pain of needing to let go, while continuing to hold on for dear life. We ebb and we flow, we gain and we lose, we love and we long for. Meanwhile our dreams remind us that we have left something behind, a part of our self, a part of our soul.

Bestselling author and world-renowned dream explorer Robert Moss addresses this subject in his newest book, _Dreaming The Soul Back Home: Shamanic Dreaming for Healing and Becoming Whole_. Moss understands that these challenging life situations often create a loss of our vital life energy and identity, and he adroitly speaks to the healing affects that dreams have on recovering these lost aspects of our souls.

_Dreaming the Soul Back Home_ is a practical tool and experiential guide in soul recovery and of all of Moss’s books, this is my favorite. “Dreams not only show us what the soul wants, they also show us where it has gone,” writes Moss. He teaches us about soul loss, what it is, how it happens, and how dreams come to us to assist in the healing process. He shares common presentations of dream imagery that we can all relate to when some aspect of soul loss has affected us. “We dream again and again of the old place, or Grandma’s house, or high school, or the house we shared with a former partner. These dreams may be telling us that we left part of our vital energy and identity in that phase of our lives. Or, we may dream of a younger same-sex companion and find we are dreaming of a younger aspect of ourselves that went missing at her age because of bad things that were happening… Again and again in dreams, our higher or Greater Self comes stalking us, giving us the chance to forge a connection that may bring more of soul or spirit into the body than was with us before.”

Dreams, in their infinite wisdom and homeopathic nature help us to reunite with these lost parts of ourselves so that we may bring more of our spirit back into our body to live a fuller, more complete life. Infused with an indigenous quality in approach, this is a breakthrough book on a subject that deserves deep attention and care because we all experience this type of soul loss at some point in our lives.

_Dreaming the Soul Back Home_ consists of 15 chapters, including Dreamers as Shamans, Understanding Soul Loss, Dream Roads to Wholeness, The Royal Road to Soul Recovery, House of Healing and Ancestral Healing and Spiritual Release. Numerous exercises are given throughout the book allowing the reader to work with his various techniques first-hand. In addition, Moss shares many examples of the ways in which soul speaks to us through dreams.

This book is a must-have for anyone who is interested in dreamwork because it is so unique and insightful. I found myself fascinated by every chapter and I experienced epiphanies throughout my entire reading of Moss’s book. He shared new ways of working with dreams that I had not considered and I embraced the idea of becoming my own shaman so that I could help promote my own healing and wholeness. This book is an exquisite addition to the dreaming community and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys working with dreams for personal growth, development and healing.
