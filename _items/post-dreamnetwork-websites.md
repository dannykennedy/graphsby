#### About Dream Temple

_This text was not available in the Dream Network Journal, but was available on the advertised [Dream Temple Website (Web Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20030707071347/http://www.dreamtemple.com/index.html) at the time that the Dream Network endorsement was published_

Dreams are amazing. Most of you know this. Many of you have probably had life-changing insights, or made life-changing decisions based on a dream, or some form of guidance that came to you in a dream-like state. What better purpose for technology than to help you watch the mysteries of your Life unfold!

How would I benefit from keeping my dream journal on my computer?

For starters, imagine how nice it would be run the spell checker on you dream, format text, and attach images to your dream entry. What about those times when you're trying to remember a dream but all that comes to mind is that there was a frog in it. Wouldn't it be great to just type in a keyword or phrase and find your dreams instantly instead of flipping through pages. Now that you've found a group of dreams you can now keep notes on this group of dreams. Perhaps I want to print them out and bring copies for my dream group. Presto, they're printed.

Now imagine that you don't have to imagine this anymore that the tool you need is right in front of you. You say to yourself "do I take the opportunity or do I wait for something else?" Before I make my decision perhaps I could get some idea of what this software might look like, so I take a tour of the Dream Temple. I finish the tour and the web site tells me that I can download a copy of the Dream Temple for free to try it out. The dream becomes a reality!
