Others have done a superb job of describing [Stanley Krippner](../@stanleykrippner) and his reputation as an inveterate traveler and good-will ambassador, making impactful connections throughout our world. Stan is truly “The Man” when it comes to pioneering and researching new frontiers of mind and space—a fearless cosmonaut.

At IASD’s first conference in San Franciso in 1984, Stan spoke on [_Dreams and the Shamanic Tradition_](../bcpoz7zfasad/shamanism-and-dreams), another interest of mine, the spiritual and healing aspects of dreams. Subsequently I have spent nearly 24 years touching in with Stan at our IASD conferences, but also by phone and online.

No matter how busy, Stan never turned away a query that I sent him from our Central Office in Virginia. He was always open and friendly, though keeping to the business at hand with a professionalism that was striking. As IASD’s President in 1993-1994, he was an exemplary leader and guided us to proper decisions and actions. He continues to share his wisdom at board meetings and online. Coming back from his many trips, he faces hundreds of e-mails which he answers, supporting everyone from beginning students to established colleagues and researchers. Serious when need be, Stan can also be great fun—watch him at IASD Dream Balls!

Despite his fame and well-deserved awards, Stan is a humble hard worker. An example: Years ago [Bob Van de Castle](../@bobvandecastle) came to Washington DC for a meeting. On the day we’d planned to lunch together, he called to say he’d bumped into Stan and could we three eat together? Fine!

I met them in the lobby of the hotel. Having no place special lined up, we just decided to walk up the street and look around for a likely place. It was a very hot and humid, typical DC summer weather. I asked Stan if he didn’t find it overwhelming. No problem. He said he had learned to be agreeable to the environment wherever he was. Hmmm.

He was carrying a seemingly heavy bag and when I wondered why he didn’t leave it behind at the hotel, he explained it was full of papers written by his students at Saybrook which he was reviewing and using any spare minutes to work on them. Hmmm.

As we walked up the street, we saw a restaurant, [Duke Zeibert’s](https://wtop.com/dc/2018/09/duke-zeiberts-dominion-how-an-iconic-restaurant-brought-old-dc-together/), an establishment where the power people of Washington used to meet. It surely was a convenient location, but I doubted we could get in without reservations. As we walked up the elegant entry stairs, there at the top was the host himself, [Duke Zeibert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Zeibert), a man of great influence in DC.

“Stan!” Duke called out with great surprise and delight, running forward to embrace him in a warm hug! Stan had never mentioned that he knew Duke, who led us to one of the best tables in the house. We had a simple lunch and enjoyed our time together, no fuss, no fanfare. I was reminded of the advice given by an Old Testament prophet: _Act justly, love tenderly and walk humbly on one’s path._ Thanks, Stan, for leading us so well.
