_Save the date! June 21-25, 2025._

To make this yearâ€™s conference even more accessible to dreamers worldwide, in 2025 conference is held fully online. The virtual conference is designed to be live-streamed and interactive providing you with the same range of events that attendees have come to appreciate at our on-site conferences.

The 2025 IASD International Dream Conference includes:

-   5 days of lectures, symposia, panels
-   interactive workshops
-   morning dream groups (English, Spanish and French!)
-   virtual receptions
-   an online art exhibit
-   a dream telepathy contest
-   and even a virtual dream ball.

[Dan Kennedy](../@dan), the humble webmaster of this site, will also be presenting about mapping the locations that people have dreamt about around the world. He will be presenting with [Andrusa Lawson](https://www.divinebydesign.org/website-active/about-us).
