Traditionally, technology is not linked to the world of visualization, regenerative processes or dreams. Technology is thought to be too narrow to contain or support that delicate, yet ever-so-strong inner world. It would seem that the binary, on-off logic would render dreams lifeless and bruised. Yet the computer provides qualities that surprisingly lend themselves to dream work. Two of these qualities are storage and retrieval of the dream report, and text editing.

In the development of a dream translation program for the Apple Computer, these two qualities have been incorporated. The software is designed to translate the dream report into a format that substitutes meaning for symbology. This is accomplished through the creation of an expanded, second dream report using the individual's personal symbology.

This one-to-one correspondence between symbol and meaning is only one technique and is not intended to fully contain the total meaning of the dream report. What it does provide is an alternative view that opens up other possibilities for self-exploration.

In the past these rigid formulas (symbol = meaning) were used for gleaning understanding from the dream. To dream of teeth falling out meant that you were pregnant. Period. No ifs, ands, or buts. The individual's dream reality was narrowed and constricted to fit a pre-fabricated system that had the effect of decreasing the understanding of the dream rather than enhancing it.

With the advent of 20th century technology, the individual is now able to create and store his or her own data bank of dream symbols, and access them within a matter of seconds. These are then used in a substitution process to generate a second expanded dream report. The second dream report is a natural outgrowth of the individual's own understanding of his or her own dreams. As the personal data bank of dream symbols is constantly updated, the second dream report reflects the person's current life changes.

## Example: Original Report

> _I am in an old-fashioned puritan village. All the colors are softened like an old film. Everywhere people are dressed up in puritan costumes and are enacting small scenes from the Bible. They perform them naturally as part of their lives. I, too, am dressed like a puritan. We are going to a production. Loretta is driving a V.W. We go around a country lane that has hedges sticking out which we can not see around, so we have ta go very slowly. We arrive at the school. We are sitting in the back row. Some guys are sitting next to me and I ask them to move over so I can save a place for Robert. Outside I see the characters in the play._

## Second Dream Report: Created by using the individual's personal symbology data bank

> _A part of myself is in an old-fashioned controller community. All the moods are softened like an old sequence. Everywhere people are dressed up in controller disguise and are enacting small scripts from the life. They perform them naturally as part of their lives. A part of myself, too, is dressed like a controller. We are going to a revelation. Saboteur is driving cheap transportation. We go around primitive route that has obstacles sticking out which we can not see around, so we have ta go very slowly. We arrive at the place of growth. We are sitting in the back perspective. Some guys are sitting next to me and a part of myself asks them to move over so a part of myself can save a place for light. Outside a part of myself sees the roles in the belief examples._

The computer generated report ensures an abstracted perspective built upon the individual's personal view of the dream symbols. Therein lies the major effort on the part of the individual of creating a personal dream symbology which becomes the link between the dream and the computer.
