Are you able to recall dreams? If so, do you write them down? Have you ever tried posing a question before retiring in order to dream a solution? With practice, these concepts can be achieved. Throughout the day, remind yourself: 

> *“I want to remember my dreams.”* 

> *“Upon awakening, I will recall and write down my dreams.”* 

Incubating a question helps me to have dreams. 

Entice yourself to savor this rejuvenating nightly experience. Create a relaxing environment in your bedroom. Decorate with a dream catcher and soothing srroundings. Maintain a comfortable room temperature. 

Before retiring, enjoy your bedtime rituals. Take a warm bath and put on comfortable night clothes. Drink warm milk or herbal tea. Read a few pages on dreaming. There are numerous books on the subject. The internet also has information. Let yourself unwind. 

Keep a few items close to the bed so that you don’t have to lift your head or move much upon awakening. It’s easier to recall dreams when you remain in bed with your head on the pillow. Move as little as possible to reach your dream journal, pen and flashlight. If it’s easier for you to verbalize, use a hand held recorder and tape to document your dreams. Do what works best for you. 

Dreams and the Tarot deck of cards contain symbology. This form of language can help you gain knowledge about yourself and life. There are many versions of the Tarot. Select a deck that you feel drawn to and take your time getting familiar with them. There are seventy-eight cards in a deck. Fifty-six cards make up the Lower Arcana which are divided into four suites: wands, cups, swords and pentacles. 

The Higher Arcana is based on twenty-two archetypes. They can help in your life’s journey when you invoke them in dream incubations. Consider a challenge in which you need help. Ask a specific deity a question on how to deal with your situation. This can bring about a dream that will give you a solution.

Before going to sleep, write down the date and dream incubation in your dream journal. Draw or select a Higher Arcana archetype that you think will be able to help figure out your given situation. Meditate on the card and question before falling asleep. When you awaken, document your dreams. Don’t hold back, edit or judge what you have experienced. Let the thoughts flow freely. If you can’t remember a dream, jot down symbols, words, thoughts, ideas or anything else that comes to mind. Light your path to wholeness. With time, practice and consistency, you will become more in tune with your inner guide.
