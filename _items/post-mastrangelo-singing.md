<div style="text-align: center;">
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I awoke to this strange sound coming from outside my window.<br>
After a while, it occurred to me it was coming from the trees.<br>
They were creating music; they were singing!<br>
I was filled with inexplicable joy at the wonder of this.<br>
It all made sense somehow, like the ‘Pythagorean Music of the Spheres.’<br>
How the Universe is alive and we are all making music!<br>
