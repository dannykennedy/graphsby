> *I have a book that has ten spiritual questions on the cover as its title. I am giving it to a friend who is deeply concerned with transformation. Then the door to the house opens, and President Obama enters, hesitantly, asking permission by his humble posture. He looks at the book and I see that he wants it.*
> *“Take it,” I say.* 
> *I understand in this moment that he is longing for an opportunity for consciousness, for a way deep into his soul.* 
> *Later, he comes to the door again. His longing is visible. Then he is standing on the roof of the ten story building across the street that is visible through a window in my house. He looks miniscule. A very small man at the top of the world. He may be the most important man or most powerful man in the world, but he is such a small man, looking down on the street, the world, with such a sad expression. What he sees makes him so sad. He feels the loss in the world and the loss of the consciousness he can’t access. He wants to access it. He wonders and I wonder—seeing him there, so isolated, so alone, so fragile—how to make a bridge to it.* 

If we believe that dreams are sent by Spirit to enlighten us, to teach and instruct us in how to live, this dream calls for empathy and deep compassion. 

How might we find non-conventional ways to support the President so that he can act in accordance with the soul promises he made and believed in? How might we help protect him from the exigencies, dangers, the insanity of these times, and from the old guard that always surrounds a president? 

How might we be alongside him so he can be alongside himself? How can we be alongside him so that he can govern, as I believe he wants to do, with absolute integrity? How can we, together, step out of the pattern of fear, conflict, violence, and on-going judgement that is overwhelming the country, while also finding the viable ways to justice, peace and restoration? 

How might we, together, read and live accordingly to the ten questions on the cover of the book? How do we incorporate the possible answers in our daily lives on behalf of the future and all beings? 

Here’s another question: What were the ten questions on the cover of the book that, if addressed, offer transformation?
