*“Astral Injection” by Orna Ben-Shoshan*

This painting was featured on the cover of Volume 31, #4 of the Dream Network Journal.

What happens to you a moment before you wake up? The soul returns from distant dream realms, getting ready to re-enter your physical body. Guardian angels escort the soul and ensure its safe arrival.
