<!--nopreview--><h3>We Can Improve, by <a href="../marieotte">Marie Otte</a></h3><!--/nopreview-->

<pre>
Sometimes I weep, 
for social injustice, 
escalating violence, 
the starving poor, 
pandemic sickness and death. 

Sometimes I pray,
for respectful encounters, 
all weapons to evaporate, 
more food on the planet, 
and a remedy for Covid-19. 

I always dream of...
equality for all, 
people living in peace, 
everyone having plenty of food, 
Light for the deceased and health for all of humanity!
