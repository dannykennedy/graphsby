_“I am in a mining pit of Mount Antero. It somehow looks all paved and smoothed over. I sit down and right in front of me are some aquamarine crystals. I scoop them up and put them in my pack. Then I look up and see people coming through a doorway from the other side of the mountain all the way on top. They are tourists and have taken a walk up here. I go up there and get in line.”_

This book/sculpture is the result of this dream. I believe the dream is a result of the previous night calling on my “healed ancestors” in my bloodline to assist me in my own healing of family issues.
