I finally did a trek to the high Himalayas and stayed in my cave. How I wish I could describe the beauty! I went up in the pouring rain and stayed there in the fog and rain, so I couldn't see the mountains in front of my face. But the mist made for an incredible mystique, sometimes barely showing craggy mountain silhouettes, tantalizing my eyes. And there were shadowy images of really tall yet scraggly, dripping, moss-&-fern ridden deciduous trees too.

The fog caused me to focus on the foliage. It's funny how nature has color and harmony and number themes. It's art. Most of the plants up there have multiples of three and five, though they are of completely different species.

Usually it's three leaves and flowers with five petals (there are many strawberry-like plants). There's a message here, but we're too removed to get it. There were mandalas everywhere, with petals leading us into the Middle where union of Pollen and Ovum happen, which causes simultaneous birth (seed) and death (wilting). It's the same religion, over and over, every where, in infinite forms and brilliant colors, and in various number symbols. It just happens to be three and five here. Something to suit every taste. Half comes from below (ovum) and half appears to come from above (pollen), but it ALL ultimately comes from the same place and returns there! Everything is in good taste (and tastes good) in this world of balance.

On my last evening, the clouds blew away and within 15 minutes as the sun lowered, it revealed the craggy Himalayas, glowing rosecolor! And there were both billowing clouds and swirling clouds above, and foggy clouds flowing like rapid streams over and through the mountains below, like it was all staged. So incredible! Dreamlike! Paradise! Some Czech friends I met up there shared the startling view with me. I'm glad I didn't have a camera to do it injustice.
