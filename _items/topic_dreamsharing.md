The Dream Network Journal published the following _ethical guidelines for dreamworkers and dreamsharing groups_ in [Volume 13, Issue 1](../bcphbqvckd7/13.1), and different versions in subsequent issues.

### An ethical dreamworker:

1. **Encourages** those who have not yet discovered, or who are yet only beginning to discover, the magic, revelation and enrichment which comes from valuing their dreams. Not that they may know our dreams, but that they may know their own. _John Ashbaugh_
2. **Honors** the dream, the dreamer and the dreamsharing process. _Ingrid M. Luke_
3. **Encourages** any dreamer's personal connection to, relationship with and understanding of dreams and the mystery from which dreams emerge. _Catherine Knapp_
4. **Offers** encouragement to the dreamer for their efforts, knowing that any effort will bear fruit. Regards all dreams and dreamers as sacred and as such, treats them with respect, joy and humility. _Jan Janzen_
5. **Engages** in the Art of Listening. This involves listening to all that a dreamer says and above all, listening while keeping one's own ideas about the dream on hold. [_Montague Ullman_](../@montagueullman)
6. **Respects** the integrity of dreamers; their vulnerability, weaknesses and sexuality are to be honored, never exploited. It is often useful to preface any remark with the idea: "if it were my dream... " [_Jeremy Taylor_](../@jeremytaylor)
7. **Honors and respects** the dreamer's anonymity and confidentiality. _Will Phillips_
8. **Intuits** the dreamer's boundaries and does not push the dreamer to go beyond what feels safe. _Deborah Jay Hillman_
9. **Keeps in mind** that dreams are more a mystery to behold than a puzzle to solve. Dreams are about wonder, awe and imagination, in lieu of logic and literal thinking. _Chuck Freeman_
10. **Enters** a relationship with a dreamer and a dream, holding regard for the mystery of the dream process and respect for the sacredness of the individual's personal discovery of truth. _Valerie Meluskey_
11. **Refrains** from telling the dreamer what his or her dream means; we never know anyway. When we feel that we do know, at best we know what it would mean if it were our own dream. [_Dick McLeester_](../@dickmcleester)
12. **Recognizes** that dreams can be viewed as holograms, offering various levels of meaning and significance. Therefore, our challenge, when working with dreams is to continue searching for the layers within the dream and to allow the dream to "live" with us. _Rosemary Watts_
13. **Encourages** each member in a dream group to take responsibility for the healthy functioning of the group. This includes: setting rules for the group; speaking up when rules are broken and/or the group is not working for you; checking from time to time to make sure the group's process is working for everyone. _Micki Seltzer_
14. Relaxes when working on another's dream and trusts that s/he does not have to know the answers. _Karen Surman Paley_
15. **Respects** the dreamer's right to end the dreamwork at any time. _Will Phillips_
