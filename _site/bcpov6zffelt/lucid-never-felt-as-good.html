                        <p><!--nopreview--><h2>The birth of my new dream-inspired song</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>This song and the fact that I chose to record it are inspired by a number of dreams. I have experienced many dreams spread over a couple decades that encourage me to record and share more music. Many such dreams involve various famous musical artists. These come at least monthly, sometimes weekly, and occasionally more often. I am lucky to be amongst the tiny percentage of people whose dreams include music and sound. </p>

<p>My newly released song <em>“Lucid (Never Felt As Good)”</em> was originally inspired by a music-only dream where I “received” the lyrics and melody from the song’s opening line and chorus. Just before I awaken, I clearly hear a disembodied voice singing, <em>“Wherever I’ve been in my life, I’ve never felt as good as when I’m with you.”</em> This type of dream melody with lyrics is not unusual for me, but I liked the tune and decided to experiment with it on guitar. Within a few weeks, I composed more lyrics and created a chord pattern and song structure around the dream melody. That was the easy part. </p>

<p>Then came another dream, again music only: <em>I hear the last few notes of the song’s guitar solo bridge as a distorted electric guitar.</em> Again no visuals, but what seems to me a clear suggestion from the muse to switch the feel from acoustic/folk to more rock and roll, especially for the solo. The sound of the electric guitar solo in the recording is much like I heard it in the dream. I recorded the song with friends but the quality was low. Dreams urged me to again record more music and I decided to revisit this song since I felt it was kind of catchy. The recording-arranging process spread over 10 months. In that time, I had multiple dreams encouraging me to continue recording and arranging it. Towards the end of arranging, I had a breakthrough evening where I found the sound I was looking for. I went to sleep very late, but happy. In the morning, I had what felt like a celebration dream: </p>

<p>*A spiritual teacher of mine is strolling along the red carpet. Waking, the dream feels related to the song. *</p>

<p>A week or so later, when I was having trouble blending the mix, another dream came: </p>

<p><em>I’m with my sister at the breakfast table, listening to the current mix with her. It seems that the mixing process is dragging on far too long on the last few notes. I am also shocked to hear that the drums and guitar arrangement has been changed and now sounds quite heavy metal, though it sounds good in an unusual way. At that point, I decide not to change the arrangement any further.</em></p>

<p>Within a couple weeks of completing the recording, Grace has blessed this song with air play on about 150 radio stations so far and I am very grateful. </p>

<p>Among other music I’ve composed, dreams also inspired the recording of my fun environmental song Polymers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU</a></p>

<p>Life has now blessed me with well over a thousand lucid dreams, so to share some of the dream and lucidity skills and insights that have come my way, I lead lively online interactive teleclasses about how to harvest dreams for creativity (music, art, inventions, film etc.), healing, life path guidance, spiritual growth, adventure, etc. ℘ </p>
