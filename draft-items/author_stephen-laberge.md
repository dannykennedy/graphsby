[Stephen LaBerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_LaBerge) is a notable American psychophysiologist who has made significant contributions to the study of lucid dreaming. After obtaining his bachelor's in mathematics in 1967, LaBerge earned his Ph.D. in psychophysiology from Stanford University in 1980, where he also developed the MILD technique to induce lucid dreams. He founded [The Lucidity Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lucidity_Institute) in 1987 to further research on lucid dreaming and offer instructional courses on the subject to the public.
