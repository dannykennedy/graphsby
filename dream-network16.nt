<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfmanw> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><em>At a most fascinating time in my life when I was learning how life can respond in real time to the lessons I was /am learning internally, I had the following experience:</em></p>\n\n<p>One summer night, I am walking on the street towards the subway. A car passes with dogs barking out of the window. The barking reminds me of a quote I had read recently about \u201Clistening to the barking dogs of the unconscious\u201D (i.e. noticing subtle experiences like nightmares that try to catch our attention with an important message). The driver stops and asks directions and I gladly tell him how to find the street he is looking for. I continue to the subway, contemplating a principle I seem to be learning in my life, symbolically exemplified by the passing car and barking dogs... about how it is wise to give help to people when they ask for it. I don\u2019t think it applies in every situation but there seems to be some truth to this principle, at least spiritually speaking. Like Jesus might have meant when he said, <em>\u201CAsk and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened.\u201D</em></p>\n\n<p>As I descend the subway stairs, I am a little lost in my thoughts when I see an old gentleman slowly hobbling down the steps with a cane. Without thinking twice, I ask him if he needs help. He does not look at me but he does say something very odd: <em>\u201CAs I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn\u2019t there.\u201D</em> He has a British accent, which is quite unusual in Montreal. I\u2019m confused by his response, yet out of good will I repeat my offer to assist him. He shakes his head and says,<em>\u201CIt might be a little convoluted, but hopefully you get the point.\u201D</em> </p>\n\n<p>Well, I don\u2019t get it, but I wish him well and continue down another couple flights to the subway. Nearing the bottom, it strikes me that perhaps the old gentleman is trying to help me learn the precise lesson I was contemplating as I entered the subway, since I twice offered him help when he hadn\u2019t asked for it. I immediately run back up two long flights of stairs to speak to him again. </p>\n\n<p>At the speed he was hobbling down the steps\u2014unless he was completely faking it\u2014there is no way he could have either passed me or even turned back and left the subway. In the 20 or 30 seconds it takes me to sprint back to where he <em>should</em> still have been, there was, amazingly, nobody there! </p>\n\n<p>His peculiar statement suddenly seems to make sense. He said, <em>\u201CAs I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn\u2019t there.\u201D</em> I laugh at the magic of the moment and return to catch my train, no older gentleman anywhere to be seen. \u221E </p>\n\n<p><em>Craig offers highly transformational online classes in Applied Dreaming, Dream Interpretation, and Lucid Living.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfoldd> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>It was time to dig those old dream journals out of the basement. Yes, they were all there stored in plastic storage containers, thirty-three years worth. The early journals were 9\u00BD by 6 inch spiral notebooks. That spiral format had many advantages. Those notebooks could be opened and laid flat and were easy to write in even when lying in bed. And, the day\u2019s events could be recorded on the left side with the resulting dreams of the next morning beginning on the right. They also came in all different colored covers adding a bit of fascination to them. Years later, larger format spirals replaced the small ones only to be replaced still later by three ring binders. </p>\n\n<p>With all of those journals, the question was where to start. An approach that included spot reviews of dreams from ten, twenty, and thirty years ago was appealing. Opening one of the containers, however, revealed the very first notebooks. My plan went out the window. Those early notebooks were just too fascinating to be ignored. My dream work had begun just before my daughter was born. There were the documented worries about Elizabeth who had developed toxemia toward the end of her pregnancy. There was the record of an early dream incubation to let me know what I could do to help her. The dream came through in a simple piece of music, \u201CIt\u2019s Sleepy Time down South.\u201D The message was clear. I just need to help her get as much sleep as possible. </p>\n\n<p>The faithfully kept records of days\u2019 events were there too: the exhaustion from getting the nursery ready, even a comment my mother had made that she had climbed up on a chair to hang curtains the day before I was born. There were notes about all the help we had gotten from friends and neighbors. Then of course notes about the joy I experienced when Shannon was born and how amazing it was, just to hold such a precious and beautiful little person. </p>\n\n<p>In true synchronistic fashion, the early journals revealed other things of interest to my current waking life: the name of an old friend that had been eluding me; and toy train dreams that fit in with a problem I\u2019ve been having trying to fix a toy locomotive.</p>\n\n<p>Having given up on the idea of an organized dream search, I followed an impulse to look up the circumstances surrounding the writing of my first article for the Dream Network Journal in 1987. There it was, a note that my article had been published, with a star drawn next to the note showing how pleased I was. </p>\n\n<p>But while looking for references to the DNJ article, I came across a dream of my daughter\u2019s when she was five years old, in her last year of preschool. The dream had been a favorite for years. I remembered it being about a scary monster wearing yellow boots. Because of the dream, I spoke to Shannon\u2019s teacher about little Ritchie, who I recalled wearing yellow boots to school and w known to bite other children. In a quickly arranged conference, the teacher reassured me that Shannon was safe and that she almost never interacted with Ritchie.</p>\n\n<p>As written, however, Shannon\u2019s dream was much different than I remembered. </p>\n\n<p>*I was going that way and I saw a man with big green boots. You know? Like Ritchie\u2019s boots. He was going in big high puddles. I wanted to kiss my mom. He let me kiss you dad because mom wasn\u2019t home. Then he took me home. I\u2019m glad that dream didn\u2019t come true. I don\u2019t like dreams that come true. *</p>\n\n<p>The dream was multi-layered. The meanings, which related to school, big men, high puddles, home, and Shannon\u2019s relationships with her mom and me, are still not entirely clear. On one level, the man represented Ritchie. I had taken action on that assumption. A brief entry the next day indicated that I was with Shannon when she drew pictures of the big man from her dream who wore green boots. Taking control of the big man in her drawings had been effective. He did not return to her dreams. I don\u2019t recall if I had dealt with the dream issue of Shannon\u2019s mom being unavailable or if I encouraged Shannon to share the dream with her mom; but if it had happened today, I would. Her mom and I would have discussed Shannon\u2019s need for reassurance, concerning her mom\u2019s availability. The outcome might have at least resulted in Shannon getting some additional cuddling and an extra kiss or two. </p>\n\n<p>As a young mother herself, I wondered what Shannon would recall of the incident all these years later. Because she lives nearly a day\u2019s drive from me, I scanned and attached the dream journal page to an email and gave Shannon a follow-up call. Shannon said that the dream seemed unusual to her in a couple of ways. In the dream, her mom was not home, but she recalled her mother as always being at home. The dream did not trigger thoughts about her mom being unavailable. Reading the dream, however, did trigger memories of her being a very frightened child. To me, Shannon hadn\u2019t seemed to be a particularly frightened child. During our conversation, I learned about some of her childhood concerns of which I had been unaware. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually our conversation moved back to the present and the topic of availability. Shannon wanted to make sure that I would continue to be accessible to her and the grandchildren. We realized that we hadn\u2019t been visiting as much as we would like. As a result, we scheduled visits that we\u2019re both very much looking forward to.</p>\n\n<p>After putting down the phone, I felt much better about having carted those dream journals around for so long. They not only helped correct and enlarge on old memories, they also confirmed the enduring importance of old dreams. Because dreams are so relevant to the present and come with perfect timing, it may be tempting to discard dreams after they have been read and interpreted, the way we used to discard day old newspapers. Luckily for me, I had kept those old dreams as well as some of my daughter\u2019s. Randomly finding and revisiting one of my favorite dreams of hers was more valuable than finding a gemstone. That old dream had helped strengthen our relationship when she was only five and helped re-strengthen it again over a quarter of a century later. And the icing on the cake was that it provided the catalyst for strengthening relationships with my granddaughter Annabelle, who just happens to be approaching age five, and her three-year-old brother Alex. </p>\n\n<p>After looking at all those old dreams, they with a doubt have relevance for the present and don\u2019t seem to be quite so old after all. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfwake> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>In the process of living, I often incubate a dream to get information. So, in keeping with the current Dream Network theme, I turned to dream incubation to give me additional understanding about the experience of living one's life as if it were a dream. </p>\n\n<p>My incubated dreams are often quite understandable so I was expecting to get some quick and easy to understand information. Instead, I got a middle-of-the-night dream about a family that had been getting light over a period of years. The meaning of light as well as other dream elements, however, all lacked clarity. The dream itself seemed to be more like the waking process of \u2018brainstorming\u2019 often used to generate ideas. </p>\n\n<p>After jotting down the dream, I had to use the bathroom. Without turning on any lights, I walked into the bathroom and saw a star through the window, beautifully framed by an opening in the surrounding tree branches. I realized that the light of the star could in some way be a continuation of the focus on light in my dream. As I turned from the window, my attention was caught by a lighted wall switch. The thought occurred to me that seeing lights could be the beginning of a waking nightmare experience if I allowed it to be. That realization triggered more thoughts of lights before I was able to bring the train of thought to a close. </p>\n\n<p>I began walking back to the bedroom without switching on any lights that might disturb the sleep cycle. Even so, my eye caught the lighted switch in the hallway. Then, upon entering the bedroom, the lighted switch on the electric heater caught my attention. The realization came that if I didn\u2019t jot down the unusual waking experience of noticing/seeing these lights, the recall might drift away in dream like fashion. So, I groped for my flashlight, and realized that I was faced with still another light. </p>\n\n<p>Possibly the awareness of the parade of lights in my nighttime waking moments had been initiated by the dream theme of collecting light. The experience was not particularly pleasant. To eliminate the unpleasantness, I considered the more comforting thought that when we see \u201Cthe light,\u201D we\u2019ve gotten the answer. Conflicting with that idea was a bunch of nighttime scribbles in my dream journal that contained no simple answer about waking as a dream. As the disappointment became clear, I heard a still small voice say, \u201CWonderful.\u201D At hearing the voice, my resulting excitement blocked out whatever was supposed to be so wonderful. </p>\n\n<p>So, I turned off my flashlight to go back to sleep. As I did so, I saw the glow from the digital display of my clock that I had carefully covered so I wouldn't see the light. Agh, more light. I figured that there must be a message here somehow about seeing the light. Next, I realized that I\u2019d forgotten to put in my mouthpiece to avoid nighttime teeth grinding. So, I got up again and had difficulty finding it because the night-time glow built into its container had gone out. </p>\n\n<p>The experience with light was becoming more complicated and difficult to understand. With relief, an idea came to mind from Ralph Blum\u2019s The Book of Runes. He writes of the desire to immerse oneself in the experience of living \u201Cwithout having to evaluate or understand.\u201D With that in mind, I could go back to sleep. </p>\n\n<p>The next day, an old choir friend gave me a call. During the course of our conversation, I told her about my recent dream along with my intention to learn more about experiencing waking life as if it were a dream. She didn't seem to resonate with the topic. Instead, she said, \u201CWell Arthur, you know the first thing God said was \u2018Let there be light.\u2019\u201D She then proceeded to sing a song as a prayer for me that finished with \u201CMay God\u2019s light shine on your face.\u201D She brought our conversation to a close by repeating the last line of the song. </p>\n\n<p>Later, as I sat back and contemplated the call, I realized that not only was the focus on light continuing in my life, but also that I\u2019d been given a heart-felt gift. That gift of a blessing was related to immersing myself in and being conscious of my waking and dreaming experiences. My dream incubation process that had been designed to more fully understand waking as if one is in a dream certainly yielded unexpected results. The results were reminders of a number of factors including: the powerful effect of intention on our dreams and waking; the back-and-forth flow of information and emotions between dreams and waking; how the mystery of light is alive and well; the question about which comes first, the dream or the waking and finally, the un-predictability of life, the energy drain that can occur when trying to understand things, and the fact that there just aren\u2019t any simple answers. Possibly most important, however, was the reminder that by immersing ourselves in life\u2014and \u2018The Light,\u2019 we can experience satisfaction and a fullness that no amount of understanding can bring. \u2118</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zffelt> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><!--nopreview--><h2>The birth of my new dream-inspired song</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>\n\n<p>This song and the fact that I chose to record it are inspired by a number of dreams. I have experienced many dreams spread over a couple decades that encourage me to record and share more music. Many such dreams involve various famous musical artists. These come at least monthly, sometimes weekly, and occasionally more often. I am lucky to be amongst the tiny percentage of people whose dreams include music and sound. </p>\n\n<p>My newly released song <em>\u201CLucid (Never Felt As Good)\u201D</em> was originally inspired by a music-only dream where I \u201Creceived\u201D the lyrics and melody from the song\u2019s opening line and chorus. Just before I awaken, I clearly hear a disembodied voice singing, <em>\u201CWherever I\u2019ve been in my life, I\u2019ve never felt as good as when I\u2019m with you.\u201D</em> This type of dream melody with lyrics is not unusual for me, but I liked the tune and decided to experiment with it on guitar. Within a few weeks, I composed more lyrics and created a chord pattern and song structure around the dream melody. That was the easy part. </p>\n\n<p>Then came another dream, again music only: <em>I hear the last few notes of the song\u2019s guitar solo bridge as a distorted electric guitar.</em> Again no visuals, but what seems to me a clear suggestion from the muse to switch the feel from acoustic/folk to more rock and roll, especially for the solo. The sound of the electric guitar solo in the recording is much like I heard it in the dream. I recorded the song with friends but the quality was low. Dreams urged me to again record more music and I decided to revisit this song since I felt it was kind of catchy. The recording-arranging process spread over 10 months. In that time, I had multiple dreams encouraging me to continue recording and arranging it. Towards the end of arranging, I had a breakthrough evening where I found the sound I was looking for. I went to sleep very late, but happy. In the morning, I had what felt like a celebration dream: </p>\n\n<p>*A spiritual teacher of mine is strolling along the red carpet. Waking, the dream feels related to the song. *</p>\n\n<p>A week or so later, when I was having trouble blending the mix, another dream came: </p>\n\n<p><em>I\u2019m with my sister at the breakfast table, listening to the current mix with her. It seems that the mixing process is dragging on far too long on the last few notes. I am also shocked to hear that the drums and guitar arrangement has been changed and now sounds quite heavy metal, though it sounds good in an unusual way. At that point, I decide not to change the arrangement any further.</em></p>\n\n<p>Within a couple weeks of completing the recording, Grace has blessed this song with air play on about 150 radio stations so far and I am very grateful. </p>\n\n<p>Among other music I\u2019ve composed, dreams also inspired the recording of my fun environmental song Polymers: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU</a></p>\n\n<p>Life has now blessed me with well over a thousand lucid dreams, so to share some of the dream and lucidity skills and insights that have come my way, I lead lively online interactive teleclasses about how to harvest dreams for creativity (music, art, inventions, film etc.), healing, life path guidance, spiritual growth, adventure, etc. \u2118 </p>\n\n<p>~ ~ \u221E ~ \u221E ~ \u221E ~ ~ </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dreams.ca/teleclass.pdf\">www.dreams.ca/teleclass.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Email: Craig Sim Webb csw@edutainer.ca </p>\n\n<p>Link to song: <a href=\"http://www.edutainer.ca/music/lucidsong.htm\">www.edutainer.ca/lucidsong.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>(song also available at iTunes and Amazon) </p>\n\n<p>Web site: <a href=\"http://www.edutainer.ca/\">www.edutainer.ca</a></p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3ossa> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>By way of introduction, may I share two of the dreams/experiences that compelled me onto this path, an abbreviated dream autobiography. It is, of course, an ongoing adventure.</p>\n\n<p>The event that marked my starting point appeared in the form of a technicolor, stereophonic sound, full length movie-like dream which was the first of its kind in my experience. Its power and beauty were such that I recorded it, not knowing why at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Many other dreams followed, compelling enough that I started journaling regularly and began reading what related literature I could find. But it wasn't until that particular dream took the form of an actual event several years later that I got deeply involved.</p>\n\n<p>This dream occurred during summer 1975 and in it,</p>\n\n<p><em>I find myself in a community center (which in waking life housed the office in which I was working). In every room of this building are people participating in an amazing variety of artistic activities: dancers, singers, musicians, artists...</em></p>\n\n<p>The energy in the dream and afterward was exhilarating!</p>\n\n<p>In the Autumn of l980, the mayor of my community, in his weekly column in the local newspaper, cast an open invitation for \"someone\" in the community to coordinate an event. I considered accepting that invitation by calling together a group of colleagues to brainstorm ideas and as that process was unfolding, ideas and images were being put forth from members of the group which formed in my mind's eye a clear memory of the above-mentioned dream. To the group I exclaimed \"My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!\" One person responded immediately: \"Then we've got to do it!\"</p>\n\n<p>The program was scheduled, very well attended... and I found myself presiding over a virtual re-enactment of the dream in full detail. It was the ever-sought-after experience of Being at the intersection between the dreamworld and daytime 'reality.' The occasion for this event was the 35th anniversary of the United Nations.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the photo (above) was taken during that event:</p>\n\n<p>A Dream Come True! Can you tell?</p>\n\n<p><em>\"To live mythically is to seek guidance from your dreams, imagination, and other reflections of your inner being, as well as from the most inspiring people, practices, and institutions of your society.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>To live mythically is also to cultivate an ever-deepening relationship with the universe and its great mysteries.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>David Feinstein &amp; Stanley Krippner, Personal Mythology</p>\n\n<p>(Jeremy Tarcher, LA CA 1988 ) p. 1</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfdont> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><em>What? The president of an international dream association is telling us not to interpret our dreams? Banish him to the tower immediately!</em></p>\n\n<p>Wait! Let me explain. </p>\n\n<p>When referring to dreamwork, I have trouble with the term, \u201Cinterpretation,\u201D as it implies determination of a finite \u201Cmeaning\u201D and we all know dreams carry multiple meanings. I don\u2019t think the purpose of dreamwork is interpretation, but many people come to dream groups expecting their dream to be \u201Cinterpreted,\u201D suggesting that there is just one explanation for the dream \u2013 and that the dream is meant just for them. </p>\n\n<p>In an open dream group I led in Asheville, North Carolina people dropped in and shared dreams that amazed and perplexed them. Of course the next words out of their mouths were, \u201CWhat does it mean?\u201D The group would spend the next hour or so laboriously \u201Cworking\u201D each dream and the dreamer usually left with some degree of satisfaction in regard to what the dream was about. That was the conclusion of their experience. </p>\n\n<p>Most of these people had little interest in learning how to work on their own dreams such as starting a journal or studying their dream history. They represent many who have dreams that pique their curiosity, but would prefer others to tell them what they mean. Some are even willing to pay a few dollars to an \u201Cexpert\u201D or skim through a dream dictionary to gain insight. </p>\n\n<p>When doing dreamwork, I prefer the term, \u201Cexploration.\u201D I see our roles as dream facilitators or group members as ones who explore a dream in an effort to help the dreamer attain self-discovery. In group settings, exploration is magnified and multiplied. When shared, one person\u2019s dream does not belong to that person alone but takes on its own life within each member of the group.</p>\n\n<p>I tell my groups that a dream is brand new when it occurs in sleep and is again brand new when it is told. Each person hearing it is creating a version of the dream and it is no longer one dream, but many. In other words there is a new dream being dreamed at that moment by each person in the room as well as each person in their families, co-workers or social network friends \u2013 and each one grows from the insight of the one dream captured by one person. </p>\n\n<p>In effect, we are not interpreting a dream, but we are opening up multitudes of possibilities for the dreamers exposed to it. I don\u2019t call my groups dream analysis or dream interpretation groups, but rather dream study groups. We study. We explore. We experience the dream. And we each benefit from that experience. </p>\n\n<p>Every person who hears a dream becomes a facilitator; one who serves the dreamer by listening and attempting to understand the aspects of the dream without projecting or \u201Cinterpreting\u201D it for the dreamer. During the process the veils of confusion are removed and both the dreamer and the facilitator begin to appreciate the blessings the dream has to offer. </p>\n\n<p>To avoid projection and the danger of \u201Ctelling\u201D someone what a dream means when providing personal insight, many dreamworkers begin with the phrase, \u201CIf this were my dream....\u201D That is, if this were my dream it would have this or that meaning or this symbol would mean such and such to me. In order to totally avoid the possibility of projection I prefer, \u201CIn my version of the dream \u2026\u201D By saying this, I take ownership of the dream and am less likely to project based on prior knowledge I may have of the dreamer. In this respect I am more likely to deal solely with the dream itself. </p>\n\n<p>During a dinner party in my home, a woman at the table told an incredible dream about sheep. When she was done, everyone looked at me, as if they expected me to immediately know what the dream \u201Cmeant.\u201D Knowing my in-depth involvement with dreams, they expected me to be an \u201Cexpert.\u201D I told them I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what that dream meant. I took solace remembering an incident Robbie Bosnak wrote about in his book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>. As I recall, after a client of his told a dream, he broke into a cold sweat acknowledging to himself that he didn\u2019t have any idea what it meant. I felt comforted knowing that this man, who does dreamwork for a living, goes through the same anxiety I do when expected to \u201Cinterpret\u201D a dream. </p>\n\n<p>When first told, the dream is a mystery. Its meaning is as unknown to the listener as it is to the dreamer. But as we venture into that unknown, peeling away layer after layer, examining the details, identifying the characters and action sequences of the story - exploring deeper and deeper - the messages the dream is attempting to convey become apparent. For instance, as I delve into a dream about a bear invading my camping space, I may see it as asking me to think about how I deal with conflict or potential conflict, what choices I am making (such as facing fear or running away) or simply how I deal with unexpected consequences. Perhaps all are true. Ultimately, I come to realize there is no fi nite meaning, but infi nite possibilities. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of using the terms dream interpretation or analysis, I support exploration. By steering away from what a dream \u201Cmeans,\u201D (since all dreams have multiple meanings), we can embrace what the dream is asking us to do - to face the critical issues in our lives so we can advance and grow. They ask us the questions we need to address, and rather than giving us direct answers, they guide us to the next question. If we just decide, \u201Cthis dream means this or that,\u201D we are likely to just say, \u201CSince I know what that dream means, I don\u2019t need to explore it any further,\u201D and we fail to experience the full richness of the dream. </p>\n\n<p>Analysis leads to knowledge. True wisdom comes from being in a space of \u201Cnot knowing.\u201D \u2118 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201CNot knowing is true knowing. One knows truly only when one has the wisdom of emptiness. Wisdom is then limitless.\u201D <em>Chan Master Sheng Yen</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>~ ~ \u221E ~ \u221E ~ \u221E ~ ~ </p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfwhat> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Whenever I am getting ready for a radio interview or a talk, I try to anticipate the questions. I usually get questions like \u2026 How can I remember my dreams? Do dreams answer questions? Do they foretell the future? What does the dream I had last night \u201Cmean?\u201D </p>\n\n<p>But on this particular talk show, I was thrown off a bit. The kind lady on the phone handed me a really simple, basic question. But it caused me to hesitate. To think a bit. </p>\n\n<p>Her question: <strong>What is a dream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I thought back. Had any of the so called dream \u201Cexperts\u201D answered that question? I have noticed that most writers of dream books dive right in, assuming everyone knows what they are talking about when they discuss dreams. </p>\n\n<p>The question is definitely worthy of a thoughtful answer. So here is my take on it. My response draws on my understanding of ancient wisdom and eastern philosophy. Our personalities have three aspects: the physical, the emotional, and the mental. The brain is part of the physical aspect. When we die, the physical aspect ceases to exist, but for some time we continue to experience emotion and retain our mental capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>When we dream, we are experiencing a state of consciousness similar to death. Our physical senses are shut down, but our emotional and mental aspects are running full steam. Dream researchers tell us the brain is still functioning during dream periods. The motor and emotional areas of the brain are highly active, enabling us to actually \u201Cexperience\u201D the dream. But I think the dream is less a function of the physical brain than it is of the mind, an aspect of ourselves that transcends the physical. </p>\n\n<p>In the dream state we are free from the distractions of waking life. Free from our day-to-day concerns. I compare it to the Hubble telescope. Scientists knew that to fully experience the universe they had to free themselves from the bounds of earthly atmospheric distractions. In the dream state you can experience whatever happens to you without thought of prejudice, of what it will cost, of who is watching you, of what will happen if you fail. Here your mind receives objective information. Even better, in the dream state you are connected to universal consciousness. You are able to see all the universe has to offer. Your dream is what you see in your Hubble telescope. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What <em>is</em> a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information. A dream is what you would be thinking about if you weren\u2019t so busy working, or buying things, or paying bills, or worrying, or seeking pleasure. </p>\n\n<p>As you sleep, at the end of a day of working, buying things, paying bills, worrying, seeking pleasure, whatever \u2026 your mind processes these events and all the emotions associated with them. It considers them in relation to all that you are and all that you could be. Your mind selects a theme\u2014an essential issue, idea, or perception\u2014 that your need brought to your consciousness at this point in your life. Your mind then attempts to present this theme in a form you can understand. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us are accustomed to the narrative, storybook form. So, for most of us, the mind attempts to tell us a story. This story presents the issues you need to deal with in your waking life. These issues are normally things you know about but are avoiding or afraid to face. They may be things of which you are not yet conscious. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, not everyone processes things in this narrative sense. For instance, artists may just experience visual images, with no storyline at all. </p>\n\n<p>We are told that Billy Joel and Sting are given their musical inspiration in the dream state. I know a potter in Virginia who first \u201Csees\u201D her new projects in dreams. Artists, scientists, and other visionaries often experience ideas, perceptions, and new perspectives in their dreams. </p>\n\n<p>At the point of waking from your dream, you have choices about what to do with your new-found objective information. You can ignore it and say, \u201CIt was just a dream.\u201D Or you can act on this profound message that has come to move you forward, to take you to a new level of understanding about yourself and your world, to give you new insight into your skills and abilities and what you can produce. Someone said, \u201CWe cannot discover new oceans unless we have the courage to lose sight of the shore.\u201D Dreams are asking you to be brave, to take a step forward into new adventures. They are asking you to explore the mystery. </p>\n\n<p>True, they are normally filled with complicated symbolism. True, they are normally asking us to consider some degree of change in our lives. These concerns do not have to stop you in your tracks. I believe the quickest and best way to get past these hurdles is to seek out the core messages\u2014the themes\u2014our dreams are asking us to explore. </p>\n\n<p>Consider a recent dream you have had. Ask yourself, what is the theme of this dream? Generally, did it deal with how you differentiate yourself from others, or how you express yourself, or how you interact with others, or how you capitalize on your experience? Think in terms of broad issues. For example, in the dream, did you experience need, vulnerability, success, failure, exploration, new discovery, adaptability, sharing, love, desire? Were you threatened or criticized? Did you have trouble communicating or applying your knowledge and skills? Did you feel out of control or restricted in some way? Were you surprised to learn there was some new world to explore or some new direction your work can take? </p>\n\n<p>These are all common themes in dreams. But your specific dream is not \u201Ccommon.\u201D It deals with you and your life. Ask yourself where in your waking life you are experiencing these issues or feelings or activities. Finally, look back at the details of the dream to see if it contains new information or clues about how to deal with waking life issues or how to develop and present new ideas or perceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information from deep within you and from the universe around you. It is coming to help you grow. To find your role in the world. To be the best you can be. To be free and to be whole. Honor it by acting on the specific message it is asking you to address. </p>\n\n<p>For more information on themes and how to work with them in your daily dream work, I provide general information on my website, <a href=\"www.heartofthedream.com\">www.heartofthedream.com</a>, and more detailed information in my book, Dream Exploration: A New Approach. \u2118</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfcybr> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><em>A taste of Cyberspace for those wondering what's going on with dreaming and Internet</em></p>\n\n<p>If you haven't been online yet, your first experience might be something like walking into a surprise party. Everyone wants your attention and many will share your same interests, no matter how off-beat. I know that Al Gore talks about the \"Information Super-highway\" (1) and everyone gets excited about how much data is available but the real surprises online are the people. This human connection exists at several levels, from casual and committed one on one relationships, to global community connectivity and activism. As might be expected, these levels of relationship hold true for dream concerned individuals and groups as well. </p>\n\n<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>\n\n<p>Originally designed as ARPA Net by the U.S. Defense Department in the late 1960's to protect political telecommunications in case of an atomic war, the net was a series of four computers that all shared &amp; exchanged the same information. By 1971 it had attracted the attention of the universities and there were 21 host computers, but no one was sure what the common language was going to be between all these computers. By 1982, the decision was made (TCP/ IP), and by 1986 there were 5,000 host computers , mostly at universities and government offices and all able to talk the same language and share the same information. By 1989, the Internet hit the public and media and there were 100,000 host computers. The last figure I heard for 1995 was that the Net had reached 5 million computers. (2)</p>\n\n<p>To be connected to the internet, all one has to have now is a computer, a modem, some Internet software and an account with an Internet Service Provider. If you don't have a free university or government account, there are a multitude of providers and most now give you all the software you need when you sign up with them. The average cost ranges from $10 - $25 per month. The number of people using the Internet is already uncountable, but to give you a tool by which to guess the near future , I want to paraphrase Bill Clinton's October 1995 directive: \"By the year 2000, all U.S. schools K-12 will be connected.\" (3) What will we and our children have access to when we start a computer net search for \"Dreams\"?</p>\n\n<h2>Dreaming in Cyberspace</h2>\n\n<p>To answer that question, it is important to know the distinction between the Internet and Cyberspace. The Internet is a more technical term, the way we connect with one another in computer mediated communications. Cyberspace is the place where this all happens. And there are several kinds of platforms or venues in Cyberspace that dream concerned individuals use. The most popular are E-mail, World Wide Web (WWW) and Usenet.</p>\n\n<h2>Usenet, IRC and Chatrooms</h2>\n\n<p>Usenet is a group of electronic discussion boards started in 1979 to discuss various university curriculum topics, but since that time Usenet has exploded into hundreds of topic from saving the rainforests to chat about the latest episode of the X-files. Like a real bulletin board, one can post messages, read other's messages and leave replies. The first dream bulletin board (alt.dreams) went up just a couple years ago and allows individuals to post dreams and dream related issues as well as making comments on the posts that go up. Some people want advice on how to recall dreams, some want their dreams interpreted, some want to start small online dreamsharing groups. The level of discussion is very uneven and the board is predominately used as a way for people new to dreaming online to ask questions and get connected with more serious projects. But I'm hoping in the near future to include on alt.dreams discussions on dream theory, dream research and the wide array of techniques used by dreamworkers. Also I see alt.dreams as an excellent venue for networking local and regional dream groups, distributing news and developing mutually supportive projects. </p>\n\n<p>In the last year, two more dream related Usenet groups have appeared. The first is alt.dreams.lucid, a discussion board just for lucid dreaming issues, and alt.dreams.Castaneda, which discusses all of the Castaneda issues, but seems most invigorated by the variations on lucid dreaming that are being practiced. Other newsgroups such as alt.psychology.Jung and talk.religion.new age will occasionally discuss dreams in light of their own particular viewpoints. </p>\n\n<p>A spin-off of the newsgroups are the real time internet Relay Chat channels. On the IRC channels you can enter one of hundreds of ongoing real time discussions, simply by typing in a sentence or two and sending it to a screen where others in the room are also sending sentences. Or you can create you own rooms, invite your friends or associates or wait for visitors. Complex interactions and threads can take place but generally the quality is usually lower than on Usenet. There are exceptions. These Chat rooms are also available on most commercial online servers and Fred Olsen has been doing dream reentry work on both Genie and AOL. His directed questions style works quite well in this real time mode. Another notable exception is the Dream Studio, which Donna Campos opens on Mondays nights at 6:00 PM EST on Compuserve. She invites a different guest each week to discuss a variety of dream topics. The key to these chat channels seems to be having a host or guiding moderator.</p>\n\n<h2>The World Wide Web (WWW): Internet Gets a Friendly Face</h2>\n\n<p>In 1990, a couple of CERN physicists in Switzerland were given the task of developing a network that could be used by a variety of international physicists. What they came up with was the World Wide Web, a system that could go out on the Net and use any resource. In 1993, Marc Andreessen gave this route a friendly face by developing for NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the Univ. of Ill. in Urbana-Champaign) a program called Mosaic browser. He gave Mosaic away to the public for free. By December of 1993, over a thousand browsers a day were being downloaded (taken from the net).</p>\n\n<p>What these browsers do is allow net connected users to travel from one friendly page to another at the click of a mouse. These friend ly pages, or web sites (collections of pages), run about $10.00 to $30.00 a month to put up commercially and are free to many university students. What do people put on these pages? Everything! Pictures of themselves and their kids, one's life story, all the things you want to sell, and links that let you jump to other sites, your friends' sites, your business site, similar interest sites. And so, of course, we all put the dreams and dream information we want other people to know about on our web pages.</p>\n\n<p>There are now dozens of Web sites that include information on dreams and dreaming. Dream Network Journal has as site, Electric Dreams has a site, and even ASD and the Lucidity Institute Inc., have sites. A good place to start browsing is a directory of many (not all) dream sites on Yahoo web directory. I've also made available a file called Dream Guide to the Internet which covers most of the sites and how dreaming is represented online. (4) </p>\n\n<p>There are also several dream sharing sites now on the Web. The most interactive and sophisticated at this time is Dream Link. At Dream Link, you can not only finds lots of information about dreams, but actually participate in interactive dreams sharing. It works kind of like a specialized bulletin board. You go to the site with a Web browser and leave your dream and information about your dream. Linton and Becky Hutchison distribute your dream to their network and put both your dream and comments on the dream back up on one of their web pages. The future of the Internet is to be found in the Web. The now static pages will give way to real time video channels and more Interactive forums. But at this time, the one thing you can't get on your Web browser is electronic mail, and e-mail rules the Internet.</p>\n\n<h2>E-mail, E-zines and Mail Lists.</h2>\n\n<p>In early 1993 when the Web was still more of a great idea than a reality, if you wanted to connect with someone on more than a superficial level you used email. We still do. E-mail is like a regular letter except that it's cheaper and faster. I can send a ten page letter from my home in San Francisco to my friends in Australia for about 3 cents. And it gets there in minutes. (Of course, they are probably asleep and won't read and reply for several hours!) What is even better, I can make a copy of that letter and send it to everyone I have-ever met in Cyberspace with an Internet e-mail address (say about a thousand addresses) for the same 3 cents. If I did this, I would probably get 999 letters back, each costing me 3 cents, telling me to knock it off and please send only relevant, personal letters - but I think the point is clear. </p>\n\n<p>E-mail mini-dream groups are easy to start and inexpensive to maintain. They have sprung up all over the globe. Usually with a dozen or less participants, email groups share dreams and comments about each other's dreams. They may last a week, or become a permanent group of friends. </p>\n\n<p>In August of 1993, I found one such community that had grown to about 30 members and put out every couple of weeks a magazine, (or e-zine) Electric Dreams. Originally the community used the e-zine to distribute dreams and comments on the dreams from previous issues. But the members wanted to cut down on the 2 week time lag between dreams and comments. The solutjon was to have the dreams distributed to those interested in commenting so that dreams and comments would be printed together every week or two. </p>\n\n<p>These dreamsharings were certainly not the same as off-line or face-to-face groups, but I felt very excited about the process and felt there was a great networking potential in sharing dreams on a global scale. I had recently been impressed with the networking style of Jill Gregory, the director of the Novato Center for Dreams. Through a variety of news bulletins, dream groups and other interpersonal projects, the dreamers in the Bay area maintain a creative personal community, while at the same time staying in contact with the international dream community. I wanted to model this regional approach on a global scale and added news, projects and other forums to the Electric Dreams community - but the core of the process, the dreamsharing, still needed some anchoring. </p>\n\n<p>Early in 1995 I found an online model for dreamsharing. John Herbert had been running a variation of Montague Ullman style groups on the America Online (AOL) Seniornet. John had also run these groups earlier on local Bulletin Boards or BBS and compared them to face-to-face groups. (5) These BBS are local computer networks that allow people to dial up and participate in various activities, from getting software to playing games, to doing genealogical research. He would have the participants work on one dream at a time, first asking clarification questions, then making comments in the Ullman \"if this were my dream...\" style. At each step, the dreamer had a chance to respond if he or she wished. Now on AOL, John uses a similar bulletin board style, and participants can anonymously post dreams and comments within the mediated process. His preliminary research indicates that the online groups provide as much or more insight than face-to-face groups. Generally he attributes this to the reflective, unpressured time that dreamer and respondents have to make comments. </p>\n\n<p>I took this process back to the Electric Dreams community, modified it for e-mail and have been trying out variations for about a year. The first were round-robins, where we had one file and a list of participants. The file was passed around with the next addresses of where to send the file. As the growing file passed through the mediator and dreamer, the next phase was enacted; from dream presentation, to clarification questions, to replies and comments. It was an administrative nightmare. We switched to a process suggested by Jay Vinton to simply have everyone maintain the group list and send each comment or reply to everyone else on the list. This has worked pretty well and if the continually positive and enthusiastic comments received from the dreamers at the end of the process continue, the two week group mail list will become a permanent fixture to the Electric Dreams community.</p>\n\n<p>The two week Post-and-Comment style dreamsharing is still a part of Electric Dreams and recently I added a special mail list distribution and communication channel to facilitate this. Interested subscribers join the list and can not only submit dreams, but discuss the dreams as well as comments and aspects of dream interpretation in general. Bob Krumhansl pulls all the relevant dialogues, dreams and comments together and we publish them for the whole community every two or three weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Electric Dreams continues to be a kind of eye on Internet for dreamers and a forum for direct dreamsharing, education and news. But even more it is a swarm of mutant butterflies in Cyberspace, a community experimenting with dreamsharing at its core. New forms of dreamsharing appear every week and with the addition of new technologies, even more forms will soon be available.</p>\n\n<h2>Technological Solution or Social Revolution?</h2>\n\n<p>Many people are wary of the Internet and the promises of its being just the latest in a series of 19th and 20th Century technological solutions that end up causing more harm than good. I agree with this caution and feel the Net will probably bring with it more problems than solutions. Just like democracy and Rock &amp; Roll. I'm afraid it is already past the point of trying to pack it up and send it back to National Science Foundation. What we can do is become involved and shape the way that onHne interaction occurs. For example, just as with off-line dreamsharing, on line dreamsharing continues the valuing of inner resourcefulness, of intuitive perception, of supporting each person in being his or her own authority in matters of meaning and value and bringing those out into the community at large.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mean to offer online dreamsharing as better than off-line. I'd rather not set up a feeling of competition here; I personally love the physical embodiments of dream drama and the risky emotional contact and personal closeness of face-to-face meetings. This is just not available at this time on the Net. Rather, I'd like to present online dreamsharing as something new, opening a new niche, a new wavelength that is different from face-to-face dream sharing. Online dreamsharing complements and supports all other kinds of dream sharing through the more specific development of reflective skills and more general global dissemination of the benefits of communiti es tied together through the sharing of dreams. </p>\n\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n\n<p>(1) Gore, Al (1991 Sept.).

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zflast> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><strong><em>\u201CWhen you harm Nature, you harm yourself.\u201D</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I first heard those words nearly twenty years ago, in a dream. They have haunted me ever since. In that equation\u2019s utter simplicity, it seems to me, a deep ecological truth about relationships emerges. </p>\n\n<p>In the dream, <em>I stand on a steep sloping river bank of exposed dirt and mud. A friend and I watch helplessly as a lone figure proceeds to cut down the last standing tree on the desolate river bank. As I observe the final bit of green life lean sharply and tumble to the barren ground, an unspeakable sadness rises within me. At that moment, my friend says solemnly, \u201CWhen you harm Nature, you harm yourself.\u201D</em></p>\n\n<p>On one level, it was ironic to hear these words from my friend, since in waking life, he graduated from the University of Chicago with an MBA and firmly believed in the \u201CChicago School\u201D of economic thought, which held that the free market would provide for everyone\u2019s needs by properly valuing all items, according to the laws of supply and demand. But having canoed with my friend as a Boy Scout, backpacked with him across wilderness mountain passes in Colorado and New Mexico, and sipped cold water from alpine streams, I knew there was another side of him that valued the beauty and great harmony of nature. </p>\n\n<p>As an adult, I tried to discover what economic value he and the Chicago School\u2019s free market system placed on nature. What was the value of a healthy environment? What was the value of a well functioning ecosystem? How did this economic approach calculate global sustainability? Like many discussions with economists at that time, I found that a properly functioning ecosystem seemed a \u201Cgiven.\u201D We did not have to be concerned about it; the natural world had been built into the equation as an economic assumption. </p>\n\n<p>Yet in this dream, my friend provides an answer with a new and startling economic equation devoid of assumptions and givens. <em>When you harm Nature, you harm yourself</em>. Suddenly the fundamental economic principle of the environment seemed clear: When you deplete nature, you deplete yourself. When you hamper nature, you hamper yourself. When you threaten the proper functioning of nature, you directly threaten yourself. Subtracting from nature, subtracts from you. Enhancing nature, enhances you. Economically and quite practically, my dreamt equation made explicit what economic equations do not: our individual and collective well being is intrinsically connected to Nature\u2019s micro and macro well-being. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhere in history, modern man began ignoring that direct connection with physical nature. Similarly, the rarefied world of economic thought and philosophy dismissed it too. Yet the deeper, archaic, unconscious part of my self, accessible in dreams, still carried the knowledge of this ancient economic equation. A subconscious portion of me knew what had been tragically learned on Easter Island and elsewhere: <em>\u201CWhen you harm Nature, you harm yourself.\u201D</em> </p>\n\n<p>In dreaming, we possess a connection to this older and wiser portion of our being, which can remind us of ancient truths and guide us to creative realizations and actions\u2014if we do not ignore it. In the final chapter of my recently released book, <strong>Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</strong>, I relate an interesting dream in which <em>a tall, regally dressed man stopped me and asked me a simple question, \u201CWhat book do you hold in your hand?\u201D Unsure, I brought the book in front of me and read the title, \u201CDreams: God\u2019s Forgotten Language by John A. Sanford.\u201D Then suddenly, it dawned on me that I had this book on my book shelf but had never read it. I became lucidly aware... ecstatic.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Upon waking, I pondered the idea that the unconscious portion of my larger self had knowingly and purposefully called this book to my attention as important. But why? In the book\u2019s final chapter, \u201CThe God Within,\u201D I find one of the possible answers in Sanford\u2019s conclusion: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201CWe are not only conscious; we are also unconscious. Unconscious psychic reality is as real and substantial as is our conscious life. It expresses its reality in a hundred ways, one of which is the dream. The center of our conscious life is the ego, the center of our total psyche is the self, which seeks to express through our consciousness the totality of our nature.\u201D </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By attending to our dreams, we have one means to attend to \u201Cthe totality of our nature.\u201D Without the connection to dreams, we can easily forget and ignore our broader nature and become trapped in an ego-centric and finite world. </p>\n\n<p>With Sanford\u2019s perspective, the wider circle of interrelationships becomes apparent. Not only, \u201CWhen we harm Nature, [do] we harm ourself,\u201D but when we ignore and deny the unconscious, we lessen ourselves. We lose touch with our inner nature. It is our inner nature that reminds us of our ancient connections to Nature, others and the larger self\u2014the broad circle of being. The gift of dreaming is the gift of that connection. Through honoring that connection, we can find a way. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>When you love Nature, you love yourself.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>\u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfbigd> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Do you ever wish you could have a really <em>BIG DREAM?</em> You might imagine what it would be like: a great opportunity. Some people report having life defining dreams that remain vividly in mind for years. </p>\n\n<p>Who wouldn\u2019t want such an experience? In ones\u2019 imagination, the <em>big dream</em> might be extremely vibrant, or be of the utmost clarity. Most certainly, it would be memorable and life changing. The dream might spark a spiritual awakening. </p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to find out more about the big dream, I looked through my dream book collection. Some of the authors assured readers that their books on dreams provided all the information they needed to know about dreams. Nevertheless, scanning tables of contents, chapter titles, section labels, and indices failed to turn up any direct reference to the big dream. </p>\n\n<p>The big dream was even elusive on the internet. The term was there. Some \u201Cbig dream\u201D sites attempted to tell internet surfers what they \u201Creally\u201D want out of life. One site had a synchronicity card pack for sale. Another site was about a church building fund. Even \u201Cbigdream.com\u201D billed as \u201Cyour source for virtually anything\u201D wasn\u2019t a source of information about big dreams. On a hunch, I revisited The World Dream Book by Sarvananda Bluestone. He used the term, \u201Cgreat dream.\u201D He also provided a simple yet significant reminder that \u201C \u2026 there are many kinds of dreams, it lies with the dreamer to determine the nature of the dream and it remains for each person to determine his dreams\u2019 lessons.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>There is certainly the chance that many of us have had a big dream and failed to recognize it. We\u2019ve been conditioned in our society to expect important things to make a big impression. The big dream may fail to get our full attention at first. </p>\n\n<p>Symbolically, the International Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) has been like a big dream for me that began quietly but grew in importance as I worked with it. It has helped me to satisfy my intention to learn more about dreams by providing reading material, group study opportunities, dream sharing groups, and research reports. Most importantly, it has provided the opportunity to be a part of a dedicated community of dreamers. Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell are vital members of that community. </p>\n\n<p>I met Rita when I attended an Association for the Study of Dreams annual conference for the first time. Prior to the conference, I had little contact with the organization. Rita made quite a fuss over me. She explained how she had seen my name as a founding member of the association on paperwork for about 14 years and wondered who this phantom person might be. Her welcome made me feel very much at home during a personally and professionally rough time in my life. Immediately after the conference, I got to enjoy her company when a small group of members went out to supper before returning home. Remembering the event brought a heartfelt smile as I recalled such a warm feeling of belonging. Over time, I became aware of how vitally important Rita was to the association and all of the people she has welcomed. Years later, at another conference, I was just turning to leave the ball, when Rita reached out and asked me to dance. I wondered if she had sensed that I felt alone and reached out once again to make me feel right at home. </p>\n\n<p>I met Jean Campbell at an ASD Conference in Copenhagen a few years ago. I knew about her marvelous \u201CDream Bridge\u201D project that allowed children from different countries to share their dreams. I can recall with fondness, sitting on a restaurant boat with Jean and another member as Jean shared her dreams, plans, and hopes for the organization. The weather was chilly and rainy, but she projected an air of confidentiality that made me feel like a life long friend. At a subsequent conference, I was pleased to learn that she had been elected as president of the association and I worked just briefly with her on a project. More recently, I received a note card from Jean in the mail. She was complementing me on an article I had written. I was tickled to read the compliment in her beautifully written script even before I had gotten a chance to see the article in print myself. </p>\n\n<p>Like dream characters, Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell came into my life for an admittedly brief period of time, but have had an ongoing and meaningful effect. In order to fully appreciate the positive impact these two dedicated individuals have had on the lives of others, however, we would literally have to visit with people all over the world. You can bet that Rita and Jean represent portions of the big dreams of many individuals. So, if you get a chance to meet Rita and Jean, be sure to see that opportunity as potentially life changing, something like a big dream coming your way. \u221E</p>\n\n<p><em>Bluestone, Sarvananda.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zmcat1> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Dreams are a very important aspect of our daily lives that need more conscious attention and consideration. Whether we dream in vague snippets or full-blown epic movies, the information your sleeping mind is sharing should not be overlooked. With more focus and value given to your dreams, you will remember more dreams and learn incomparable lessons. </p>\n\n<p>I have found that dreams can fall into ten different categories. When approaching dreams, know that several categories may apply to one dream. The deeper you explore, the more levels of meaning you can find. I present these categories so that you may begin to look at your own dreams to discover the multidimensional aspects within these nightly scenarios. </p>\n\n<h2>1. Daily Wash or Review Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>These are the most common of dreams and, unfortunately, are often easily dismissed. An example might be: you have dinner with a friend and that night you dream about having dinner with this friend. In the dream, you have all the food on your side of the table as your friends sits there watching you eat. Suddenly, she begins crying uncontrollably. Then, as you watch, she turns into a small, wounded bird fluttering on the chair, seeming to cry out for attention. You are then changed in to a colorful parrot talking a mile a minute. There are several possible reasons for having this type of dream: </p>\n\n<p>a) The dream might be showing you explicitly the choices you made. With the food on your side of the table, you become aware that you were the one nourished through your encounter with your friend.</p>\n\n<p>b) The dream might be sharing reactions you overlooked. Your subconscious picks up on subtle emotional nuances and presents them to you in the dream. Your friend was upset and you were not consciously aware of this, thus your dream presents her emotional state in a dramatic version so that you will listen. </p>\n\n<p>c) A third reason for this type of dream might be to act as a character study. Through these bird symbols, you clearly understand each of your roles from the previous evening. In a waking state you can now correct the imbalances from your dinner by calling to listen, support and nourish your friend. Rather than quickly tossing these dream images aside, look more closely into the messages behind dreams. Please don't dismiss any dream fragments or \"obvious\" messages; dreams are more complex and deserve your attention. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Character Review Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Most characters presented in dreams are an aspect of yourself. When you dream about your mother she is likely to be personifying an aspect of yourself of which you may not be aware. When friends from the past pop up in a dream, you should look back either to your relationship with them or the time period you knew them to see what messages they present. The \"character review\" category can serve several functions: </p>\n\n<p>a) It can highlight your own strengths. Perhaps your dream shows positive aspects about yourself that you are presently overlooking. For example, you dream about a beautiful dancer being showered with roses upon her curtain call. She then presents the roses to you backstage. The dream is showing your potential for sharing creativity with others and being rewarded. However, consciously you have put these talents \"backstage\" and the dream is showing you the rewards of bringing them \"on stage\". </p>\n\n<p>b) It can point out weaknesses. You dream about standing in line, then you get stuck in traffic and then your date is late. When you awaken, you see the comedy in this frustrating dream and understand your own need to be patient with circumstances that are out of your control. </p>\n\n<p>c) It can also give suggestions for balancing. You dream about being chained to your desk with mounds of work in front of you. Meanwhile, outside the window, you see people playing. You wake up knowing that \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" and you vow to take more time for yourself. </p>\n\n<h2>3. Problem Solving Dreams.</h2>\n\n<p>Dreams are very helpful, like a good friend trying to relay messages to you... all you have to do is ask. There are several ways these problem solving tools can be used. </p>\n\n<p>a) Dreams can present business or study advice. One night, I gave myself a pre-sleep suggestion about whether to take a job I was considering. That night, I dreamt that I was walking a close, unidentified friend to the elevator in a high rise apartment building. I turned to go back down the hall to my apartment. Suddenly, the elevator cable snapped and I heard the elevator crash to the bottom, my friend screaming. I woke up and immediately knew I shouldn't take this particular job because it could\" crash\" to the ground and in the process I would lose something close to me.</p>\n\n<p>b) Dreams can aid in interpersonal clarification. You are having some misunderstandings with your spouse and you go to bed upset. That night, your dream shows you some key to this conflict, and you awaken with a resolution and a better understanding of your partners feelings. </p>\n\n<p>c) They can give clues for the best choice to be made. Perhaps you are considering moving and have narrowed your choice down to several locations. Still undecided, you go to sleep and you dream about the most appropriate location for you. Dreams may not be presented in a literal scenario, but when working with the symbols of the dream, the deeper meaning becomes much more evident. Listen to your own inner voice or \"heart\" to validate your impressions. As the dreamer, you will know when you've \"gotten\" the message from your dream. </p>\n\n<p>d) Finally, dreams can share suppressed emotions about a situation. In college, my sister and I had many misunderstandings. I dreamt shortly before shew as getting married that her best friend and I completely missed the wedding. We showed up without our bridesmaids' dresses on, embarrassed to be so late. My dream warned me about my negative feelings and how they could potentially sabotage my sister's wedding. </p>\n\n<h2>4. Body &amp; Health Awareness Dreams.</h2>\n\n<p>Dreams can:</p>\n\n<p>a) Show imbalances</p>\n\n<p>b) Give health-aid suggestions</p>\n\n<p>c) Share mental or emotional effects on the body. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you dream about a vicious dog attacking your stomach and ripping out your intestines. Your doctor (or someone you don't actually know in waking life, but this person reminds you of your doctor) appears, leading a cow. You awaken, aware that this stomach pain could be a serious problem, perhaps an ulcer. Your dream shows the importance of making an appointment to see your doctor and that you should drink more milk to soothe your ulceric problems. The dog is showing how your uncontrollable anger, even if suppressed, is the cause of this attack on your stomach and intestines. Dreams are not always presented so simplistically as these examples, and you may not be aware of their meaning upon waking; however, if given attention, dreams will make their meaning clear and relay their individually unique message. </p>\n\n<h2>5. Inspiration Dreams.</h2>\n\n<p>a) Dreams can give specific answers to questions. My brother, a computer scientist, has told me of going to bed exhausted from working on an unsolved issue. In the morning, the solution to the problem is clear! Dreams used for problem solving and inspiration have been greatly noted by a variety of people such as scientists, writers and other artists, and business people. </p>\n\n<p>b) Dreams can show creativity in action. During college, I was taking a choreography class. I took a short nap before rehearsal one day. In my dream, I woke up at 6:10 pm., although the meeting was to begin at 5:00. I dashed over to the studio and everyone had already been working for over an hour. In the dream, we completed the dance and felt very creative. When I woke up, it was indeed 6:10pm. AGH! My partners had left by then without working on our project. The next day, I shared the dance ideas presented in my dream and many of these ideas were incorporated into our final dance project! So my dreams were working on my dance project even though my body was sleeping. </p>\n\n<p>c) Dreams can provide motivation to continue in a specific creative endeavor. As an actress, there are times when I lose sight of my goals. Usually during this time, I will dream of being cast in a great role and I wake up with renewed determination. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(Editor's note: In the next issue, Rosemary will describe the remaining five dream categories she has identified.) </p>\n\n<p>(c) ROSEMARY WATTS</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6kmyth2> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>In <a href=\"../bcpov6kmyth1\">Part 1 of this article</a> (Dream Network, Vol. 17 No. 3), we presented some concepts and techniques you can use to recognize several different types of dreams and to understand what they might be suggesting about the evolution of your personal mythology. In Part II, we will demonstrate how some of these techniques might be applied using as our example a dream report contained in a popular song by The Beatles: \"A Day in the Life.\" But before we begin the dream appreciation, allow us a brief recapitulation of the basic points we covered in the first part of this article. </p>\n\n<p>Our personal mythologies are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>\n\n<p>A mythic crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it. Because dreams appear to synthesize one's existing mythic structures with the data of one's life experiences, any incongruity between these elements is often presented to us in dream content. Indeed, it appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>\n\n<p>Because it is the nature of many dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of beha vior, dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness.</p>\n\n<p>A particular dream may include one or more of the following aspects: The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\n<li>emphasizing past experiences which formerly provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li> \n\n<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth;</li>  \n\n<li>providing glimpses of a future dominated by the old myth-a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.\n\n</li> \n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\n<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner, providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>  \n\n<li>interpreting new experiences in this manner and/ or accommodating the old myth to fit new experiences in a manner that corresponds more closely to the countermyth;</li>  \n\n<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities. While inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or, the dream may facilitate a cognitive-effective integration between the two myths (the previously existing old myth and the new counter-myth). This process is suggested in dreams that:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\n<li>feature experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li> \n\n<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experience and show ways of resolving it; or</li>  \n\n<li>portend a future where the conflict is resolved, often hinting at ways in which the dreamer might accomplish the resolution.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Finally, feeling tone often gives an important clue as to the function of the dream. Old myth dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining. Counter-myth dreams typically have a hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating tone. And integration dreams generally feel calm, positive and realistic. </p>\n\n<p>Now let's take a look at how we might apply some of these concepts to an actual dream report. We're going to assume that the vast majority of our readers are familiar with the Beatles (in fact, we're going to assume that you have a copy of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8\">\"A Day in the Life\"</a> that you can now listen to). As you're listening to the song, notice that you are being led through a dreamscape. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"I read the news today oh boy, About a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad, Well I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A good place to begin is with the feeling tone of the dream (especially in this case, as the music provides us with a very tangible expression of the emotional context). What is the overall emotional sense we get from this dream? The voice is distant; it is detached from the scene being described, which is a tragic car accident. Notice the disconnect between the sadness of the news and the dreamer's reaction \"well I just had to laugh... \" </p>\n\n<p>Leonard Bernstein once reportedly told an interviewer that this song was the most brilliant five minutes of music written since World War II. Indeed, what other piece of music so perfectly captures the strange, self-contained logic of a dream in which even the most unlikely juxtapositions appear to make perfect sense? The next scene is similar to the car accident in that it is a scene of tragedy. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"I saw a film today, oh boy. The English army had just won the war.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Listen to Lennon's intonation of 'oh boy.' The weary boredom in his voice is far removed from the enthusiasm this phrase brings to mind! This stanza seems to be referring to the famous films of the concentration camps made at the end of World War II, truly some of the most horrific film of the century. It isn't surprising that, 'A crowd of people turned away.' For them, it was too terrible to watch. But our anesthetized dreamer doesn't turn away... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"But I just had to look, Having read the book.\"</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here again we have the perfect statement of the dreamer's distance from all that he is witnessing. As in the first scene, his reaction is somehow justified by having experienced an artificial depiction of the event. In the first sequence, he 'just had to laugh' because he'd seen the photograph. In this case, he 'just had to look' because he'd read the book. </p>\n\n<p>At this point, the song takes us into a swirling orchestral tumult which ends with the ringing of an alarm clock. Then, \"Woke up, fell out of bed, Dragged a comb across my head...\" The music has changed completely (as has the voice, from Lennon's to McCartney's). What had been remote and unconcerned is now matter-of-fact and busy. For the rest of this stanza, we are led through the morning ritual: the tea, being late, grabbing the coat and hat, almost missing the bus, having a first cigarette... But then somebody speaks, our guide drifts off into another dream and we are once again in the parallel-world where traffic fatalities can be funny, and war can be nothing more than a curiosity. </p>\n\n<p>What can we conclude about the import of this dream? In terms of the feeling tone, it seems that this is an old myth dream. Both music and voice are voi d of emotion. There is a sense of dissociation from everything being experienced. Even expressions that are used specifically to convey emotion-\"oh boy\"-are delivered utterly empty. </p>\n\n<p>Nothing that we see in the content of the dream suggests that a counter-myth is being offered or strengthened, nor does there seem to be a process of integration taking place. Rather, it seems that our guide is dreaming of daily experiences (the traffic accident involving a member of the House of Lords, corning across a documentary about World War II being shown in a public place) that could easily lead to a challenge to his current personal mythology. But he is apparently not yet ready to generate a counter-myth to replace his old, entrenched myth. This dream seems to be performing the second function of the old myth type: 'resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth.' </p>\n\n<p>And yet, it seems our dreamer is on the cusp of a true crisis in his personal mythology. This crisis is suggested in the vast distance his dream suggests he feels between himself and his experience, as well as by the fact that the assimilation of these experiences seems provisional, at best. It is certainly a forced assimilation when tragedy has become funny, and evidence of extreme human cruelty evokes nothing beyond mild interest. The dream is so inappropriately devoid of emotion, so empty and lonely, that one cannot help but feel that it is a call for help of some kind. Such numbness can only be the result of extreme pain, and the extremity of this pain may presage a breakthrough into a counter-myth scenario, perhaps in another dream. </p>\n\n<p>We hope that this example has been helpful in clarifying a few of the concepts and techniques one can use in dream appreciation. We would welcome other opinions and interpretations concerning this dream report, as well as suggestions of other dream-containing songs that might be used in future articles (please send them to <a href=\"../@chrisryan\">Chris Ryan</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>For further exploration of the concepts and techniques presented in this article, please see The Mythic Path by D.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfpsig> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>It all began in a dream telepathy contest, where strange \u2013 stranger-than-usual \u2013 things happened.</p>\n\n<p>It was 2006, my first year attending the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) annual online PsiberDreaming Conference (PDC), which always includes psi dreaming contests. For this one Beverly D'Urso was \u201Csender,\u201D endeavoring to mentally transmit a target image. We contestants were to post our dreams online; when four pictures were posted we'd each choose which best matched our dream; then judges would select winners with the best \u201Chits.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>On the designated night I took off flying and called out, \u201CBeverly, show me the picture!\u201D I found myself \u201Cflying over a snowy scene.... A stretch of bare soil... a very large dog appeared.... Another smaller, darker dog was with him... possibly rescue dogs.... Suddenly I was indoors looking at and hearing an announcement of the answer... pictures of different types of dogs.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Mary Pat posted her dream just after mine: hers had \u201Creindeer with red leather harnesses... intense cold, rounded hills of snow and ice....\u201D and then, \u201Cthe image of a dog, nothing else, the background dark.... I realized he was a husky....\u201D</p>\n\n<p>At least four others dreamed of snow. Bob dreamed of a snowball fight, then twice of dogs: one on a bed with him, one on the bedroom floor. Val dreamed her parakeet was \u201Cthe size of a large dog\u201D!</p>\n\n<p>When the four picture were posted, surprisingly, none had a dog. But one was a scene of snow and bare ground \u2013 with two elves looking up into pines: a young one in a gray jumpsuit, a scowling older one in a red pointed cap. Had anyone dreamed the elves? </p>\n\n<p>Yes! Sonia's dreams had a boy in a gray jumpsuit; B.A.'s, a boy, then \u201Ca red triangular shape.\u201D Dolores dreamed of two dwarves in pointed red caps. Ilkin got the facial expressions: \u201CGrumbling/curious.... Looking for something.... Snow.\u201D Patricia dreamed of elves sheltering in a tree from a storm; \u201Cthe dog alerts them....\u201D </p>\n\n<p>Some dreamed evergreens and Christmas scenes. It was like putting together a puzzle. Indeed Ed, an experienced psi dreamer, dreamed that he failed to solve a blue and white interlocking puzzle on a white countertop. He correctly took this as a clue that the dreams of snow were better \u201Chits\u201D than his! </p>\n\n<p>We were delighted when Beverly revealed the target: the elves-in-snow. Then she posted her own dreams from her night of \u201Csending,\u201D including this: \u201CExtremely large dog... climbed into this little bed with me. I was saying, 'No, no, no....'\u201D!</p>\n\n<p>So where did all the dogs come from?</p>\n\n<p>Finally Suzanne disclosed that, the same night, she'd also participated in another dream psi experiment. The target? A team of sled dogs in the snow!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-0.jpg\" width=\"300px\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Snow target image with two elves\"></img></p>\n\n<p>Discovering these and other complex interconnections unfolded an extraordinary camaraderie. Kathy posted that she was \u201Cimpressed with the way people are dreaming together \u2013 we seem to have woven a tight fabric of related dreams in the last 24 hours: a harmonious dream song....\u201D </p>\n\n<p>I agreed. \u201CWhat an experience \u2013 tuning into shared dream-space with not only Beverly but, as it turns out, all who participated.... Everybody wins by participating and experiencing our connectedness. There could be no greater reward.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>The judges deliberated an extra day, citing \u201Cthe strange and wonderful things that happened,\u201D then gave ties for first, second and third with a flock of honorable mentions.</p>\n\n<p>I posted, \u201CIt was difficult to evaluate my own dreams' relation to the target without looking at everyone else's. Think how fun and rewarding it would be if that were the object of the game! \u2013 especially if choosing among possible targets as in [this] contest \u2013 treat it as a group dream and say, for instance, \u201CWow, there's a lot of snow in here! \u2026And look at all the elves. I vote #1 is the target.\u201D\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Six years later I helped create just such an event for the 2012 PDC. The Group Remote Viewing Game proved a splendid test of the hypothesis that a group can work together to generate dream clues, then solve a mystery. </p>\n\n<p>But I've told that story elsewhere (IASD's Dream Time magazine). Here, let's play with a less-testable idea: Do people dreaming toward a common goal form something like a group mind? </p>\n\n<p>The target: King Tutankhamun's golden funerary mask. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-1.jpg\" width=\"200px\" height=\"auto\"></img></p>\n\n<p>The dreams: multiple puzzle pieces, including two or more of each of the following: ancient cities, artifacts, the Middle East, rulers, spiritual figures, temples, ceremonies, statues, portraits, boxes, graves, dimly-lit rooms, mummy-like wrappings, gold \u2013 lots of gold. And there were surprising mirrorings in ways dreaming minds interpreted these themes. A few among many oddly intersecting dreams that pointed to the target:</p>\n\n<p>Dale dreamed, \u201CI am traveling to a remote place where I witness some type of ceremony inside a building... possibly a communion.\u201D Jay dreamed \u201Ca single image. A flat smooth shiny green leather case... containing a shiny metal plate (paten) with a single large communion host on it.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Sarcophagus-like, the case holds what many Christians call the body of Christ, considered \u2013 as Egyptians considered the Pharaohs \u2013 both God and man. But why green? Perhaps because Rita was dreaming of a \u201Cmagical/mystical... green box\u201D?</p>\n\n<p>Rita also dreamed of a golden \u201Cstatue of the Mary, the Madonna\u201D while Valley was dreaming of \u201Cthe embodiment of Mary [with] large dark living eyes.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>No one dreamed \u201CEgypt,\u201D but Carol dreamed initials UR and thought of the ancient Mesopotamian city, while Kate dreamed \u201Ca repeating motif of blue and aqua\u201D reminding her of \"the detail work on an ancient frieze from Mesopotamia.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>Kate had apparently zoomed in on the mask's lapis lazuli and turquoise inlays. It also has alternating blue and gold stripes; Sharon dreamed gold stripes on a gold-framed portrait of a revered and famous man, while Ed dreamed blue stripes on the head of a powerful, reclining magician.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's another unscientific notion. When people dream together, does the waking world collaborate?</p>\n\n<p>Maria recounted her experience on the night designated for dreaming the target. \u201CI have a model of Tut's sarcophagus [that] toppled over that evening for no apparent reason, obliging me to take notice of it as I set it right again....\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Carol was deliberating which image best matched the group's dreams when when \u201Cout of nowhere\u201D an acquaintance told her, \u201CMaybe you were a pharaoh's daughter in a past life.... I thought of you last night when I turned on a movie and watched The Mummy Returns!\u201D </p>\n\n<p>When I revealed the target, Kate was listening to a presentation on her iPod. \u201CThe presenter started talking (out of the blue) about Egypt, pharaohs, and how people had said Obama looks like a pharaoh.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>And at that moment Carol heard \u201CWalk Like An Egyptian\u201D on the radio.</p>\n\n<p>A few participants' closing remarks:</p>\n\n<p>Sharon: \u201CSo glad we all did what we did together. It does work....\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Maureen: \u201CIt's nice to feel that the combined vision, the pieces of the puzzle that each dreamer contributed, each in his or her own way \u2013 really made this event work.... I'm very, very impressed with the success of this event and the rich psi content of the dreams....The communal focus felt extraordinary to me.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Laurel, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.: \u201C'We must give an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in our individual societies.' Seems like this game has been an excellent example of a group coming together in this way.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Tony: \u201CIt's been a lot of fun and left me with a very strong feeling of \u2013 what's next!\u201D</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

This means that we can use dream techniques on waking life events or situations. Go ahead. Try it: </p>\n\n<p>Pick something from your everyday, waking life \u2014 say, an unexpected change in your job, or that near-miss on the freeway, or perhaps an emotionally charged encounter with someone \u2014 and take a step back to look at that event or situation \u2018as if\u2019 it were a dream or a scene from a dream. Apply your favorite dream tech-nique(s) to this event or situation. What do you notice? Now take another unusual waking life event or situation and look at that as if it were a dream. Now look at any waking life event or situation as if it were a dream. </p>\n\n<p>How does the dream world show up in your waking life? </p>\n\n<p>How do you know that you are NOT dreaming, right now? </p>\n\n<p>When we work with our dreams, we have tools to enhance our everyday life\u2014and to explore this dream we call \u2018waking life\u2019. </p>\n\n<p>How do you work with dreams? What are your favorite techniques? However you look at dreams, use those tools to look at waking life. See the people, places, actions, emotions, etc. in a waking life event or situation as if it were a dream event or dream fragment. What do you notice? What do you see? What do you learn about yourself in this exercise? What do you learn about your relationship(s)? Your body? Your job? Your life\u2019s calling? Your choices? </p>\n\n<p>In the 1980\u2019s, I spent hours each day/ week recording dreams and working with the dream tools and techniques I was learning. I incubated dream questions, intended lucid dream experiences, wrote about my dreams, read dream books, etc. In short, I immersed myself in the world of dreams and dove deep with the intention of dissolving the culturally-constructed barrier between waking life and dreaming life. Somewhere in all this dreamwork, I began to intentionally look at unusual or out of the ordinary waking life events and situations: a child\u2019s doll, lost/discarded along a wet curb; an argument with a co-worker; found money; odd objects that caught my attention for some reason. What happened \u2018woke me up\u2019 more than I expected! </p>\n\n<p>As anyone who works with dreams knows, the more attention one pays to dreams, the more detailed and vivid they can become. Coupled with a desire to become lucid while awake in consensus reality, this intensive dreamwork began to thin the veil between worlds. My waking life became richer and spoke to me in surprising and personally meaningful ways. My dream life became more alive. Using several methods to remind myself that I was dreaming (while sleeping and while awake), the pre-lucid and lucid dreams became more frequent. Then, one day, the dream-world appeared in waking-life reality\u2014I literally walked into a recurring dream-image! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>That day I went to a particular room I had been to several times before. Nothing was out of the ordinary on \u2018this side\u2019 of the door (no signs or announcements). However, when I opened the door, the room was obviously in the midst of significant remodeling\u2014 spaces that were normally private were completely exposed (!).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This room, this image, came from dreamtime and said, very clearly, <em>\u2018waking and dreaming are one.\u2019</em> The world shifted, expanded, and I knew that if I crossed the thresh-hold and entered that room my life would not\u2014 could not\u2014be the same. I wish I could say I eagerly stepped into the room. What I discovered instead was a strong attachment to my \u2018ordinary\u2019 (albeit uncomfortable) life. In that room, anything/everything was possible... but required more than I was willing to give up. I closed the door without entering the room. </p>\n\n<p>Then the circumstances of my life began to change, leaving less time for intensive dreamwork. I was still connected to my dreams, however, and started my first dream group around that time. </p>\n\n<p>I never quite let go of looking at waking life events and situations \u2018as if\u2019 they were dreams. One eye stayed open for dream images in waking life. I still draw on these concepts in dream groups and workshops. Sometimes I look back on that day, that choice, with the wistfulness of wishing I had been \u2018braver\u2019 at the time. Change continued, as it does, in steps large and small. Something profound had touched me, and although my life seemed safely \u2018ordinary,\u2019 my interest in non-ordinary reality and dreams gave it an unusual flavor. Now, years later, I seek again something like that room, to enter and take that leap, to consciously cross the thresh-hold, and actively embrace a non-ordinary life in which \u2018waking and dreaming are one.\u2019 </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes waking-life dreams are personal, circumstances surrounding a sudden head-dive and broken finger, for example. Even in the emergency room, I joked/talked with my friend, \u201CIf this were a dream, what would it be telling me?\u201D Sometimes a waking dream includes others, as when several of us headed out of town to meet with another dreamworker, the driver had car trouble that stopped us in our tracks. The part(s) that failed held significance on several levels. And sometimes a waking dream is part of the collective psyche, as with Sept. 11 or hurricane Katrina. </p>\n\n<p>Viewing the events and situations of waking life \u2018as if\u2019 they are dreams allows another, larger, dimension to open in our personal/collective world. We are not as separate from ourselves or from each other as some would have us believe. We are not alone and are not powerless in the face of disaster or tragedy. It is possible to see more of one\u2019s self, and the world, with the help of these \u2018waking dreams.\u2019 Working with waking life events as dreams can help each of us become more conscious in our lives. As each person becomes more conscious (in interactions, choices, etc.), the world (and the world view) will, of necessity, change. </p>\n\n<p>We are all connected. Life is a dream \u2013 a great big, collective, group dream. Let us wake up in our dreaming life. Let us wake up in our waking life. </p>\n\n<p>Let us become conscious. Emerge from the cocoon. Let\u2019s wake up. \u2118</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3asay> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Ann used Milton Erickson's common-sense and self hypnosis approach to dreams. She used art, dreams, and closed eye visioning in workshop intensives here and abroad. She taught at Lesley College Arts Institute, where she helped develop the Expressive Therapies Program, trained teachers, and earned her Master\u2019s degree. Ann kept dream journals for fifty years, published two books on dreams, and was an ASD member and presenter for over 20 years, offering workshops and slide talks at IASD (almost every year), and at California\u2019s Esalen Institute, The Cambridge center for Adult Education, and organizations here and abroad. She derived much inspiration from the work of Patricia Garfield, Freud, Jung, Milton Erickson, Gibran, the I Ching, the Dalai Lama, and others.</p>\n\n<p>This adaptation of her Introduction to her last book, Satisfy the Image, summarizes her work: </p>\n\n<p>Autodrama on the Paper Stage is a concrete mapping method that works for dreams and all kinds of life problems. You create your own symbols to represent the people and things in your story and set them on a sheet of paper we call the stage. Instead of telling the story in words, we use colored paper or found objects to represent characters and significant objects\u2014it\u2019s very simple. As you answer questions about the scene, you begin to understand the problem and manipulate the characters in search of resolution. </p>\n\n<p>As a mini psychodrama, it shrinks the stage to a sheet of paper, eliminates other players, and offers a quick, direct approach. Working alone or with a guide, the dreamer plays all the roles, speaks and hears the dialogue, harvests projections, and negotiates a resolution. </p>\n\n<p>The method came to me in a dream where I saw myself as a tiny human attached to the earth\u2019s globe by gravity. Up in the universal darkness, a giant megaphone shouted \u201CFIND THE IMAGE AND SATISFY IT.\u201D Immediately I understood that the way to resolution was through the image, and the way to the image was through your feelings. </p>\n\n<p>Since the age of three, I drew, painted, designed textiles, perfected and taught various crafts. When I had kids, I made bread sculpture, rag tapestries, furniture, and toys, and then turned it into how-to books. In the 1970\u2019s, as Program Director for the Boston Children\u2019s Museum Visitor Center, I developed how-to workshops so visitors could make paper, build looms and kites, and invent musical instruments from junk. I also conducted workshops for the New Hampshire elementary school system: sixty to ninety teachers came once a week for five-hour sessions on \u201CMethods and Materials\u201D and \u201CCreative Enrichment.\u201D We called it \u201CKindergarten for creatively deprived adults,\u201D who were then very excited to take the ideas and methods back to their classes. </p>\n\n<p>From there it was a short step to Expressive Therapy, a field just being defined at Lesley College. In addition to teaching there, I designed and completed my own Masters program based on work I did with teachers all over the country and in India. </p>\n\n<p>Dreams were an arrow leading straight to the unconscious. Like parables, they provide perspective on truths too close to see. Visual methods make problem solving exciting because they require you to think outside the box and use all kinds of intelligence and sources of wisdom. Impatient with the time required by conventional dream work, I asked students to \u201Cshow me your dream. Show me your problem. Create images. Make characters from torn tissue papers or find an object to represent people and things. Set the stage and tell the story on a sheet of paper.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>In half an hour, everyone in a class could create a scene and begin to work using ten simple questions. I just walked around the room helping to move things as needed. And there was the magic of working in groups. People borrowed from each other, saw what others were doing, heard the first solutions, and were inspired to take risks or reach out. Originality was rampant. Everyone left the room with new information, and often with a new resolution. </p>\n\n<p>A Harvard student who took a workshop said, \u201CThis work you do is more interesting than all my psychology courses. I\u2019d like my professor to see.\u201D I did a workshop there, but the professor asked what books I was using, what theory? </p>\n\n<p>\u201CNo books, no theory\u2014just common sense and the wisdom of the dream, the power of peoples\u2019 images. We simply \u2018satisfy the image.\u2019\u201D </p>\n\n<p>\u201CWell, that isn\u2019t going to make much sense to Academe is it?\u201D he says. </p>\n\n<p>\u201CNo. I guess not. It is not a theory; it is an experience.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>So you are the system. You are the method. It\u2019s the doing that heals, creates change, and enlightens. When you experience it, you know it. It is the \u201CAha!\u201D method. </p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfawar> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>After twenty years of lucid dreaming and many hundreds of lucid dreams, I had <em>had</em> it. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>maya</em> of dreaming, the <em>maya</em> of waking and the <em>maya</em> of being consciously aware in the dream state, I discovered, all seemed creative constructions that were activated and informed by my thoughts, expectations, feelings, and beliefs. My experienced reality, I came to see, was largely self-created and self-reflected.</p>\n\n<p>Yet somehow I intuitively felt that behind all of this <em>maya</em> was something\u2014some motivating force, some energy, some thing beyond me and my beliefs, thoughts, and expectations. It seemed to me that beyond the symbolic feedback and entrancing worldly drama of samsara must lay the source of the myriad worlds. I sought the source. </p>\n\n<p>It was then that I realized I had only one choice: to go <em>beyond</em> lucid dreaming; to let go of my own expectations, my thoughts and limiting conceptions, my self history and attachments\u2014to let it all go and then experience the reality beyond thought and belief, the base reality, the source of what is. </p>\n\n<p>For years in lucid dreams, I had surrendered to the awareness behind the dreaming. Consciously aware in the dream state, I would shout out, \u201CShow me something that I should see!\u201D and then watch as I was deposited, conscious and aware, into a powerfully meaningful dream setting. Lucidly surrendering to the awareness behind the dreaming taught me to trust implicitly the larger nature of the dreaming self and its wisdom. </p>\n\n<p>But now, I knew that to experience the reality behind all of this, meant letting go of all of this. To surrender to one\u2019s inner self was one thing, but to surrender to the source of <em>maya</em> took surrendering to a completely new level. </p>\n\n<p>Lying awake in bed one night at this time, I inwardly heard the question, \u201CSo you are ready to let go of everything? Every thought, every memory, every belief?\u201D Because I truly had had it with maya, I answered, \u201CYes!\u201D The quiet voice returned with a simple analysis, \u201CSo you\u2019re willing to allow yourself to cease?\u201D </p>\n\n<p>That question brought a sober finality to my quest. How far was I willing to take this venture beyond lucid dreaming? How deeply did I want to know what lay beyond apparent reality? </p>\n\n<p>Realizing that all these states\u2014 dreaming, waking, lucid dreaming\u2014 appeared as creative constructions formatively created by the mind, I knew my response to that sober question must be, \u201CYes, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it wasn\u2019t that night, but soon something strange occurred to me. Waking in the morning and turning to my dream journal to jot down the night\u2019s dreaming, all I could recall was blue light. Searching my mind, I realized that I didn\u2019t have a dream\u2014only an experience of blue light. No action, objects, dream figures or plot, not even a \u201Cme.\u201D Just an awareness of blue light. </p>\n\n<p>In my book, <em><a href=\"https://www.lucidadvice.com/books/lucid-dreaming-gateway-to-the-inner-self/\">Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</a></em>, I mention how one morning after a night of experiencing dreamless blue light, my wife asked me at the breakfast table, \u201CRobert, what\u2019s happening to you?\u201D A bit taken aback by such a strange question, I responded, \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D She then told me how she had wakened in the night and saw my face; she told me I looked like I was in \u201Cbliss.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>I muttered something about trying to understand consciousness and left it at that, though I felt surprised my wife had noticed \u201Csomething\u201D was happening to me. </p>\n\n<p>Actually, even I did not understand what was really happening to me. As if I had driven off the normal map of human experience and was now bushwhacking through uncharted territory, I had no context to place this in, or weathered guru to provide explanations. I felt on a path of my own making, being guided by my simple faith, fearlessness, and trust. I had had it with maya, and deeply intended to experience the source of apparent reality. </p>\n\n<p>As the months slipped by, a transformational, culmination experience occurred, which I can only call a nondual experience of the light of awareness by awareness itself. At last, I had gone beyond lucid dreaming\u2014beyond thought and self, beyond the self-constructed illusions of the mind\u2014and reached something unfathomable, luminous, and empty, <em>pure awareness</em>. </p>\n\n<p>For years, I kept this to myself. How can you explain going beyond lucid dreaming? How can the self discuss a self-less experience? Yet at my core, something had been transformed. Like survivors of NearDeath Experiences (NDEs), I no longer had a fear of death. I began to see how fear kept us corralled in a self adopted realm of limitation and constraint. At a deep level, I felt expansive freedom and space. </p>\n\n<p>Almost three years later, I happened to attend a presentation by the Buddhist Bon Lama, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, at the Association for the Study of Dreams conference in Hawaii. Speaking about the Buddhist\u2019s long tradition of dream yoga (using conscious awareness in the dream state), he explained that its ultimate goal was to experience a profound, non-dual state: the clear light of awareness.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not for me to say whether my experience equates to this ultimate experience of dream yoga. However, I can say that lucid dreaming\u2019s deeper explorations naturally allow for a transformational view of the human experience and the nature of reality. </p>\n\n<p>Followed deeply and with pure intent, conscious awareness in the dream state allows us to experiment with the fluid nature of time and space as we consciously seek out telepathic and clairvoyant experiences, and use our awareness for tasks like focusing directed healing energy on our physical self. Lucid dreaming enables us to go beyond our normal assumptions of dream figures and objects and interact with the awareness behind the dream, the larger Self, even surrendering to its broader perspective. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond self transformation, however, lucid dreaming provides science a revolutionary psychological tool to conduct experiments while consciously aware in the dream state. Imagine an experiment in which a lucid dreamer seeks out and retrieves precognitive or clairvoyant information that he or she gives to the scientist upon waking. It\u2019s definitely possible. In my book, I provide numerous examples of experienced lucid dreamers who have succeeded in their own personal experiments. </p>\n\n<p>Once the province of parapsychologists and Buddhist monks, lucid dreaming has radical transformational potential to usher in a new age of human potential and greater awareness. Individually, scientifically and culturally, lucid dreaming can help us discover the broader dimensions of Self and in so doing, transform society and its relationships. \u2118</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

This is a very new experience for me, so please be patient as I get adjusted to being up here.</p>\n\n<p>Before I begin, I'd like to thank all of the people who have encouraged me.  I'm not going to mention names, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the dreamers, writers, artists, poets, previous editors, everybody who has helped to keep the spirit that manifests as the publication Dream Network alive over the past 14 and a half years. Quite honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed a bit right now. I have \u201Cas has been true with Will\u201D known many of you for so long and yet am just tonight meeting you in person for the first time.  Additionally, I've never done anything like this before.  This is a first time, initiatory, trial-by-fire experience, and I ask your patience and your good energy.  And if you give that to me, you may be in for a little show, because I have a tendency to speak as much with my hands and my body as I do with my voice. So c'mon, I'll provide you with some entertainment!</p>\n\n<p>I want to begin tonight by sharing a piece that was given to me by a poet friend some years ago.  It was a piece read at a meeting of the New Latin American Poets in Mexico City some time ago. The author is unknown.  But it's a piece that I believe holds the essence of the spirit of the dream movement, and is a credo that we've adopted among those people who are networkers within the context of the Dream Network.  I then want to spend the majority of the time introducing those of you who aren't familiar with the publication and its history... to Dream Network by introducing previous editors and sharing a little bit about what we've been doing over the past 14 and a half years. I will conclude by sharing a piece that I've written about dreams and exploring the mystery.  So to begin, I will read, if I may,</p>\n\n<h2>A Message to Poets and Dreamers</h2>\n\n<p>\"We who are poets and dreamers know that the reason for a poem is not discovered until the poem itself exists.  The reason for a living act is realized only in the act itself.  This meeting is a spontaneous explosion of hopes.  That is why it is a venture in prophetic poverty, supported and financed by no foundation, organized and publicized by no official group, but a living expression of the belief that there are now in our world new people, new poets, new dreamers, who are not in tutelage to established political systems or cultural structures, but who dare to hope in their own vision of reality and of the future...</p>\n\n<p>\"This meeting is united in a flame of hope whose temperature has not yet been taken, and whose effects have not yet been estimated, because it is a new fire.  The reason for the fire cannot be apparent to one who is not warmed by it.  The reason for being here will not be found until all have walked together, without afterthought, into contradictions and possibilities...</p>\n\n<p>\"We believe our future will be made by love and hope, not by violence or calculation.  The Spirit that has brought us together, whether in space or only in agreement, will make our encounter an epiphany of certainties we could not know in isolation...</p>\n\n<p>\"The solidarity of poets and dreamers is not planned and welded together with tactical convictions or matters of policy, since these are affairs of prejudice, cunning, and design.  Whatever our failures, the poet and dreamer is not a cunning person.   His or her art depends on an ingrained innocence which he or she would lose in business, in politics, or in too organized a form of academic life.  The hope that rests on calculation has lost its innocence.  Let us band together to protect our innocence!\" (end \u2018Credo\u2019)</p>\n\n<p>That is called again, \"A Message to Poets,\" author unknown, but very relevant, I believe, to the challenge that stands before us as we create new ways of recognizing that so many of the ways that we've been taught are not working for us any longer.</p>\n\n<h2>History of Dream Network/Past Editors</h2>\n\n<p>Now I want to talk about what I know of the history of the Dream Network.  There are many details that I don't know.  I was fortunate to be able to make contact with most of the previous editors and get statements from them and I'll be sharing those.  But, in essence, I do know that the publication was started with an intention to bring dreams back to dreamers, to acknowledge the fact that we've learned that we all dream every night, and that we have a right to learn, to understand, the symbolic and metaphoric language of dreams.  It was begun in the spirit of being a grassroots publication and it's remained that way over the past 14+ years.  And it couldn't have happened without, as Will said, the dedication and effort that so many people have put into it over the years.  At this point, if we could have the house lights out, we'd like to show a few slides to show the evolution of the publication over the years.</p>\n\n<p>Dream Network was begun in January 1982 by a very fiery and compassionate young man by the name of Bill Stimson.  And I'd like to read... That's his picture there and that's the first issue of Dream Network.  And, in that issue he published an article that he wrote called, \"Armed with our Dreams.\" I'd like to read just the last paragraph of that article:</p>\n\n<p>\"Armed with our dreams, we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around.  The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women.  To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness.\"</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I wrote Bill and asked him if he'd be willing to share a few words and he was aware that I was going to be making this presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"The Dream Network is not the publication; the enterprise proper isn't a publishing one. To speak the truth of what the Dream Network is about for us is to find our myth -- where else but among our dreams? -- for us to use our dreams in a way that enables us to come together honestly and deeply, for what was broken to be rendered whole again, our community with one another, our connection with our deeper selves, our oneness in purpose, our ability and our resolve to embody the light itself. What makes the Dream Network special is that it's fundamentally different.  People sense this somehow and so they've helped the energy and unfoldment move forward.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>During Bill's time (and if you'd please show the next two slides, Will)... I don't understand the dynamics that were behind this, but there were different publications coming out in different parts of the country that were called Dream Network affiliate publications.  One of them was called Fusion.  I believe it came out of Seattle.  And there was another called DreamCraft, which came out of somewhere in the northeast.  I'm not certain about that, however.  There was a big stir of energy happening at that time.  One of my advisors and a very, very good friend, who is one that I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting in the flesh, is Barbara Shore.  And she was a part of the original New York dream community.  I wrote her and asked if she'd share some of her experiences from those early days. I think this might sound familiar to a lot of you because, I know in my own experience, when I first began having these incredible dreams, I didn't have too many places to turn and there wasn't a lot of information available to help me understand what was happening.  What Barbara has to say is,</p>\n\n<p><em>\"In my mind's eye is Bill Stimson's small, walk-up flat on a hot summer's night...the beginnings of the New York dream community.  We never formed a tight-knit group because the people kept changing too often for that.  The room was usually crowded...15 to 20 people.  Essentially, we knew nothing about dreams, but Bill's enthusiasm and passion for dreams was contagious. It was a dream whose time had come, like the classic dream of finding yourself in your own home but entering a new room that you've never been in before.  We were electrified.  This group was the core of the New York dream community and the New York dream community was the core of the early dream movement in the United States.  Although we couldn't articulate it at the time, I think we realized that we now had a mission in life. We were converts to dreams.  Was it Bill's vision of a global network of dreamers we were envisioning or did it arise spontaneously among us?  I don't know, but it was powerful.  When Bill got an idea, he didn't rest until he got it out there.  He was the prototype of the populist networker, the Trotsky of the dream revolution. It might have happened without him, but it never would have been so fast, so intense, so like a prairie fire in a season of drought.  Maybe this was the next step after the revolutionary 60's.  That world-changing vision hadn't fully worked, so maybe we had to go back to the inner drawing board, and remake the world from the individual psyche's infrastructure inside out, instead of the other way around.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Bill did the Dream Network; he was at that time putting it out monthly. It was a four to eight page bulletin.  And he did that for approximately two years, at which time it came into the hands and heart of Chris Hudson.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't contact...I couldn't locate Chris, so I don't have anything to share with you directly from him.  But I did meet him in my early days of work with the Dream Network, and want to share some of that meeting with you a little later on.  For this purpose, I'll say that I did get letters from people who have been long-time readers who made a lot of comments about their appreciation of Chris's willingness to share his own process, to share his own dreams during the years that he was editor and publisher.  And they also appreciated the very lively Letters to the Editor section that he introduced into the publication.</p>\n\n<p>Chris was in Brooklyn and Henry and Bob Van De Castle are the people who took responsibility for the publication next, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>Once again I don't know any of the dynamics that occurred when the publication was making its moves around the country. But Henry and Bob have shared that even before the Dream Network appeared on the scene, Henry had published several issues of the \"Sundance Community Dream Journal,\" which was the precursor to the Dream Network.  It was the first published journal declaring that dreams belong to dreamers.  The Sundance Journal and Henry's early efforts have had him dubbed \"The Father of the American Dream Movement\" in many circles.  Henry and his wife, along with Bob Van De Castle, took responsibility for the Dream Network in 1985, and during that time, Bob conducted a very successful dream telepathy experiment through the publication.  And Henry did a real interesting study on shoes as symbols in dreams.  Articles and his findings were published throughout the time that he and Bob were doing this.  I'm a little embarrassed and self-conscious because both Henry and Robert are sitting right here in front of me.  And I know that there are probably many things that I'm not saying. Would either of you like to make comments about your time? (Henry and Robert signal \u2018no.\u2019)</p>\n\n<p>Okay. ... During the period of time that they were co-editing the publication, Bob was also serving as the president of ASD.</p>\n\n<p>From their hands, in approximately 1987, it traveled into the hands and heart of Linda Magellon, here in nearby San Jose. Linda, who I don't believe is here tonight, (she said she had responsibilities elsewhere), had this to say,</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Dream Network Bulletin is a communal project.  It couldn't happen without the help of family, friends, and colleagues, without the assistance of volunteer staff, contributors, and subscribers.  Under my tutelage, the most important goal was to assure that new voices would be heard, new visions seen, especially those dreamers who'd not been previously published. They were nurtured and encouraged to dare to dream in the public forum.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Linda had a great deal of support as well from Bob Trowbridge and Jill Gregory, whom I know many of you are familiar with. It was during Linda's time that the publication first began to take on color. I think that if the right slide's up there, you're seeing the first issue that appeared with color on the cover.  </p>\n\n<p>My Own History with Dream Network,</p>\n\n<p>including a brief Dream autobiography</p>\n\n<p>In 1989, literally on summer solstice, I was informed that the Bay Area Dream Workers had accepted my \"bid,\" so to speak, to take responsibility for the publication.  And I'd like to go on kind of a diversionary path here for a moment and share a little with you about my history with dreams and my history with the Dream Network, because I recognize that I'm a stranger to most of you.  This is kind of a labyrinthical tale.  I hope you'll be able to follow along with me:</p>\n\n<p>It starts back in 1975-76.  I was in a very, very busy part of my life, living in the Pacific northwest and working full time, raising my family, in a new marriage.  One afternoon on a weekend, I took a nap and had the most extraordinary dream that I'll probably ever have in my life. It is the first dream that I ever recall as an adult.  I remember dreams from my childhood but this one was like going to a full-length movie.  When I awakened, I went, \"My goodness, what on earth was that?\" I'd been keeping a journal for several years and I immediately wrote down every detail of that dream.  In the dream...</p>\n\n<p>I found myself going into the community center where I was, actually where I actually worked, where my office was located.  It was a multi-service community center.  And rather than the typical kinds of activities that were taking place there on a day-to-day basis in waking reality, there were... Oh, as I was walking down the hallway... In this room there'd be dancers dancing, and in this room there'd be musicians playing, and in this room there'd be artists drawing...  And it was totally full of people who were doing all kinds of creative activities.  And as I went to the back of the building, into the area where (in daytime reality) there's a basketball court, there were groups of people working, constructing. I couldn't tell you what they were constructing, but they were using hammer and nails.  And every time, they were hammering in unison, and every strike of the hammer was in concert with music that was playing in the background.</p>\n\n<p>It was just a lovely sight to see.</p>\n\n<p>That's a part of the dream; that's the tone of the dream.</p>\n\n<p>That particular dream must have carved some new pathways in my psyche, because it was at that point in time that I began dreaming and recalling my dreams prolifically.  I didn't know what was happening.  I was seeking out everything I could find.  That was not long after Patricia Garfield's and Ann Faraday's books had come out, and I found those, and found a Jungian who lived in the community and went and spoke with him, learned a few things from him, continued to dream...</p>\n\n<p>Time went on, and in the fall of 1981, I was reading our local, weekly paper.  We had just elected a mayor in our community of Port Townsend who was a jazz pianist, and his wife was a flautist, and they were both very environmentally-conscious.  It was a very extraordinary and wonderful era in that community. He wrote a weekly column in the paper, and in August of 1981 his column said, \"Is there anyone out there who'd be interested in coordinating an event to honor the 35th anniversary of the United Nations?\"  For a number of reasons, which I won't go into now, I was compelled to respond to that call.</p>\n\n<p>I called together a group of my colleagues.  We had a meeting, literally at the office where I worked in the community center. And as we were brainstorming ideas about what would we do in our small little backwater town to acknowledge the United Nations anniversary, I began getting a full-blown memory of the dream that I'd had back in '75-76, and I said that to the group.  I said, \"My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!\"  And one man said, \"Well, we've got to do it then.\"  Thank God!  I mean he just picked right up on it.  There wasn't a beat that was skipped before he said that.  Each of us took a piece of the work away from that meeting and proceeded to coordinate this event, which occurred on October 11, 1981. The entire event, itself, was like walking through the dream that I'd had five years ago, step by step by step.  There were no details missing.  I was existing for that time, at that intersection between the dream reality and this reality, off the ground. It started at noon and continued until two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>In some of the rooms we had arranged that artists would be there drawing portraits.  We had arranged in other rooms that there would be international foods available. In other rooms, we arranged that there would be information booths sharing news from countries in which there were concerns like apartheid, and so forth.  And, in the back room, we had a program later in the evening that went on and on and on. It just did not want to end until it finally did at two or three in the morning with Sufi dancing. It was just an absolutely wonderful and very successful event.</p>\n\n<p>It was at that time that I knew something of extraordinary significance had just taken place and, on some level, a commitment was made in my soul to learn more, to understand more. At the same time, I'm still in this busy part of my life where there wasn't a lot of opportunity to seek out information.... and there wasn't a lot of information available.</p>\n\n<p>Well, not long after that event happened, I had a visit from a friend -- a woman poet  -- by the name of Christina Pacosz.  She had been published a few times in the publication.  And she came to me to ask, to tell me that she had just received a letter from a man in New York City who had just started a publication called the Dream Network Bulletin.  And he had asked her to find someone in the northwest area to, what her words were, \"to focalize dreamwork.\"  And she said, \"You're it.\"  And she gave me the letter and encouraged me to write him.  I sat down immediately after she left and wrote Bill Stimson a letter and sent a picture of myself off to him in New York.  Fortunately, I kept a copy, I don't know why, but I made a copy of that letter before I sent it off.  But I never got a response. It just felt, after two or three, four months went by, like it had gone off into a black hole in space.</p>\n\n<p>So once again back to the, you know, 8 to 5.  I'm back to work. This event that I just talked about, the poet coming to me, happened in the fall of '82, and I don't remember much, because I was still in that hurricane of work and family and so forth until the fall of 1987, when the harmonic convergence occurred on August 17.  I'd been carrying that date forward in my journal for about 20 years, because I thought it was going to be the magic moment, you know, the \u2018blink of an eye\u2019 that we\u2019re all waiting for. And I was invited to a number of different events that were happening to acknowledge that occurrence, but decided to go to a place nearby Boise, Idaho, to an event that was called, \"Dancing the Dream Awake.\" It was sponsored by Brook Medicine Eagle, and it was an all-night dance/ritual around the fire to acknowledge and celebrate the beginning of this period that we're in the midst of right now.</p>\n\n<p>After returning from that event, I can only say that things began to change very rapidly in my life.  It wasn't very long before I decided to let go of a 20-year career as a public servant, in a wide variety of very interesting jobs.  I was very fortunate, but it was time to let go.  I wasn't certain what I was going to do, but I knew that it had to have to do something with dreams.  I needed to learn more.  And so what I did was apply to a graduate degree program that I had found that would allow me the opportunity to co-create, with my committee and faculty people, a study plan that met my needs.  And I found that program and was accepted. It was Vermont College, at Norwich University. In the early stages of that program, one of my first responsibilities was to meet with my committee and faculty people for the purpose of designing the study plan.  That process took place in California, in the spring of 1989. I went to Southern California and developed the plan.  We worked over a period of two or three weeks.  I got my study plan approved.</p>\n\n<p>At that time, I had moved back to my home state, Utah.  When it was time to leave California, which is a two-day trip, I took a different route than I normally do, and stayed on the west side of Hopi land.  I was on a Navajo reservation, that night staying in a Navajo-owned motel. I want to back up just one minute and tell you that, while I was in the process of developing this study plan, I had relocated the Dream Network.  I had found out it was being published out of San Jose and subscribed while I was in California.  So the night that I'm staying at the motel on Navajo land, west of the Hopi reservation, I had a dream.</p>\n\n<p>In the dream, I saw  papers hanging from the branch of a tree, blowing in the wind, and heard a voice say, \"If you don't do it, somebody else will.\" I woke up and wondered, \"What on God's green earth could that possibly mean?\"  I had no idea.</p>\n\n<p>I made my way home to Moab, Utah, which is where I've been off and on for the last 40 years.  Shortly after I got there, now with this new project, this new adventure before me, this new challenge of the graduate degree program, I was all ready to launch in it...  But not long after I got there, something occurred which is very typical in that part of the country, and it was a period of seven to ten days of absolutely relentless winds, 24 hours a day, just stirring up all of the sand in the desert, and making it virtually impossible to feel like you could complete a task in the way that you normally would, because it was very unnerving.</p>\n\n<p>After two or three days of trying to accomplish something and being unsuccessful, I decided to stop trying and threw a few books and my journal in the day-pack, and walked up a canyon, a very beautiful canyon that I live near, and spend the day in a cave, a beautiful cave...In fact, a cave that I was guided to in a dream some years before.</p>\n\n<p>On my way up the canyon, I stopped at my mailbox and, lo and behold, there was my first issue of the Dream Network Bulletin!  It had just arrived and so I put it in my day-pack, headed up the canyon, got about half way up the trail (it was going to be a mile, mile and a half, before I got to the cave)and I heard a voice say, \u201CYou\u2019re going to see a snake.\u201D... then immediately, a snake slithered across the trail. I said thank you to the voice,  hello to the snake and went on my way.</p>\n\n<p>When I got to the cave...  (it's a beautiful cave. If you ever come to Moab, please look me up.  I'll take you there.  You won't believe it.  It's absolutely gorgeous!) ...and I  took everything out of my day-pack.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I did was grab the new issue of Dream Network, open it at random, and the first thing I saw was the graphic image of an eye with a snake coiled in the pupil, and it just...goosebumped me!  Ah, I'll never forget that moment.  I knew something was about to happen, and when I turned just inside the front cover, the words that my eyes fell on were,</p>\n\n<p>\"This publication is seeking a new Editor/Publisher.\"</p>\n\n<p>Well, I threw everything right back in my day-pack, ran back home,  called Linda, and began communicating with her -- a communication that took place over a two or three month period of time, both by phone and letter.  As I said earlier, on summer solstice 1989, I was called by Linda and told that the Bay Area dreamworker\u2019s group had agreed to pass the responsibility, the torch, and the beauty -- and what an adventure it is! -- on to me.</p>\n\n<p>Not long after Linda informed me, she put out her last issue from San Jose. In it, she introduced me.  Shortly after that issue came out, I got a call from Chris Hudson, and here's where I'm going to go back to my story about Chris, because he had just moved from Brooklyn to Bellingham, Washington, very nearby where I was living, and was very excited that the publication was going to be happening so nearby him.  At that time, I was again in the northwest doing my graduate degree program. By the way, I know that part of my tale has got to be confusing because I was literally like a pinball, bouncing back and forth between the northwest and the southwest during this period of time. So don't get too confused.  I was on the Olympic Peninsula and back in Utah quite a number of times during that period. Chris called and wanted to come over and meet me.  So we agreed on a weekend, he came, and it was a very beautiful day. I had decided to suggest that we go to a beautiful park in Port Townsend to have our talk.  He was agreeable. So we went to Chetzemoka, got out of the car, began walking into the park, and Chris stopped in his tracks and said, \"My God, I've got a picture of you sitting right over there in that flower garden.\"  And I said to him, \"How could you have a picture of me sitting over there in that flower garden? We just met 15 minutes ago!\"  And he proceeded to tell me that when responsibility for the publication was handed to him by Bill Stimson, that there were a good number of unopened pieces of mail.  Among them, the letter that I had sent to Bill back in 1982, which contained my picture.</p>\n\n<p>One gets a feeling of a certain amount of destiny when these kinds of things happen.</p>\n\n<p>Evolution of Dream Network in current years</p>\n\n<p>The next few slides are some pictures and images of the issues that have come out over the seven years that I've been doing the publication. During this past several years, we've evolved, naturally, a few new dimensions to the publication.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first steps that I took was to develop a Council of Advisors, and I'd like to just name those people.  Many of you know some of them, and some of these people may be completely unfamiliar, but I really want to acknowledge them because they've been an incredible help and aid to me on so many occasions:  Kelly Hunter, she's from the east coast; Stanley Krippner, most of you know; Marcia Lauck, who is here in San Jose and co-author of \"At the Pool of Wonder\"; Will Phillips, who you all met a short while ago; Bill Schuman, from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Barbara Shor, from New York City; and Graywolf/Fred Swinney, from southern Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>There have been other individuals who have served during my time that include Montague Ullman, Jeremy Taylor, Deborah J. Hillman, and all of whom really taught me a lot and helped a great deal during the period of time that they served in that capacity.  We also made a decision to focus each issue around a question or a theme and that seems to have worked very well.  It narrows the focus so that we aren't wandering too far over creation.</p>\n\n<p>We've developed a statement of purpose.  I'd like to read just an excerpt of that for you:</p>\n\n<p>\"Our purpose is to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams.  We seek to disseminate information that will assist and empower us in taking responsibility for our  cultural, emotional and spiritual well-being, with the help of dreams and mythology.  Our goals are to unite and serve those who respect dreams, to empower dreamers in demystifying dreamwork, and to assist with the integration of dreamsharing in our culture, in whatever way of integrity is shown and given us.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>In the last couple of years, we've activated the title of the publication by encouraging committed and knowledgeable dreamworkers around the country...and in  Canada, France,  Germany, South Africa... to become listed in each issue as Networkers/Contact Persons.  Over 50 individuals are listed in each issue of the Dream Network, and are there to respond to your calls, your questions, your needs, to point you to resources, to point you to existing dream groups or help you form dream groups.  So those individuals are listed, and willing to share and make the path a lot smoother for new seekers than it was for us.</p>\n\n<p>We've also evolved from what was a 24-page publication to 52 pages.</p>\n\n<p>We've currently developed a presence on the World Wide Web - that's been an incredible experience to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>We've begun just recently accepting advertising.</p>\n\n<p>We created one subject-specific booklet that's composed of articles drawn from our very rich archives.  The one that is now published is, \"The Art of Dreamsharing and Developing Dream Groups.\"  And we hope to publish a series of booklets bringing forth so many of these beautiful words of wisdom and experience, and articles that have only really been seen by a small handful of people over this last 14 and a half years.</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, we're being distributed nationally on a relatively small basis, but nevertheless, being distributed nationally.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to close by reading and sharing some of what I've learned over this past seven years, and something else that I believe that we all have in common:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploring the Mystery of Dreams</strong></p>\n\n<p>Together we have learned that dreams constitute a field of</p>\n\n<p>meaning and purpose as vast and complex as our knowledge</p>\n\n<p>of the known universe. </p>\n\n<p>We know that, although we're just becoming reacquainted,</p>\n\n<p>other cultures and civilizations in the world have valued,</p>\n\n<p>cherished, utilized, and manifested dreams and visions for centuries. </p>\n\n<p>Many have been persecuted over the past 20 centuries</p>\n\n<p>for doing the work we share today. </p>\n\n<p>Like mercury, the field of dreams is elusive,</p>\n\n<p>a mystery, expansive, ever evading definition,</p>\n\n<p>description, categorization,</p>\n\n<p>and forever earning our respect.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we all agree that dreams are meaningful and purposeful.</p>\n\n<p>We know that we all dream every night,</p>\n\n<p>in fact many dreams each night.</p>\n\n<p>Not all of our dreams are recalled,</p>\n\n<p>and not all that are recalled can be readily</p>\n\n<p>comprehended or shared with another.</p>\n\n<p>We know dreams are essential and vital tools in therapy,</p>\n\n<p>still they can be engaged in silence,</p>\n\n<p>in our journals, with our spouse, our children, our neighbors,</p>\n\n<p>in dream groups, because we know we all dream every night.</p>\n\n<p>We have learned that dreams can be incubated to solve problems,</p>\n\n<p>answer questions, provide guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams often give timely warnings for ourselves or for another.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams provide insight, bring darkness into light.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams awaken us, frighten us, shake us up,</p>\n\n<p>puzzle and perplex us, allow us to waken within them. </p>\n\n<p>And, if we're inclined, to control them.</p>\n\n<p>We can meet together in the dreamtime reality,</p>\n\n<p>a time and space beyond time-space.</p>\n\n<p>In dreams, we can fly or die, and be reborn.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams show us the future, shed light on the past,</p>\n\n<p>even past lives.</p>\n\n<p>In dreams, we're often prepared for the death of a loved-one,</p>\n\n<p>and there is provision of ground for contact with them</p>\n\n<p>from the other side.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams are known to have been the catalyst for authoring books,</p>\n\n<p>composing music,</p>\n\n<p>creating new inventions,</p>\n\n<p>inspiring poetry,</p>\n\n<p>creating art and sculpture.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams prophesize.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams are spirits' way of speaking to us.</p>\n\n<p>Dreams heal.</p>\n\n<p>In one word, dreams Reveal.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfamil> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfamil-0.jpg\" alt=\"Family sleeping in bed\" width=\"500\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>Family-related feelings and family consciousness are some of the most powerful influences on the psychological patterns of individuals. The influence of family patterns is extraordinarily powerful in its depth and intensity. Because of this, we frequently dream about the members of our families. It is quite common and normal to have dreams in which family members are prominently involved. The vast majority of these dreams are the usual dreams in which a parent or sibling is doing something that we generally recognize as their normal behavior. Sometimes, however, they are doing something unusual or even paradoxical in our dreams. Very often, extremely strong feelings and images occur which show us the emotions we feel toward these special people in our lives. The dream, with its strange contours and story-line, is the perfect field on which to portray \"raw\" emotions, and consequently, the dream can really be a pulse taken on the heartbeat of family life.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last century Freud and others have told us that dreams both hide and reveal what people deep down <em>really</em> feel and think about each other and themselves. In the dream state our hold on reality is not as well guarded as it is when we are wide awake. Our psychological defenses are to a large extent gone and what appears to be \"reality\" becomes very intense and visual. We have learned from jung and his followers that there are great spiritual energies, treasures, and messages from the collective unconscious hidden in dreams. This collective unconscious is a vast reservoir of knowledge, wisdom, and experience that has been experienced and collected by humanity through the ages.</p>\n\n<p>We also know that lucid dreaming and ancient healing practices make use of entering the dream in a certain kind of way and using its power to transform reality. Thus it has become quite clear that we can influence the dream much more than we had earlier thought we could. finally we know from many parapsychological studies that ESP or psi occurs a great deal in certain kinds of dreams, especially between dreamers who are both dreaming about the same person. Any number of possibilities can occur when we are dreaming because the \"boundaries\" between individuals change significantly in the dream state. </p>\n\n<p>For example, after a sleepfilled night in December, my wife and I mentioned our dreams to each other as is our custom. I had dreamed a strange dream in which a \"grandmother type\" was trying to reach or catch me. She triggered \"mixed feelings\" in me as to whether she was trying to protect me or somehow \"get me.\" Also in the dream the grandmother attempted to steal or cut off a pickle I had! Having a somewhat Freudian lens, I made note of the sexual aspect of this. I later woke with a slightly eerie feeling about the dream. </p>\n\n<p>On the same night my wife dreamed my grandmother had a necklace with a moon-shaped crescent locket which fell partly from her neck and turned into a knife or sharp edge. My wife then wondered in the dream whether the grandmother was gay. </p>\n\n<p>Notice the correspondences in the grandmother images, the sexual feelings, and the act of cutting. These appeared in both dreamscapes. Neither of us had discussed grandmothers for a long time and we could remember no events recently that would account for the dream in terms of day residue. </p>\n\n<p>While on a post-doctoral fellowship, I had the opportunity to study the dreams of families in therapy. To my surprise, we discovered that recurrent patterns of interaction and behavior are reflected in the dreams of each family member. This was especially true when the family was going through a crisis or some intense situation. </p>\n\n<p>We noted the simple fact that families are often living in the same place, including the same house and rooms for decades and sometimes for generations. They are often in similar sleep and dream cycles at the same time of the night. Certain coordinating tendencies could be seen. It became very clear to us that the major emotional issues in the family were each reflected in slightly different ways in each family member's inner landscape. In a certain sense, each family member's dream life reflected the dream life of each other family member. </p>\n\n<p>In one family, we worked with the following recurring dream of a 15 year old girl. She dreamed that she \"escaped\" from her parents' house and jumped into their car. As she drove away, the father would run toward her but never manage to quite catch her. The closer he got, the faster the car went. Finally the girl fully escaped him only to run headlong into a telephone pole and kill herself. In this family's therapy sessions, the themes of autonomy and separation with a great deal of anxiety occurred repeatedly. The daughter fought continually with her parents over her own intense involvement with a young man of whom the family did not approve. She felt rebellious and dominated by her parents, in particular her father. However, when she stayed away from home too long, she began to experience somatic problems and wanted to \"lose\" herself in male companionship. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfamil-1.jpg\" alt=\"Couple dancing\" width=\"500\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<p>Another dream by the girl's 12 year old sister revealed a similar theme. The younger girl dreamed that a large \"awful\" man ran around screaming at her mother, her older sister, and herself. Finally, the man stepped on all three but did not kill them. The dream recurred several times. The family that provided this dream series was composed of a father who had a manic-depressive psychosis, an extremely religious, compulsive mother, and two teenage girls. All three women in the family had psychosomatic problems, such as stomach cramps, persistent gas pains, migraines, and frequent depression.</p>\n\n<p>In working with families in therapy and others, we noted that psi or telepathy often occurs in a variety of situations. We noted that different families naturally had different styles and that certain families communicated, albeit irregularly, with each other through dreams. Some families rarely, if ever, did. In some measure these psi or paranormal dreams can be predic- ted and observed. We found this a very exciting discovery and as we talked with others, we found out more and more people have had the same kind of experiences in their families too. </p>\n\n<p>What we discovered was a field of <em>shared</em> images, ideas, and feelings in each individual within the family. This shared family emotional field, which we call the family unconscious, is a shifting, interconnected field of energy that does not obey the conventional rules of space and time in the waking state. This field of interconnected energy, influence, and information in many ways parallels some of the developments in sub-atomic physics. In a curious way, each emotional dreamscape reflected or implicated each other dreamscape. A certain kind of hologram appeared in which each part could reflect all other parts in slightly different ways. </p>\n\n<p>We know that our \"boundaries\" and identities intermingle in the dream state with those we dream about. This seems to take a systematic approach when it comes to the dreams of people who are deeply and powerfully interconnected with each other over years and years by shared events, feelings, and patterns of behavior such as in family life. The powerful emotions and the shared histories of families make this possible. There also seems to be a significant rise in psi experiences among such dreamers. As we have outlined in <em>The Family Unconscious</em>, dreams among family members can be used for all kinds of transpersonal work, including family therapy and other kinds of healing. As we continue to collect data about family dreams and explore other areas of the family unconscious, we are growing more and more convinced that a vast reservoir of healing is located in the collected dreams and memories of the people who are most dear to us through so many important years of our lives.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zmcat2> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><em>Author's Note: Dreams come in many forms with many messages and levels of interpretation. I have found that dreams fall into ten different categories. These categories overlap, giving varied depth of meaning to even \"simple\" dreams. I previously discussed the first five categories (DNJ Vol. 11 No.1). Now I'd like to complete the list so that you may use this to cross-reference your own dreams. It is very important to remember and give attention to these nightly scenarios.</em> </p>\n\n<h2>6. Bad Dreams or Nightmares</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone has had a bad dream at some point in their lives. Often these are the only dream experiences remembered. With an on-rush of adrenaline, you wake with a start and the emotions overwhelm you while reliving those scary scenes. \"Bad\" dreams, above all, should be paid close attention. There are several possible reasons for these types of dreams. </p>\n\n<p>a) Nightmares shock you into remembering and/or facing certain fears, emotions, or blocks. Your conscious mind hasn't gotten the message (you don't remember the \"simpler\" dreams or else you don't pay attention to their messages). So your subconscious \"slaps you awake\" with a scenario that is so dramatic that you will remember and with such an emotional impact that it has an effect! Unfortunately, most people treat nightmares as \"only a dream\". Instead, the dreamer should view these dreams as highly important - kind of a last, drastic attempt by the subconscious to get through. Take a look at the dream characters and actions, break them down to specific characteristics and see how they might apply to your waking life. </p>\n\n<p>b) They are acting out possible negative scenarios to release negative energy. It shows you that waking reality isn't so bad. All actors are familiar with \"the actor's nightmare\". You go out on stage to do a musical and suddenly the rest of the cast is doing Shakespeare. You're in the wrong costume and you don't know any of the lines! AGH! At the next rehearsal in your waking life, everyone else is still doing the same show you thought you were in. Relieved by this affirming reality, you have more confidence as you step onto the stage. </p>\n\n<p>c) Nightmares personify negative feelings in order to deal better with fears. Shirley MacLaine, at her Higher Self Seminar, shared a recurring childhood nightmare. In the dream, she was being chased by a huge, mean gorilla. She ran and ran, barely keeping out of reach of the gorilla. Finally, she came to the edge of a cliff. This is where she usually woke up - terrified! One night, she was having the same dream, only this time when she reached the edge of the cliff, she turned. \"What do you want?\" she cried out to the gorilla. He replied, \"I don't know, little girl. It's your dream.\" This humorous anecdote shows how we create the scary images from our dreams and we can control the outcome. By understanding what is behind our fear, we can overcome the possible negative outcome and make that dream character our ally. </p>\n\n<p>d) Coming out of the dream state into a more wakeful state, the conscious mind can become aware of and evaluate the dream material. Those dreams where you are berng chased but can't move are likely to be times when the conscious mind checks in on the dream, yet realizes the body is \"frozen\" in its R.E.M. stage, thus the feeling of not being able to move. The conscious mind doesn't realize that this state is a dream and panics, waking you up in distress. Please don't brush aside these bad dreams just to relieve yourself. These are important dreams with important messages and should be given your waking focus. If you ignore these dreams, then the problems or difficult situations are almost forced to manifest in your waking life. </p>\n\n<h2>7. Clarification Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Further dreams can:</p>\n\n<p>a) Clarify previous dreams</p>\n\n<p>b) Give a clearer message </p>\n\n<p>c) Using the same symbol, show a different scenario that clarifies that symbol. </p>\n\n<p>For example, I had several dreams about my highschool vocal coach. The first time I dreamt about him, I assumed the dream content would relate to his life at that time. Since we are still friends, I contacted him, but he could not confirm the dream's message as relating to him. So I asked my dreams for clarification. My next dream dealt with my own career progress at that time and was easily interpreted. Again, I asked for dream clarification about my former voice teacher. The next time I dreamt about this man, I clearly understood that he represented a time when I was very clear about my career aspirations. He had personally been very supportive of my desires. He, as a symbol, represented the support of those goals. Now when he appears in my dreams, it is usually at a time when I really need this support.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Assistance for Others</h2>\n\n<p>They can give:</p>\n\n<p>a) General aids</p>\n\n<p>b) Insight into specific problems (often seen symbolically rather than literally)</p>\n\n<p>c) Symbolic understanding of trends and probable future events. Just like in your own \"body and health awareness\" dreams, you can pick up on health problems in a close friend or family member. But it doesn't have to be specifically health-related. You can dream about a brother who is overworking himself; in the dream he begins to make mistakes, eventually getting fired. You can check with this brother to see if he is indeed overworking himself. In any dream that seems to deal directly with another person, check with that other person first to see if the dream has significance for them. However, whether it has significance for the other or not, realize that you had the dream for a reason! Maybe you are overworking yourself and can't see it, so the dream non-threateningly shares this information. It is important to take the dream content back to the dreamer and apply the messages and symbols, however subtle, to the dreamer's personal life. </p>\n\n<h2>9. Psychic Awareness Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>This category gets the most phenomena attention. Most people have had at least one form of psychic awareness through a dream. The most common are:</p>\n\n<p>a) Connections with \"other world\" people. Your grandmother has died recently and one night you dream that she visits to tell you that she is all right and very safe. \"There is nothing to fear in death. I am still with you\", she shares. Another common experience is </p>\n\n<p>b) Telepathy about past, present or future events for: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Yourself. For example, you dream about skidding on the ice and your car swerves off the road. The next day as you travel in those winter conditions seen in your dream, you are particularly cautious. Your car hits the ice patch and you are able to correct your car before sliding off into the ditch. </p></li>\n<li><p>Your friends or family. You dream that your mother falls down the stairs. The next day, because of your awareness from this dream, you stop by your mother's house and arrive just after she indeed has fallen. By your prompt arrival, the situation turns out to be much less serious. </p></li>\n<li><p>Your community. Many people in a community often dream about a significant event that will happen in their area. For example, some might dream about a tornado hitting their town. When weather conditions sour a few days later, they are more prepared to face the potential disaster. </p></li>\n<li><p>National or global. Several people, including the President, foresaw Lincoln's assassination in their dreams. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, the important thing to do with these clairvoyant dreams is first to react to them literally. Then look internally to see why that dream might have significance for you personally. Perhaps your emotional life is about to experience a \"tornado\" and you need to go within to your \"shelter\" to withstand the impending storm. A third psychic category is:</p>\n\n<p>c) Past-life memories. You awaken from a very vivid dream about life during King Arthur's reign. The dream seems so much more \"real\" than waking life. All day you can't shake the images. Perhaps you are tuning into past-life memories of a life during that time period. As with any past-life work, it is important to apply any insights, messages or lessons to the present. By tuning into that past life during King Arthur's reign, you may rekindle that feeling of a noble and charitable life, when standing up for \"right\" did enable \"might\". </p>\n\n<h2>10. Spiritual Connection Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>These dreams can share: </p>\n\n<p>a) Spiritual lessons</p>\n\n<p>b) Universal truths</p>\n\n<p>c) Unconditional love </p>\n\n<p>d) Connection with \"angels\", guides, teachers, your Higher Self, and God. </p>\n\n<p>I had an incredible dream experience a few years ago that falls under this category. The dream was very long and complicated, but one section I'd like to share: </p>\n\n<p><em>I was with a close friend. When I looked over at him, we zoomed out of our bodies and flew up high over the earth. The earth looked so clear and beautiful. When we returned to earth, we did not rejoin our bodies. Instead, when I looked at my friend, I saw only his etheric body, vibrant energy and light! As I looked into this energy field, I saw in a flash (not like in a movie, but instant knowing) all of his many lives and experiences. When I looked down at my own energy field, I was of the same type of energy and light and also knew all that I'd ever experienced. We discussed the many choices we'd made and laughed at how complicated we'd made life, how many times we'd lost perspective. Then an overwhelming feeling of unconditional love swept over me.</em></p>\n\n<p>It was like <em>nothing</em> I'd ever experienced before! This experience left me with a heightened perspective and love flowed over into all areas of my life. </p>\n\n<p>Dreams are a precious gift we receive nightly. By learning to remember and unravel the various layers, dreams can add a special awareness to our loves and the choices we make. Dreams can be likened to a nightly therapy session. The only cost is the attention to explore these rich, nightly scenarios. Keep these categories in mind when viewing your own dreams and good luck in this rewarding avenue of personal discovery. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(c) ROSEMARY WATTS</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6krudhp> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"The true history of the spirit is not preserved in learned volumes but in the living psychic organism of every individual.\" -C.G. Jung C.W. 11,56</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><!--nopreview--><h2>I. Psyche Speaks</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>\n\n<p>It is quite remarkable, because it is so rare, to see in public such a collection of unattributed, uncommented, unexplained, unanalyzed, uninterpreted dreams as those <a href=\"../bcpqoa3iell\">on exhibit in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em></a> this past year. As your editor said in introducing this unusual gathering, she wanted \"psyche to speak for itself\" in response to the journal's research calling for \"dreams which belong to the larger community.\" This simple appeal reaped a rich and varied bounty. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, psyche has spoken! But to whom? To what end? Do not expect me to answer these questions by interpreting or analyzing the dreams in this exhibition. That would violate the spirit with which they were gathered. Instead, imagine we had been viewing these dreams in silence and began speaking with one another. A conversation. For some reason, in the face of these dreams, I want to speak in whispers, though these dreams stir strong passions in me. Of course, my murmurings on these pages are rather one sided. So I'll just set off and see what comes.</p>\n\n<h2>II. Dreams as Gift &amp; Voice of Source</h2>\n\n<p>What has been gathered together in this harvest called \"Dreaming Humanity's Path,\" this dream gallery of psyche's speech? First, we find dreams experienced as gifts given to an audience of one (the dreamer) arriving unbidden, seemingly from some dimension beyond the personal and gifted again to a larger audience .... we, the community of the journal's readers. As the word itself reveals (com-, \"together\"; munnus, \"gift\"), it is precisely this circulation of gifts, this \"gifting together\" that identifies the essential nature of any genuine community. In some quiet time you might want to ponder how to keep such gifts circulating. </p>\n\n<p>Second, we find dreams experienced as big dreams, dreams of strikingly numinous intensity, the dreamer impelled to share the dream with another, as if following some ancient imperative... perhaps even one of evolutionary significance.</p>\n\n<h2>\"This dream is not yours alone; it belongs to others as well. Tell it!\"</h2>\n\n<p>Surely one intention of such dreams and their telling is to stir us to wakefulness, to choicefull participation in the making of our future. </p>\n\n<p>Third, the dreamer of the big dream experiences a strangely palpable contact with \"the source\" of that dream, and in gifting the dream to others, this sense of contact and thus potential community with \"the source\" is enlarged. All readers and hearers of the big dream may become directly or subliminally more related to \"the source\" of such dreams. I'll leave it to the reader to imagine the social and political consequences of this. </p>\n\n<p>Fourth, this \"source\" is not experienced as personal or individual. One feels a bit shy even at saying \"my\" dream. Rather, there is a sense of something \"sent\", as if by courier, a meaning-filled message from underneath or beyond the personal. There is as well a definite feeling that it is this \"rhizomic\" dimension in which we all may be connected in some mysterious and unfathomable way. We can't say much about this \"source\" with any assurance. And while there are many names for this source, I will refer to it here simply as the mythic realm. I think the reason why such dreams are sensed by the dreamer as having immediate significance, not only to the dreamer but to everyone, is because such dreams are intimations of myths in formation, myths that will underlie the fabric of all that we are and all that we do, and all that we will become. Such dreams are not just recyclings of old myths or retellings in new clothes, but <em>new</em> myths that will be the structure and dynamics of our future.</p>\n\n<p>The dreams collected here might be titled more accurately, \"Dreaming Humanity's Path<em>s</em>\", for it is surely more meaningful to think not of one fixed future, but of many possible futures. What our conscious role in such futures might be, what determinant role our choices might have, could be informed by big dreams in a way that we have scarcely allowed ourselves to imagine.</p>\n\n<h2>III. Dreams &amp; Community</h2>\n\n<p>The reason why interpretation fails big dreams is that interpretation tends toward understanding even big dreams only in terms of what already is known, while the big dream is speaking, as Jung said, in terms that are not yet fully known. The big dream cannot be fully netted by interpretive approaches because it speaks in a language (or languages) not yet fully known. In this sense, we must always be students of the big dream, trying always to learn the language of the mythic realm, to learn psyche's speech. </p>\n\n<p>In earlier times, when communities were truly local, such dreams were conveyed to \"the elders\" and if judged to be big dreams, they were then conveyed to all members of the community. This way with the dream played a crucial role in engendering the fabric of community life because such dreams became the source of and foundation for the myths of the people. In the present time, this natural sense of sharing the big dream with others is so rare we have very nearly lost all sense of the crucial importance of this. We no longer even have rituals for doing so. We need to relearn this art. </p>\n\n<p>In the contemporary world, how do such dreams find their way into community? What and when does the larger community ever hear of such dreams? Where in the world do we hear these messages from the mythic realm in a collective sense? I hear nothing of this on the TV talk shows. I see nothing in the newspapers. I do not hear our \"elders\" or world leaders telling us of big dreams. </p>\n\n<p>This is where <em>Dream Network</em> is doing important work and where the dream sharing groups and communities have their ultimate significance. We have no larger forums for hearing our big dreams. In <em>Psyche Speaks</em>, I wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"...to have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the time to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How I would love to see a journal, a TV program, a radio show, even a web site in which only the dream text itself is presented, a cultural repository for big dreams. Seeing these dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em> is like a seedling for such possibilities. We need places to hear big dreams. As a community we can contribute to this need by continuing to send in our big dreams to Dream Network. Something will come of this! </p>\n\n<h2>IV. Alterity, Fate &amp; Dream's Desire</h2>\n\n<p>We can't say much about \"the source\" except to emphasize its strong sense of alterity, its otherness. It is this alterity that the big dream brings to our awareness and, I believe, stirs a yearning, a deep desire, an eros. Part of this is reflected as noted above in the impulse to share the dream with others. But telling others, as deeply satisfying as this is, is not sufficient. Something else is at work on us in relation to the big dream. A hint as to what this might be was offered to me in a dream several years ago. In it, I found written on a slip of paper, poem like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h2><em>A dream wants a dream</em></h2>\n  \n  <h2><em>A poem wants a poem</em></h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As much as I enjoy interpreting dreams, teaching others to learn and exercise the craft of interpretation, and even as an analyst getting paid for it, I know that interpretation is not the desire of the dream. The dream wants a dream! So, now I imagine that the purpose of the \"small\" dream is to make us conscious and more complete (that is through resolving complexes, integrating the shadow, developing our human relatedness), essential, crucial and necessary tasks. </p>\n\n<p>And the purpose of the big dream? Its purpose is twofold: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>To engender community through the medium of telling the dream, that is, dream calling to dream, the dream of one desiring the dream of the other, and </p></li>\n<li><p>To create a sense of task, the sense of what the dreamer is <em>for</em> in this life, and from that, for the dreamer to bring the manifestation of that to some realization in actual life and therefore into the reality that is the world. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Perhaps this sense of human community may become realized in the Aquarian age, the age of the water bearer. This is an image of each one of us in some unique contact with \"the source\" and from that contact bringing something back to the larger community. Part of that \"bringing back\" is the dream itself and part of our contribution to the weaving of the threads of community is to tell our big dreams to one another. In this way, the \"otherness\" in the big dream is able to call forth the \"otherness\" in others through engendering dreams in others. </p>\n\n<p>The dream wants a dream. But our task is not complete by telling only. The big dream always imposes some task on the dreamer. That task has a great deal to do with whatever we mean by \"fate.\" It is the work of the dreamer to bring into presently lived life some manifestation of the big dream. That manifestation, too, will likely be shared and will constitute, through its giftlike circulation, a vitalizing presence in the world. </p>\n\n<h2>V. Dream-Formed Communities</h2>\n\n<p>Klee said he didn't want to give talks about art because people would listen with their ears and not their hands. And if one were to listen with one's hands? Of course! Listening hands would be painting hands! A painting wants a painting! That's why Baudelaire said the only proper criticism of a work of art is a work of art. Art wants art! This desire is not ego's desire but the desire of the \"other\" in us for connection to \" the other\" in our fellow beings. It is out of this connection (deep psyche to deep psyche) that there could arise a basis for community that would be generative and give birth and manifestation to the deepest intentionality of the psyche. This is what I see as the ultimate significance of sharing big dreams: <em>a dream-formed community</em>. This is not a picture of only single, isolated individuals individuating apart from the world. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of individuation cannot be isolation. Rather, the purpose of individuation must be for an individual to develop sufficiently to hear the \"deep song\" of the psyche, to bring into the world what is experienced there, and to pour this into the living history of humanity. This in turn will call to the deep psyche in others and stimulate this self-same process. It is the iteration of this process across individuals that is the promise of the postmodern spirit. The intent is not narrow, narcissistic individualism, but to so engage individual development so that the common pool becomes a rich resource for the nourishment and growth of each and everyone. As Jung saw, <em>\"individuation gathers the world to itself.\"</em> </p>\n\n<h2>VI. Forming the Vessel</h2>\n\n<p>A newspaper published recently a story of two women artists who decided to correspond only in painting. So, one woman sent a painting to the other. After living and being with that painting for a time, that woman painted her response and sent it off. Back and forth, paintings only. Twenty of these paintings are now on exhibit in a gallery. Very instructive! For anyone drawn to dream sharing, corresponding in dreams (just the dreams, not the interpretation!) may open up many new and unexplored possibilities. As a community we might try just this and see what happens. Or, in your dream sharing groups try this. Sit for a time in silence and bring to mind dreams or visions that had a powerful impact on you. When you feel ready, simply speak out an image from such a dream. Others will do the same. Round and round, speaking out only images from dreams, no comment, no interpretation, no explanation. Telling images without the apparatus of explanation engenders a powerful field effect in the group, a palpable dimensionality that begins to generate an enormous eros. One gets the impression of a vessel of information, a place of potential incarnation of something beyond the personal aspects of the dreamers in the circle. The potential of this is unexplored. And waiting. </p>\n\n<p>What is certain, however, is that working on the group's aspirations, difficulties, troubles, issues, or other concerns following such an experience, is remarkable. We don't generally seem to have much faith in the idea that the dream (like a story, like art of any sort) can engender its effects all by itself. We seem addicted to the idea that for the dream to have its effect it must be interpreted and explained. </p>\n\n<p>This would be like insisting that a poem always be published with its explanation, a painting always viewed along side its critique. That is nonsense. The whole point of the poem, art, and yes, the dream too, is to \"get through,\" to achieve some conception in the psyche of its audience. It is what happens next that is crucial, not what we say about it, but what it engenders in us as response from our own depth. A dream wants a dream. A poem wants a poem. This nexus of relationship: dream to dream, poem to poem, painting to painting, is largely unexplored territory. What did you dream in response to those \"naked\" dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em>?</p>\n\n<p>It's something like the above that leads me to imagine a future in which the dream once again takes on a value and role even in the centers of power. Is such a thing possible? As I watch the leaders of the world gathered together in a truly extraordinary way at Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, how I would love for them to sit circled with one another and with nothing else as agenda, simply tell the images from their dreams, round and round, until they feel that dimensionality of alterity. Such experience could become a basis for experiencing what \"the source\" has to say about what needs to be manifested in the future. In this, they and others would discover that the basis of their rejection of \"the other\" in human form, is a result of not genuinely experiencing \"the other\" in mythic form. All true experience of the mythic dimension generates an eros of inclusiveness. The failure of this generates the power of exclusiveness and becomes the secret source of the ubiquity and power of prejudice.</p>\n\n<h2>VII. Dream as Subversive</h2>\n\n<p>In these times there is, on occasion, a yearning for something that truly punctures our consciousness, something that breaks through the increasingly addictive fog of image-driven consumerist miasma. Occasionally, world events (atrocities, assassinations, natural calamities), often times local events (killings close to home, the rage at horrific secrets revealed), sometimes personal experiences (a sudden loss, a reversal, a tragedy) break through this fog. Still, so much of this is now mediated by media, rather than direct experience, that its shock value, its potential of penetration, is lessening remarkably in our lifetime. It's as if we could arrive very shortly, perhaps more shortly than we care to imagine, at having TV cameras showing us bodies being delivered to the ovens, or the killing fields, while we sit silently couched to inaction, hungering for the next scene. When reality becomes entertainment what then? </p>\n\n<p>Today, we are double yoked to insatiable work and endless entertainment. Underlying all of this is the commodification of desire. This is what is whipping us along. I continue to believe that the last holdout to this process, that which will retain the power to puncture our increasing insensibility, will be the dream. I continue to believe that the dream will be the last resistance to the devouring dynamics of money. And because of this, we may be edging close to a time when it will be a crime to dream and there will be every effort made to control this uncontrollable access to a source beyond the world of power. The dream is always subversive of the status quo, particularly the big dream. The dream will always be outlaw, always alien. At some point the dream will threaten the established order, as that order becomes ever more rigid and confined. As more and more of the population becomes medicated as a means of coping with the increasing density of events and their demands on our time and attention, the dream will begin to fade away as is the fate of dreams under most medications.</p>\n\n<p>Power will attempt to appropriate the dream. Already this appropriation is happening in language where \"dream\" is now the buzzword in advertisement. Listen to this add for Compuserve: \"What do you dream of doing? Does it involve work? Or travel? Or your children? Is your dream to create something? Or go somewhere? Or meet someone? Is it a big overwhelming dream? Or just a tiny dream the size of your baby? Is understanding a part of your dream? Is joy? Is fun? No matter what you dream of, go online with Compuserve. Maybe if you had ten free hours on our online service, you could get that fat, lazy dream off the ground.\" Watch for how dream increasingly is used in relation to money, possession, and power. </p>\n\n<h2>VIII. Embracing the Future</h2>\n\n<p>Dreams are not \"about\" the past at all; instead they are the psyche's way of <em>preparing</em> the future. Not preparing for the future, but preparing the future. So a dream does not \"predict\" the future so much as it is a thread from which the future is woven. It is not that there is a future fixed and immutable that incarnates itself inevitably, nor some pre-design that is rolling out like clockworks; rather, the future is prepared as a cooking, a weaving, and these things we call dreams are as if tasting a dish in preparation, a weaving in the making. Are these the futures we want? Are we free to choose? What part can we play consciously?</p>\n\n<p>What is privileged, then, in my view, is the dream. We mortgage our future when we mobilize our energies only to re-birthing the past. We are coming to a time of the bankruptcy of these methodologies -the old psychologies of the dream. The past is known (or we like to think so) and is therefore secure and provides us with limits within which to operate. The future is insecure (and cannot be predicted) and so we try to reduce it inevitably to the knownness of the past. We see the future only as an extension of the past and therefore we are secure in the legitimacy of privileging the past as the source of our facing the future. </p>\n\n<p>But what if this is not so? Let us imagine that different futures are possible from the same past and that it takes only a minor variation to lead to a profound bifurcation with the past.... and that the source of that \"minor variation\" is pictured to us in those experiences we call dreams, particularly big dreams. So it would be what we \"construct\" with the guidance of the big dream, how we enact the big dream that will yield a rich new way of leading us into the future. </p>\n\n<p>That is why I so value what we have begun here in <em>Dream Network</em>. The raw dream, dream brut, is the most powerful antidote I can imagine to the not so subtle and escalating fascism throughout the world, that seeks increasingly to control our thought and soul. We must take solace and inspiration from the simple fact that no one will pay money for a dream. Dreams are freely given to us and must be freely given in return. </p>\n\n<p>The community that learns to operate on the basis of the circulating gift of dreams will be the community immune to the commodification of desire that so threatens the true potential of the human spirit. </p>\n\n<p>I'd like to know what these dreams and thoughts have stirred in you, so by all means, whether in shouts or whispers, let me know.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

After earning a B.A. in accounting and an MBA, she became a public accountant, then changed careers to education as an associate professor of accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. In 2000, Duesbury\u2019s master of counselor education thesis, \u201CUtilizing Dreams from a Systemic Perspective to Understand and Mollify Relationship Issues,\u201D received the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater\u2019s Outstanding Thesis Award. Since that time Duesbury and colleagues researched and explored her thesis-based Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID) for seven additional projects. During those years, Duesbury developed and taught a distance education course to counselors on how to use her PMID model. The course guide that she wrote for her distance education class is the foundation for The Counselor\u2019s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams: Family and Other Relationship Systems Perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>Before writing The Counselor\u2019s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams Duesbury worked on other projects. First, with assistance from her son, a writer, and consultation from E. B. Bynum, a clinical psychologist, Duesbury published a self-help book for the general population titled Living Dreams, Living Life, a Practical Guide to Understanding Your Dreams and How They Can Change Your Waking-Life. One night, after thinking about updating her distance education course guide, she thought to herself, \u201CI am so occupied that I am unable to give time to my own dreams the way I want.\u201D The next morning she woke with a dream that persuaded her to put her plans of working exclusively with her own dreams on hold. In the dream, her former accounting advisor suggested (in dream language) that she should transform her distance counseling course book into a \u201Cuniversal systems book.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>In waking-life several years earlier, an advisor had told Duesbury he had taken several positions to prepare him to do what he loves, teach. Duesbury likewise discovered that she loves to teach. She loves to show others how to use their dreams to improve their lives.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfredb> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfredb-0.jpg\" alt=\"READING THE RED BOOK, Spring Journal Books, 317 pp\" /></p>\n\n<p><!--nopreview--><div style=\"text-align:center\"><i>READING THE RED BOOK, Spring Journal Books, 317 pp</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>\n\n<p>When The Red Book of Carl Gustav Jung was published, it caused an immense stir, offering readers a plethora of new mysteries and depth psychology insights. I cannot predict that this interpretation will set so large a wave of interest in motion, but it may. <strong>READING THE RED BOOK</strong> certainly deserves attention. It is a work of wealth in itself. And you may find it of interest that the author confesses not to be a Jungian and yet he uses Jung\u2019s often idiosyncratic spiritual quest\u2014for soul, Self and the God-yet-to-come\u2014to confront and challenge the materialist psychology dominating our materialistic society\u2019s science of mind and soul. </p>\n\n<p>From the onset, Sanford Drob is clear about what he has done and how he has done it. Beginning at the Introduction, it is worth listening into the author as he explains his intention. Drob\u2019s first paragraph is this: \u201CJung held that dreams are challenges to the assumptions and complacency of the ego, compensation for one-sided conscious attitudes, or messages from the unconscious that prompt us to question the value and direction of our current mode of thinking, feeling and living. By this defi nition, Jung\u2019s The Red Book...is akin to a dream... Like many dreams the <em>dream</em> that is The Red Book is at once magnificent and grotesque.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>A page later, the author sets before us the major points of his investigation: \u201CAlthough I have endeavored to be balanced and as comprehensive as possible... I have become convinced that while The Red Book narrative centers around Jung\u2019s\u2019 soul-finding journey, its greatest value may be its ideas on such themes as God, humanity, madness, chaos, death, science, reason, knowledge, logic, and evil.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Drob introduces us to a confession, his method, and his intention. He continues: \u201CI am not a Jungian. While I believe that my treatment of The Red Book is a sympathetic one, I do not hesitate to raise questions about Jung\u2019s approach to various issues and his suggestion that spiritual wisdom and enlightenment must involve an inner, solitary journey. In many instances, without providing anything resembling an answer, I raise questions that the reader will want to consider for him or herself.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>Drob concludes his informative Introduction with the following lines: \u201CThe immense size and weight of the facile edition, along with the haunting beauty and mystery of its illustrations leads one to approach Jung\u2019s Red Book with a certain caution\u2014it is hardly the sort of work that one curls up with in bed\u2026 and yet it is a work that, above all else, must be read; read, and then studied and reflected upon\u2026 In the present work, I propose to read The Red Book, and, in the course of this reading, wrestle with the questions it asks, *on the hope of experiencing something new, seeing life from a new perspective and perhaps being personally transformed in the process.\u201D *</p>\n\n<p>Sanford Drob is thorough in his investigative exploration of The Red Book\u2019s Psyche Odyssey of CG Jung: an interior journey, an intellectual, emotional, spiritual going down into the depths\u2014even Jung\u2019s descent into personal hell, madness, chaos\u2014to seek the alchemic matrix that brews the dynamics of individuation, the nexus of soul and self, and to search out the Unknown God who addresses emergent identity through the individuation process. One major result of this Odyssey is what Dr. Drob comes to refer to as \u201Cdream theology,\u201D rendered out of The Red Book journey as dream... a dream of human psychology, which came to provide fertile ground for Jung\u2019s psychology of dreams and dreaming. </p>\n\n<p>Drob is also thorough in his routing back over Jung\u2019s dreamlike rite of passage. Unfortunately, I cannot be so as a reviewer and must yield to the limitations of my spatial condition. Let me but cite several passages from the cornucopia of <strong>READING THE RED BOOK.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.3:</strong> \u201CJung\u2019s goal in The Red Book was to encourage others to discover their own soul and assume responsibility for their own lives.\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.5:</strong> \u201CJung\u2019s discussion of the spirit of the depths raises the question of whether there is...a form of gnosis that is not conditioned by time and place... It is the quest for such a trans-temporal, trans-cultural... understanding that fueled Jung\u2019s early interest in mythology and conditioned his inquiries into the archetypes of the collective unconscious.\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.6:</strong> \u201CFor Jung, the supreme meaning, which gives rise to the image of the God-yet-to-come, is the melding together of meaning and absurdity, sense and nonsense.\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.22:</strong> \u201CJung asserts that meaninglessness and chaos is the \u2018other half of the world,\u2019 and no one can be complete or have a full understanding of the world without embracing its chaotic and meaningless elements.\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.23:</strong> \u201CThe descent into chaos is perilous, but it also yields great reward.\u201D <strong>(Jung)</strong> \u2018If we open up to chaos, magic also arises .\u2019\u201D</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.29:</strong> \u201CIn Rudolph Otto\u2019s terms, Jung seeks a numinous experience, an experience of the mysterium, that fearful yet fascinating and aweinspiring rapture that lifts one from the despair of the everyday and allows one to experience self and the world as bathed in the darkness of terror and/or the light of wonder, awe, and spiritual affirmation.\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>P.260:</strong> \u201CThe Red Book has many characteristics that are typically associated with dreams: it is filled with strange, haunting and at times frightening images; its narrative is surreal and, most importantly, it arrives into our awareness in a manner that is completely discontinuous and disruptive of our business...as usual\u201D </p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong> the individuation process, with connectives between soul, Self and an emergent God-image and in its dream-actuals and dreamlike episodes, disrupts established patterns of identity for the coming into being of mature identities, through dialectic developments and revelatory dialogues. The dream of The Red Book parents the work of depth psychology; out of the depths emerge contours of a dream theology. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zmythd> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Familiar themes and symbols emerge to most people who record their dreams. They are components that parallel their lives above and below conscious awareness. Do these themes and symbols form pieces of your own mythology? Since dreams dip into the world of the unconscious to select their stories and dramas, they tap both the personal and collective unconscious for dream material, thus forming a unique relationship between your personal mythology and your dreams. </p>\n\n<p>What is the definition of \"myth\"? Webster defines it as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...a traditional story of ostensible historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief or natural phenomenon.\" [1] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do your dreams reveal your world view? Certainly, your personal history is reflected through your dreams in regard the content you select from your life activities to play out in your dreams. Thus, your dreams reflect your personal 'myths' - ones in which your personal relationship can change and transform, just as your life experiences do. </p>\n\n<p>However, the collective unconscious component adds a deeper layer to the meaning of your dreams with the appearances of the archetypal themes and symbols which reflect the primitive and ancient part of your personal mythology: Arthur Cotterell explains that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The myth in a primitive society ... was the recognition of the link between past and present established by myth in daily life. ...Jung became convinced that the individual possessed both a personal and collective unconscious; the former filled with material peculiar to the individual whereas the latter housed the common mental inheritance of mankind - the archetypes, or primordial images which 'bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote past. This psychic life .. is the mind of our ancient ancestors, the way in which they conceived of life and the world, of gods and human being.' ... No doubt the creative period of myth is set in prehistoric times.'' [2] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can you track your own personal mythology through your dreams? Those who have kept dream journals for more than five years will have ample material to process; begin by reading through them finding frequent images/scenarios that you notice. Jot them down and see how your world view/ psyche has changed, remained the same or intensified - is it a map for the evolution of your own life pattern? Have your myths outgrown you - or you them? But no matter how long you have journaled - whether a novice recording the magic of the dream world or one who is well-seasoned, you will be able to recognize the emergence of your own myth material. </p>\n\n<p>For example, several of my older dream themes had to do with hotel/motel settings; that is, temporary way stations on a journey to somewhere. It reflected my internal as well as external search for \"home\". Since I have found what I call home both within and in the physical world , the occurrence of a hotel or motel setting in my dreams generally has diminished. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been an increase in circular-shaped symbols in my dreams during the past few years. For me, this equates to the archetype of the integration process of the self wanting to coalesce and evolve through internal processes. </p>\n\n<p>In <em>Personal Mythology</em>, Feinstein and Krippner further explain the personal mythology process: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Many depth psychologists believe that dreams are best understood as an unfolding of the psyche and should not be distorted by intellectual interpretations. In a similar manner, you can learn to sense, without being overly intellectual, the relationship between patterns you find in your dreams and developing personal myths. Dreams serve to mediate between your daily experiences and your underlying myths, Working with your dreams can reveal changes in your mythology that are occurring outside your awareness. Dreams may support or challenge an existing myth ... and you can understand your personal mythology more fully through the instructions [symbols] of your dreams.\" [3] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I encourage you to examine your own dream material in this light of mythmaking; it is a template for you to observe the smaller and bigger picture of your life as it evolves through developmental stages and reveals the inner and outer journey of the self. </p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary. ed., G. &amp; C.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfpeac> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201CNothing happens unless first a dream.\u201D - Carl Sandburg</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to talk to you about <em>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</em>, my current dreaming project. In order to do so it is necessary to first give you a little background about myself and about the fairly unique dreamwork process in which I have involved myself over the past thirty years or so. </p>\n\n<h2>Some History</h2>\n\n<p>I was fortunate that fairly early in my career in that I was asked to direct a small, non-profit organization in Virginia Beach, Virginia, called Poseidia Institute. At that time, the focus of research was on the intuitive process \u2014 what made people able to do such things as accurate psychic readings(?), for example. What made it possible for \u2018healers\u2019 to \u2018cure\u2019 and \u2018telepaths\u2019 to give information for someone halfway around the world? </p>\n\n<p>Because these questions were primary to my own research as well, it quickly became clear to me that dreams \u2014 whatever else they may be \u2014 are the one altered state of consciousness we all share. Therefore, talking to people about dreaming might reduce the general awe in which psychics and psychic phenomena were held, that is when they were not being denied or ridiculed. </p>\n\n<p>So I began with the premise that we are all psychic, that being psychic is our nature. It wasn\u2019t long before the necessity to examine the nature of time and space became important to me as well, since the psychics I knew often talked about alternate realities, or other areas of time and space. </p>\n\n<p>These were interesting times in the field of dreams, during the 1970s. John Herbert, Richard Wilkerson and others summed some of that history up in articles in the last issue of Dream Network. </p>\n\n<p>On the East Coast, Dr. Henry Reed was publishing his <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> for the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE). This journal served the function of bringing dreamers into dialogue. So popular was this quarterly journal that, when the ARE stopped its production, a New Yorker by the name of Bill Stimson decided that something needed to be done to keep the grassroots dream community going. He was so convinced, that he started a small publication of his own, the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, which was an immediate precursor of the Dream Network you now hold in your hand. </p>\n\n<p>The staff of Posiedia Institute was involved in these events, with other editors of the DNB, Suzanne Keyes, and Linda Magallon. We were all volunteers in a project we called <em>\u2018Dreams to the Tenth Power\u2019</em>, a group dreaming experiment. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time Henry was publishing the <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em>, he was also conducting his <em>Dream Helper</em> experiments, a process he had devised for getting people incubate dreams to help another dreamer. </p>\n\n<p>In conversation one day, Henry and I decided it might be interesting to see if dream helpers could work with someone they\u2019d never met, or met only briefly. So it was determined that the next person who filled out an application for a psychic reading from one of Poseidia\u2019s staff of very competent psychics would be, if they were willing, the target for a Dream Helper experiment. </p>\n\n<p>The majority of people coming to Poseidia for readings at that time were there for medical assistance, often referred by their doctor or therapist. So when the next application arrived, we invited the young woman to participate in this joint ARE/Poseidia Institute experiment. </p>\n\n<p>What occurred to me the next morning, when the \u2018dream helpers\u2019 met to report their dreams\u2014myself among them\u2014was that not only had several members of the group accurately targeted the young woman\u2019s illness, but the dreamers actually appeared to have shared dreams.</p>\n\n<p>This subject of sharing dreams fascinated me so much that I decided to devise some sort of experiment to see if people could share dreams, possibly even lucid dreams, on a planned basis. This was the beginning of a set of experiments which took place over several years. The results of these experiments more than convinced me that spontaneous mutual dreaming is fairly common, though not so commonly reported; I was also convinced that skills such as mutual, and even mutual lucid, dreaming can be developed.</p>\n\n<p>It was out of this background then that I returned in 1996 to The Association for the Study of Dreams. As one of ASD\u2019s earliest members, I had presented at the second ASD conference in Charlottesville, Virginia, but then left dreamwork behind for doctoral work at American University, and later for work as a senior Science Fiction/ Fantasy editor. </p>\n\n<h2>We\u2019ll Cross That Bridge When We Come To It</h2>\n\n<p>So how does all of that bring us to the World Dreams Peace Bridge?</p>\n\n<p>The period between 1985 and 1995 was very important to the study of dreams. In California, Linda Magallon continued the study of mutual and group dreams, finally resulting in her book, <em>Mutual Dreaming</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1997. Interest in dream lucidity continued to grow, supported by activities like Ruth Sacksteder\u2019s Lucid Dream Exchange. </p>\n\n<p>Although there continued to be an interest in both interpretive dreamwork and theoretical dream research, dreamers were also becoming interested in such things as Dr. Stanley Krippner\u2019s ongoing research into Shamanic dream practices around the world, and the work of Australian author, Robert Moss. These researchers and others were talking about the important role dreaming has played in world cultures, apart from the more scientific models of Western culture.</p>\n\n<p>I have often told the story of sitting at a table overlooking the ocean on the terrace of the beautiful University of California Santa Cruz campus, with a group of some of the top experts on dream lucidity. Someone asked how people had first become lucid. One man responded, holding up his hands, \u201CI looked at my hands.\u201D One by one, around the table, people grinned and held their hands in front of their faces in silent homage to Carlos Castaneda who, even if he made it all up, introduced an entire generation of dreamers to lucidity through <em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em>. </p>\n\n<p>During the decade in which I was away from dreamwork, more dreamers had become conversant with theories of time and space presented first by Albert Einstein, followed by an entire group of nuclear physicists and popularized by writers such as Gary Zukov, Michael Talbot, and Fred Alan Wolf. Now it was not so unusual as it had once been for dreamers to believe that possibly consciousness\u2014particularly dreaming consciousness\u2014could extend beyond the boundaries of linear time and cross the boundaries of space. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201CIn the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace.\u201D </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Possibly the single most important development of the decade was the Internet, where almost as soon as longdistance communication was possible, dreamworkers like the Rev. Jeremy Taylor, John Herbert, Jayne Gackenbach, and Richard Wilkerson were communicating globally with dreamers around the world and constructing Internet dream resources which far outshone anything available to dreamers prior to that time. </p>\n\n<p>When I returned to ASD in 1996, almost the first thing I did was volunteer to moderate the Online Bulletin Board at http://www.asdreams.org. I was fascinated by the potential of the Internet to link dreamers with one another and to provide instant communication. Whereas before, when the <em>\u2018Dreams to the Tenth Power\u2019</em> research was going on, weeks of sending dream accounts and responses through the mail were discouraging to dreamers. Now communication was instantaneous, free... with the click of a key. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as I began to moderate the Online Bulletin Board, I noticed one less-than-surprising thing: a majority of the questions\u2014from kids writing school papers, from adults with sleep disorders, from dreamers all over the globe\u2014focused on subjects which, heretofore, had been classified under \u2018paranormal\u2019 dreaming or \u2018anomalous\u2019 dreams. There were questions about out-of-body experiences, about dream telepathy, about mutual dreams and experiences of sleep paralysis. It seemed that this type of dreaming, far from being paranormal, was \u2014 if we were to believe the people who came to the Bulletin Board \u2014 very normal indeed. </p>\n\n<p>The visitors to the Bulletin Board, some of whom became so regular that we began to call them Boarders, carried on the practice of grassroots dreamwork which began in the seventies. Even though dream interpretation is not done on the Bulletin Board, wideranging questions about dreaming and dreamwork are discussed, with equal participation from therapists, sleep and dream researchers, artists as well as from dreamers themselves. </p>\n\n<p>In the two years after I began moderating the Bulletin Board, Ed Kellogg developed the Paranormal Dreaming Forum on the ASD site, and we began also to create ASD Member Pages, which allowed for members to put up a page online, introducing themselves and their work. It was not long until I conceived a plan for bringing International members even closer, through the medium of the Internet. In 1998, I invited ASD members around the world to participate in the construction of the Online Guide to International Dream Work. This project not only provided a stunning array of multi-language pages for the ASD web site, but it also built a feeling of camaraderie among the ASD members working on the project, even though they lived in Greece, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and many places in between.</p>\n\n<h2>The Effects of 9/11</h2>\n\n<p>Given my sensitivity to the issues of interest to the online dream community, it wasn\u2019t much of a stretch for me, when I saw the televised report of the second plane flying into the Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, to go to the computer and invite people to post their dreams and feelings to the Bulletin Board. I saw the number of precognitive dream reports without surprise and before long I was writing an article called \u201CDealing With Precognitive Dreamer Guilt,\u201D <a href=\"http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm\">http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm</a>, which Richard Wilkerson generously published in his online magazine <a href=\"http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm\">Electric Dreams</a>. I was touched by the outpouring of sympathy and understanding, which came to the U.S. from dreamers around the globe. </p>\n\n<p>Then, as the bombs began dropping in Afghanistan, two of my lifelong interests came together with a very loud click. I have been a pacifist ever since, as a graduate student in the 1960s, I did Conscientious Objector counseling for the American Friends Service Committee. </p>\n\n<p>I remembered the plenary speech Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, director of Pacifica Graduate Institute, made at the 1999 ASD Conference in Santa Cruz: <em>\u2018Dreaming the World.\u2019</em> That lecture caught my attention because Aizenstat was saying what I had believed for years: that people, and all sentient beings, are dreaming the world into existence, all the time. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a new idea, having been the foundation for Aboriginal Australian culture for thousands of years, as well as fundamental to other indigenous cultures. Numerous psychics, such as Edgar Cayce and Jane Roberts, have said the same thing. </p>\n\n<p>In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace. </p>\n\n<h2>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</h2>\n\n<p>In October of 2001, I sent an e-mail to approximately one hundred people: friends, family, those ASD members who had worked on the Online Guide to International Dream Work, inviting them to join me in a discussion group, which I later labeled the first-ever longterm group journaling experiment. There was something that had struck me in my own briefly precognitive dream on the morning of 9/11. In that dream, <em>I was standing in the control tower of an airport, watching as an air traffic control person dealt with an obvious emergency.</em></p>\n\n<p>What struck me about the dream was that, although I was in the control tower, I was only an observer. My dream reminded me that I had the ability to respond, a response-ability to be in control, as we all do if we believe that we are dreaming the world. </p>\n\n<p>In the last issue of <em>Dream Network</em>, Richard Wilkerson labeled this emerging attitude as Dream Activism. In fact, there are other groups now following the model of the World Dreams Peace Bridge, and there are a growing number of dream activists. Is this a new concept? Not entirely. During the time between the emergence of \u2018grass roots\u2019 dreamwork and today, many dreamers have recognized that \u2014 from a certain position in the dream, often a lucid dream, and sometimes a group or mutual dream \u2014 it is possible to act consciously from the dream state, to communicate with others and to participate in creating the magic of reality. </p>\n\n<p>The World Dreams Peace Bridge, which maintains an active membership of around fifty people, is composed of dreamers from around the world: Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, New Zealand, the U.S. and many other places. In its waking form, as a discussion group, the Peace Bridge operates as a support system for dreamers. New ideas are explored; dreams are told; because of its international membership, news is often reported from one country or another before it is picked up by the press. </p>\n\n<p>At the dreaming level, the World Dreams Peace Bridge has acted as a catalyst for creativity. One example of this is the Peace Train Project, which has grown from a dream Jeremy Seligson dreamed in Korea in August 2002. </p>\n\n<p>In the dream, <em>Jeremy was riding with a group of people on a train across the country. The train, which bore a banner calling it the \u2018Peace Train,\u2019 ended up at a platform on which President Gore stood.</em></p>\n\n<p>From the dream, when he first recounted it, Jeremy began to muse. What would happen if people all over the world began to create peace trains? What would happen if children were asked to create peace trains? What would peace trains carry? </p>\n\n<p>Other members of the group began to get enthused and now\u2014less than a year later\u2014Peace Train projects and Peace Train workshops have been held or are planned for Korea, Australia, India, Turkey and the United States. UNESCO has praised the Peace Train Project. Jeremy has created a Peace Train song and is working on a video. There will be a Peace Train workshop at the ASD Conference in Berkeley in June. And the Peace Train Project has brought more dreamers to the Peace Bridge. </p>\n\n<p>By the fall of 2002, the World Dreams Peace Bridge had become so active that we needed to create a web site. With the work of webmistress, Liz Diaz\u2014who had already designed a beautiful World Dreams logo\u2014<a href=\"https://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org/\">http://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org</a> was created. The site, among other things, now houses a marvelous collection of art, which has grown out of the dreams of various peace dreamers. </p>\n\n<p>Most recently, in the time just preceding massive world-wide peace demonstrations against U.S. attempts to convince the United Nations to approve war against Iraq, members of the World Dreams Peace Bridge sponsored a Peaceful Solutions Dream In, inviting not just members of the Peace Bridge but dreamers everywhere to join us in attempting to dream up peaceful solutions to the world\u2019s conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>In my own estimation, these are good questions for all dreamers to consider, not just dream activists. In the work I was doing at Poseidia Institute in the 1970s, I was often told that I was ahead of my time. Recently, when I helped to facilitate ASD\u2019s first PsiberDreaming Online Conference, an online psi event that had participants asking for more, I was told that my first book on dreams, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, published in 1980, had withstood the test of time. But, for myself, I have seen Dream Activism as a natural development, an outgrowth of believing that dreams might predict the future or support such things as lucid/mutual communication. </p>\n\n<p>Much has happened in the past thirty years to convince Western dreamers that we might be creating the world (or many worlds) through our dreams. Dream Activism, or projects like those of The World Dreams Peace Bridge, are no more than our attempt to become increasingly more conscious of what we already know to be possible. \u2118</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zlucse> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>\"Freud is right,\" I said to myself, somewhat incredulous as the psychology professor explained the id and the libido. \"Freud is right,\" I said again and shook my head. It was 1980 and I was a psychology major at Drake University listening to a lecture on Freud's theory of the id, ego, superego and the libido. The instructor had outlined Freud's theory that the id-or the vast unconscious within one's psyche-was the source of the libido, the sexually based instinctual energy that fueled much of motivation and behavior. </p>\n\n<p>At that moment, I felt Freud had illuminated an interesting aspect of my lucid dreaming-that the feeling of extraordinary energy when conscious in the dream. I reasoned that-if the dream state was located in the id or unconscious-then, when lucid, one was exploring the unconscious with one's conscious awareness. Freud's theory would seemingly predict that a dreaming person, in their id or unconscious, would definitely experience the libido energy. I thought back to my first five years of lucid dreaming experiences and recalled the incredible surge of energy that occurs when lucid-that deep, intense, sometimes ecstatic, often sexual, energy streaming through my awareness. I could only conclude that Freud might be on to something. </p>\n\n<p>But what were others experiencing in their lucid dreams? Was this ecstatic energy common in lucid dreams? Or was it just me, a 20 year old junior in college with possible raging hormones and a penchant for lucid dreaming? </p>\n\n<p>\"Orgasm is a natural part of lucid dreaming,\" proclaimed Dr. Patricia Garfield in her fascinating book <em>Pathway to Ecstasy: The Way of the Dream Mandala</em>, first published in 1979. Drawing upon many of her lucid dream experiences with bold frankness and a penetrating eye for detail, she went on to write, \"in fully two thirds of my lucid dreams, I feel the flow of sexual energy; this arousal culminates in an orgasmic burst on about half of those occasions.\" </p>\n\n<p>Garfield's book unabashedly acknowledged a common denominator in lucid dreaming; namely that the shift from dreaming to conscious or lucid dreaming was normally accompanied by a special, energetic, inner feeling which often was ultimately directed by the dreamer to sexual expression. Lucid dreamers would often write, \"I know I am dreaming. I want to have fun. Feeling amorous, I look down an empty street and desire a man. Suddenly I see a man ....\"</p>\n\n<p>What else might explain this desire for sexual expression? In lucid dreams, the senses are often very acute and vivid. Touching often seems hypersensitive. Coupled with a feeling of energy and freedom, this tactile intensity may encourage further sensuousness or sex. Also in lucid dreams, one is aware of safety, ensconced in a creation of ones own making. Directing the action to pleasurable activities is easily achieved and often free from waking or moralistic concerns. One lucid dreamer's fantasy: \"I realized I was dreaming and stepped into the school room. I saw there were a few women there. Feeling amorous, I decided to announce that I wanted to see more attractive women when I re-entered the room. I stepped out into the hallway, shut the door and waited. I reopened the door with a definite feeling of expectation. A line of attractive nude women stood looking back at me. It was amazing!\" </p>\n\n<p>Of course in many lucid dreams, there is no overt or apparent covert sexual action or imagery or only a part may be directed to sexual expression. The majority of the lucid dream may be directed to exploring the lucid dream state: flying, transforming dream object or events, talking to dream characters, or predetermined goals of the lucid dreamer. </p>\n\n<p>Experienced lucid dreamers learn to contravene the sexual component for two basic reasons. They learn that excessive emotions can terminate a lucid dream. Therefore intense sexual feelings may cause lucidity to end, much like overloading -a circuit breaker. An example illustrates this: \"I pulled her close and could feel her breasts as I reached under her sweater. But then the emotional intensity was building and I could tell that the lucid dream was about to end.\"</p>\n\n<p>Second, a lucid dreamer may have a particular goal in mind, actively choosing to ignore a sexual situation. One lucid dreamer wrote, \"I brush against one of the women as I stand up, then I realize that this is a lucid dream! I look at my hands for a moment to stabilize things. As I look up again, one of the women is now wearing only underwear. I ignore her because I have a desire to experiment. I see the wall in front of me with old wallpaper and decide to walk through it and experience that as I do so, I have a funny perception, kind of a half second of 'brown vision,' which I assume is my visualization of the wall internally.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Flying, Sex and Ecstasy</h2>\n\n<p>Most experienced lucid dreamers agree that some degree of sexual activity occurs in many lucid dreams. An informal survey found that their favorite activity when lucid was flying; sexual expression was their second.</p>\n\n<p>Freud drew a linkage to flying as a dream symbol for sexual expression in his book The Interpretation of Dreams. Reflecting upon childhood 'romping' and the giddy excitement of being swung about by adults, Freud concluded, \"Not infrequently in these motion games, innocuous in themselves, sexual feelings will be aroused\". Is there a connection between flying and sex in lucid dreams? It may be an association with ecstasy- \"a state of exalted delight in which normal understanding is felt to be surpassed\" -or from the Greek, ek-stasis, \"to displace, drive out one's senses\". Lucid dreams are in some sense ecstatic; they jar us out of \"stasis' or standstill. They shift our consciousness. They force us into a new awareness that provides the energy to express freedom, intensity and joy in a symbolic way, such as flying, sexual union or transcendental experiences. </p>\n\n<p>I found that Patricia Garfield reached a similar conclusion, \"...we are stimulating an area of the brain or a chain of responses that is associated with ecstatic states of all sorts. Sensations of flying, sexual heights, acute pleasurable awareness, and a sense of oneness are all natural outcomes of a prolonged lucid dream.\" This sense of ecstasy may generalize to a number of diverse but highly pleasurable dream behaviors or actions, linked through inner associational processes. </p>\n\n<h2>Symbolism in Lucid Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Although the lucid dreamer's sexual activities are normally consciously directed by their conscious intent, other parts of the dream (the setting, the atmosphere, the action of the dream characters) are not typically consciously directed but simply accepted by the lucid dreamer. This suggests that the symbolic function of a dream continues in the background, while accommodating the consciously directed activities of the lucid dreamer. This lucid dreamers' account may express this:</p>\n\n<p><em>I am wearing a long, red slip dress over a white top ... and marveling at such a wonderful dream scene. I still want sex. I go through the house looking for someone. I even go down to the basement... I see a light coming from the furnace area.</em></p>\n\n<p>The red dress may symbolically express, fashion-wise, this lucid dreamer's sexual urge, though it wasn't consciously chosen. Similarly, the light coming from the furnace area may suggest the dreamer's heat, fire, or passion. The dream continues:</p>\n\n<p><em>I look out the front door and see R ... I know it is a dream version of R so it's okay to have sex with him ... I tell him let's go down there, as I point to the brook area and the tall reeds ... I lay floating supported by the reeds ... I hope Dad can't see me out the window ... I remind myself that I'm dreaming and it doesn't matter who sees. R may not even be there anymore but I experience an orgasm anyway.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zlucse-0.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid couple among the reeds\" width=\"400px\"/></p>\n\n<p>The setting of tall reeds and brook may symbolically reflect the sexual action.</p>\n\n<p>In many lucid dream accounts, one reads of the dreamer wrestling with where to have their sexual activity: in the open, in the closet, with no one present, with many others present, etc., all of which may have symbolic significance. One lucid dreamer felt his experience shed 'light' on his inner feelings:</p>\n\n<p><em>I was lucid, and seemed to be in an attic with Jots of boxes and chests around. For some reason the lighting was very dim, and shadowy. I saw a woman there, and knowing this was a dream, decided to have sex with her. In the next moment. her clothing was gone and she was looking towards me as she sat on the floor with her legs open. As I moved closer. I may have been thinking about the darkness for a second and then the oddest thing happened, a shaft of light from above shone down directly upon her vaginal It was like a theatrical stage light had suddenly turned on. Boom! It totally lit up with a brilliant white light! I laughed with delight.</em></p>\n\n<p>The dreamer felt the scene in the attic may have reflected his thinking about issues of sex and spirituality.</p>\n\n<h2>Lucidity, Sex and Physiology</h2>\n\n<p>Garfield also hints that there may possibly be a physiological component in lucid dreaming and sex. Later, research reported by Dr. Stephen LaBerge in his book Lucid Dreaming, states that \"lucid dreaming occurs during a highly activated phase of REM sleep, associated, as a result, with increased vaginal blood flow or penile erections.\" While this is an interesting point, one can only wonder if the physiological event is being driven by the dream cognitions or if the dream cognitions are an artifact of physiological activities. </p>\n\n<p>In a separate 1983 sleep laboratory study, LaBerge asked a female lucid dreamer to signal through rapid eye-movements that she was lucid dreaming, and then signal when she was nearing orgasm in the lucid dream. The physiological measures of heightened respiration, and vaginal muscle activity and pulse amplitude matched her lucid dream signaling. This indicated that the sexual dream content was reflected in physiological changes. In many ways, the experience was 'real,' mentally and physiologically. This study suggests to me that the dream cognitions drive the physiology. </p>\n\n<p>Twenty-six years ago when I first began to dream consciously or lucidly at age 16, my very first lucid dreams did not have sexual elements in them. What they had, however, was an extraordinary sense of near ecstasy -- a deep swelling sense of energy, feelings of complete and utter freedom, and an astounding visual and mental clarity. These ecstatic feelings were often most acute when flying. </p>\n\n<p>When talking with other lucid dreamers about their first lucid dream, no one has ever mentioned sex in their first lucid dream. However, many have mentioned a feeling of near ecstasy and joy, often accompanied by flying. At some later point, most lucid dreamers learn they can direct the energy of the dream towards sexual expressions. </p>\n\n<p>These points may suggest that the energy felt in a lucid dream is an experience of a basic or universal creative energy with the sexual component being one part, which we learn through association or conscious desire to pursue. In a similar vein, Carl G. Jung broke with Freud's view of the libido as primarily sexual and came to view the libido as a psychic energy, an expression of the \"intensity of the psychic process.\" </p>\n\n<h2>Id, Ego, Libido, Lucidity: Why does it matter?</h2>\n\n<p>One hundred years ago Freud made an attempt to conceptualize the Psyche, how it was composed, how it functioned or dysfunctioned. He likened the conscious to the tip of an iceberg supported by a massive unconscious underneath. Dreams were very important in this schema, because dreams expressed symbolically the activity of the unconscious and shed light on one's motivations, perceptions and behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>One hundred years later, what do we really understand of the Psyche and the role of dreams in it? Robert Bosnak's book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>, explored this area. He strenuously questioned \"Who is the dreamer?\" in his attempt to understand the fantastic, awesome, incredible creativity of dreams and \"who\" was behind them. Similarly I ask \"Where is the dreamer? Where do we place the dreamer in our conception of the psyche?\" Moreover, \"If the dreamer is in the Unconscious, then where is the lucid dreamer?\" And finally, \"If the lucid dreamer is aware in the Unconscious, why do we not use lucid dreamers to begin to map out the characteristics of the Unconscious-the characteristics of the Psyche?\" </p>\n\n<p>The commonality of experience of lucid dreamers as they consciously act in the dreaming environment suggests that there may be a framework, a set of principles, of unconscious processes available in dreaming to be theorized and tested. If these principles could be explored and identified, then we could move beyond general conceptualizations and more clearly define the reality of the dream state and perhaps, the unconscious. </p>\n\n<p>As minister and dreamworker Jeremy Taylor has said many times, \"Dreams come to enhance our health and wholeness.\" All dreams, including lucid ones, are an opening to our wholeness. Let's find the dreamer. Let's claim our wholeness.  </p>\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Pathway to Ecstasy: The Way of the Dream Mandala by Patricia Garfield, 1979 p. 44 </p></li>\n<li><p>The Interpretation of Dreams (a new translation by Joyce Crick) by Sigmund Freud, 1999 p. 209 </p></li>\n<li><p>Garfield, p. 44. </p></li>\n<li><p>Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge, 1985 p. 142. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Basic Writings of C.G.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zmstar> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zmstar-0.jpg\" alt=\"Constellations\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are times when Dreams take us on unexplored roads to learn new things. Such is my case. Several years back I had dreams where I was specifically requested to look up information about the Constellation of Bootes and I did so. But, that\u2019s all I did; I learned a few details about what Astronomers knew then about Bootes and let it go recorded and forgotten into my dream journal. I didn\u2019t bother, at the time, to integrate any information about Bootes to anything pertinent in my life.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed and then I was again presented with the opportunity to learn something new, only this time it did not come as easily. I dreamt that...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I am talking with a wonderful middle-aged man who is obviously avery good friend of mine, even though in real life I do not know this person. We talk about our families and hobbies and then decide to take a walk. We walk for a while, then enter a restaurant and sit down to eat something. I look out the window closest to me and see some reflected shadowy movement. I standup, move in closer to take a good look and see two beautiful peacocks, red and shimmering in glowing red light. I am so enthralled with the view that I call out to my friend and tell him I am seeing two very eccentric, red peacocks shimmering in red light! My friend comes overfrom the table, looks at them,smiles and tells me, \u201CThey are not eccentric, this is the way they are supposed to be... and still are!\u201D</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I awoke that morning feeling very well but knowing that I had to go learn about the \u201Ctwo red peacocks.\u201DI knew the message inherent in the dream was important and decided to hit the search engines and see what I could come up with. I looked up \u201CPeacock\u201D in mythology and learned a lot in that area. I kept looking up the birds\u2019 habits and felt it was nice information but nothing that really made me feel that I had come uponthe right interpretation. Being bilingual, I placed the word \u201CPeacock\u201D in Spanish, \u201CPavo,\u201D and the Constellation of Pavo was displayed on the screen. As I read the description of the Constellation and learned it was made up of two very uneven but bright red primary and companion stars, I sensed that this was the information I was seeking.</p>\n\n<p>I translated most of the article into Spanish and emailed it to my study group in South America. The response came quickly. About two days later they advised me that the investigation for \u201CPavo\u201D was underway! They were to investigate and correlate some important spiritual facts about this constellation and they thanked me for the information. Needless to say that if I was confused at first on how to get information on the peacocks, I was evenmore confused when it was confirmed that the information received in my dream was correct and needed! It was a very powerful realization to learn how little knowledge I had of the heavens regarding Astronomical and Astrological points of view.</p>\n\n<p>This was the beginning of new work habits in my dream journals. Everytime I had a dream, I went straight to an astrological calendar and took a look at what was happening up there in the sky. I did not even know what I was looking for, but I took a tremendous leap of faith and knew that someone who did know about Astrology would show up and could interpret the symbols for me. From another magazine I looked up the \u201Cfixed star\u201D of the day and investigated the mythology behind that. This proved to be particularly helpful in understanding the \u201Chidden opinion\u201D behind the dream. I would then look up the Astronomer\u2019s favorite picture for the day on the internet and also wrote it down. Another great leap of faith; since I had begun to understand the interrelatedness of everything, I knew the Cosmos up there somehow had to resonate with what was happening down here... and that the Astronomer\u2019s sense of beauty would pick the right picture for the day.</p>\n\n<p>Writing it all down took time, great effort, research and some experimentation so as to learn what informationwas pertinent, but it was well worth the time. I also learned that I could not choose one science above the other, but had to learn \u201Cscientifically\u201C from Astronomy about the wonderful Universe that surrounds us as well as the ancient mythological interpretations that were given by Astrologers. All of these two areas were important and interrelated in my dreams. As I became more familiar with these areas, wonderful new revelations were opened to me. When researching the information, the dates coincided with happenings up in the skies and cosmos.</p>\n\n<p>The more familiar I became with Astronomical terms and visual identification of celestial bodies and Astronomy\u2019s new discoveries, the more information I started receiving...with more \u201Crealistic and closely related visuals.\u201D It was not long before all the detail work started to connect very well within my dreams. I would receive specific, wonderful gifts during Leonid or Quadrantid Meteor Showers, Equinoxes or Solstices. It was wonderful to discover that for several years, my healing dreams came to me during the same dates. I will never be a professional Astronomer nor Astrologer, but realize that for dreamers everywhere, these tools can be of great help and service. Using the Internet to navigate related, great sites can provide easytoreach research tools and there is free software that will allow you to keep track of the moon phases and astronomical visuals that can help, too.</p>\n\n<h3>DREAM AUGUST 2001</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I am visiting a building that specializes in Advertising and Public Relations. I am looking for someone in particular to discuss some details about something (I do not remember). I walk into a room and see thatit is in the process of being renovated, I walk into another and seethat this room is filled and busy with very delicate machinery. I walk towards the wall and notice a table with three transparent, flat, acrylic screens that are showing magnificent pictures, mainly in shades of red, orange, some grey and pockets of black. As I walk closer, I notice that the three screens are showing three sections of some remarkable picture from Space. I do not know what it is, but I know it is from outer Space. I ask the Office Manager what these are but she smiles and does not tell me. Regarding this dream, the moon was in Perigee to the Earth and it would be further clarified by the...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>ASTRONOMY CALENDAR FOR 2002</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Christmas Day 2001: <em>I am unwrapping a gift from my sister that is an Astronomy Calendar for 2002. Inside the cover page is something remarkable.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I awaken screaming and go get my dream journal. My painting of the beautiful three acrylic screens and the inside cover page present the same image! It\u2019s the center of the Galaxy as processed by the twin telescopes \u201CTwo Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\u201D in Arizona and Chile, in which they have captured the Milky Way galaxy and galaxies that lie beyond.</p>\n\n<p>This dream genuinely surprised me. I felt the light and understood, once again, that it might have something to do with what was happening out in Space. I did more research and learned that the Earth would be in Perihelion to the Sun on January the 4th, and the Moon would be in Perigee to the Earth on January 10th. I understood then the uneven sized knobs could be representing the Earth and Moon. It was a wonderful dream!</p>\n\n<p>I decided to use this dream as one of the three that are presented in this article, since it was taking place in a \u201Cbuilding dedicated to Advertising and Public Relations.\u201D My study group and I all had a good laugh at my reaction and it\u2019s nice to have confirmation, once again, that dreams relate to what\u2019s happening all around us... on many levels. \u2118</p>\n\n<h3>References:</h3>\n\n<p>Wonders of the Universe: Hansen Planetarium</p>\n\n<p>Websites: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041015134406/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.html\">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html\">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041011001823/http://www.winshop.com.au/annew/\">http://www.winshop.com.au/annew/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dibonsmith.com/\">http://www.dibonsmith.com/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041025082643/http://home.earthlink.net/~cosmichand/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~cosmichand/</a></p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3rcwi> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Website: <a href=\"http://dreamgate.com/\">dreamgate.com</a></p>\n\n<p>In the early 1980s, I was working as a counselor for the City &amp; County of San Francisco. These kids were from broken homes and they had generally experienced little but abuse and neglect throughout their lives. As that time I was interested in how fantasy and creativity (and lack of it) played a role in development, but I didn't know much about dreams.</p>\n\n<p>I began studying with Jungian analysts in San Francisco in the early 1980s, and found that dreams provided not only a wonderful arena for exploring fantasy and creativity but also provided a soulful feedback system and continual inner dialogue. After a few years I began studying with other people who worked with dreams in many other ways and shifted my focus away from pure Jungian dreamwork</p>\n\n<p>I was especially interested in the lack of education that therapists were receiving in graduate counseling programs and began a dream tutoring practice to allow counselors from various modalities to respond to their clients' dreams in a more sophisticated manner. I felt a little boxed in by the work. The one-to-one contact was meaningful, but I felt I was not reaching a large enough audience. Also, the notion of dreams only being in the service of healing seemed limited. I wanted something that involved the wider culture. Both of these needs came together when I first experienced the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>I began developing a wide variety of programs to network dreamworkers, distribute news, experiment with online dream sharing and provide information and education on dreams. This kind of global networking seemed the natural extension of the grassroots Dream Movement that had been developing since the 1960s, and I modeled much of the online community around this. The first part of the model I found in local dream sharing groups such as those made popular by Strephon William-Kapalan, Jeremy Taylor, Gayle Delaney, Stan Kirppner, Montague Ullman, and many others. Another grassroots trend was a networked outpouring of information, education and creative group projects that included such organizations as BADG (Bay Area Dreamworkers Group), the Dream Library and Archive, and the Dream Network Journal.</p>\n\n<p>My initial online community, the <a href=\"http://www.dreamgate.com/ed/\">Electric Dreams</a> Community, had, and still maintains at its core, a peer/partnership paradigm, and a focus towards online dream sharing. As new Internet projects came up, various members volunteered to coordinate and direct them. In this way the community remained a public service, being able to offer a monthly magazine (e-zine), continual online dream groups, the Global Dreaming News, and other projects.</p>\n\n<p>About the same time, I noticed that there was a great need for education about dreams and dreaming and started the DreamGate classes online which offered not only a background in the field of dreams, but hands-on groups through the Net.</p>\n\n<p>In 1996 I was part of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) Conference Committee and developed the Computer and Internet Resource and Exhibition Center for the Berkeley Conference, as well as contributing to the initial development of the IASD presence online and IASD web site, which I now manage for IASD. I have been very impressed by the way IASD attempts to provide a way for all fields to come together and study dreams encompassing all sides of the dream field, from anthropology, dream therapies, dreams and spiritual work, dream inspired art and literature, non-clinical dreamwork, dream telepathy, dream bio-physiology, and many other disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next decade, I was the IASD Webmaster, the Chair of the Electronic Communications Committee, and provided regular articles on dreaming and dreamwork online to the IASD magazine, Dream Time in the <a href=\"http://www.dreamgate.com/dream/cyberphile/\">Cyberphile column</a>. This has allowed me to develop the online projects for IASD with many, many people from around the world, and unfold the IASD mission to provide dream education for the public and to make the Association a truly international enterprise. For example, beginning in 2002, IASD began offering an international online conference with Ed Kellogg, Ph.D., call the PsiberDreaming Conference, for which I built the technical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005 I became the IASD Operations Director, managing the IASD office and its operations at the office in Berkeley. In 2018 the office went virtual and is now PO Box 206, Novato, CA 94948</p>\n\n<p>Another interest has been interested in the application of philosophy to dreamwork. How can the application of novel ideas compliment and further the developments in dreamwork?</p>\n\n<p>This work is collected on the <a href=\"http://www.dreamgate.com/pomo/\">Postmodern Dreaming page</a>.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

She has accumulated volumes since then filled with images, feelings, symbolism and characters that never fail to educate and inspire her and elucidate her waking world. Her philosophy is that working with people and their dreams is all about pulling in the pieces the unconscious hands us in our dreams, and integrating them into waking life to add dimension and arrive at that \u201Cah-ha\u201D meaning.</p>\n\n<p>As a professional art therapist and active member in the dream community for over 35 years, her approach to dreamwork is both intuitive and eclectic, and is sensitive to each person based on her toolbox of knowledge and experience of working with individuals and groups. She believes that a creative approach to dreamwork via expressive means can be done through journaling, art, dance, writing or Gestalting with dream imagery or any expressive method meaningful to the dreamer.</p>\n\n<p>Marlene served on the board and was a regular contributor to <a href=\"../@dreamnetwork\">Dream Network Journal</a> for nearly two decades. Her column, \u201CDream Times,\u201D appeared there and in the North Kitsap Herald. </p>\n\n<p>You can schedule personal dreamwork by phone or email via the contact form on her <a href=\"https://www.dreamtimesguide.com/contact/\">website</a>. She also has a blog, <a href=\"https://www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com/\">www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com</a>, that contains inspirational true stories and reflections from her life.</p>\n\n<p>Her inspirational novel, <strong><em>The Rainbow Watchers</em></strong>, released in the fall of 2018, is spiritual fiction based on a true NDE (near-death experience) that explores the possibilities life has to offer on both sides of the veil. <a href=\"https://www.therainbowwatchers.com/\">To learn more, visit www.therainbowwatchers.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Marlene holds a B.A. degree in Art History from the University of California, Santa Barbara and an M.A. in Art Therapy from Marylhurst University.

To have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the times to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world.</em> -Psyche Speaks, pgs. 88-89</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I recently attended a gathering of Northwest Coast Native tribes on one of the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, which, in essence, was a celebration of cultural revival and a sharing of Visions through storytelling, song and dance. I was able to see with vivid clarity - as regards dreams that come for community, that are intended to be shared on that level with others - how that's creativly integrated in Native American culture. It's also helped me to see the abject poverty of our culture in this respect. We simply don't provide enough places for the 'enacting' of the dream to occur at this time.</p>\n\n<p>I perceive, from the materials and information that come to the matrix of the Dream Network, that there is a growing desire among the general population to engage more seriously in their dreams; the satisfaction of that urge is trying to be satisfied in a variety of ways. It seems to me that what we have happening now in terms of <em>where</em> people can go with their dreams, is to private therapy with depth, transpersonal and Jungian therapists, like yourself... to dream groups or to the many individuals who cluster around the philosophy espoused by this publication... which, in essence, says that dreams are a common human experience and we do not need to rely, exclusively, on professional help to engage with our dreams and to integrate our dreams into our lives and culture. </p>\n\n<p>I'd like now to go directly to a quote from your book, Psyche Speaks, which stimulated the request for this interview: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"To have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the times to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world.\"</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given your statement and given that we are demonstrating a collective, cultural urge - or impulse - toward 'enacting and incarnating psyche in the world' - how do we go about creating that bridge into the home, the community, our schools... from your perspective? What are the safest ways to bring psyche's voice 'into the world'? How can we achieve this in ways that are creative, healing and not destructive.. given that we are talking about reopening considerable repression of emotions and... soul? </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> The issues that are involved are so large and in many ways so crucial, that it's difficult to know quite where to start. </p>\n\n<p>There's a great distrust of dreams; there has been forever, to one degree or another. Dreams, I think, are relatively subversive and so they are likely to be a threat in many different ways to whatever is the established order... whether that is the established order of the personality, or of a group, or of the larger collective of society. From my point of view, almost every dream has more to do with the future than with the past. Since most individuals, groups and societies function in a preservative mode, preserving a sense of self, of identity, a sense of collective identity... there's not a lot of tolerance for anything that has the capacity to question or overthrow whatever is the established process.</p>\n\n<p>In my mind, dreams have that function. Not just the occasional collective - or 'Big'- dream that some people have, but every dream has the potential of being a source of the future. And of course, most of the ways of working with dreams have to do with attempts to understand the dream in terms of the past. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of good work can be done that way; it's not that I'm questioning the value of that. What I do question is whether that work serves the dream. There is no question that dreams can be used in different ways and they can be used as vehicles to work and re-work the past. I think any work that tends to do that exclusively <em>fails the dream</em>, and so I am particularly interested in how to approach the dream in ways that will listen for what the intentionality of the dream is, in terms of the future. We can't do anything about the past, anyway; we can do very little about the present. The only thing we have hope of doing something about that is different than just being determined by the past is the future. So, the future, not being known, forces- I think - a certain way of listening to the dream that is not from the standpoint of knowledge, authority, understanding and so on... but, simply listening to what the dream has to say. </p>\n\n<p>Now that sounds very simple but, in fact, it is very difficult, because most of our attempts- whether on our own or working with someone else- tend to force the dream into some understanding that we already have. And, of course, it's much easier to pull the dream into some constructive understanding than it is to truly listen to the voice of the dream. True listening has the potential for reorganizing our whole psychology and sense of ourselves. Dreams have that potential, but it's anxiety provoking to open yourself that fully to a dream and so there are a lot of reasons for trying to bring understanding to the dream, which amounts, very often, to forcing the dream into already preconceived notions. </p>\n\n<p>That effort of listening to the dream- and particularly to its intentionality, to its \"future seeking\" value-I'm not sure that is the preserve of the professionals at all. Nor am I sure whether professionals are necessarily the best people to be listening in this way. Artists listen in this way. Poets listen in this way. Perhaps I should say some artists and poets. And so these activities- art and poetry- tend to be the places where you can see what's heard that's anticipating the future, more so than what you see in professional journals. If you look closely at what's happening in some art, what's happening in some poetry and some literature, what's happening in some of these creative processes... then you can start seeing the future in a way much more clearly than you can in what is presented as overt plans for the future. Our 'plans' for the future don't work nearly as well as some of the anticipations that one sees in art and poetry. </p>\n\n<p>One can see these anticipations of the future, as well, in the dreams and visions of people in different kinds of psychotic conditions, and in certain kinds of extreme human conditions, in certain extremity conditions altogether. And most of these things get seen as illnesses, or as problems, or only as reflecting problems... problems to be fixed, problems to be coped with or adapted to, etc. So, it's hardly surprising that where there are sources of power - whether that's political or financial power - the dream is hardly listened to in such places. </p>\n\n<p>I think, in the present world, the dynamics of money are probably the main determinant of most of what transpires. And for that reason, it seems significant to me that I can make a great deal of money interpreting or working with people's dreams in the ways that I do. And I know a whole lot of people who can make a whole lot of money doing that. </p>\n\n<p>But, I can't make any money from a dream. Nobody's going to pay me for a dream. If I tried to sell you a dream, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I tried to sell you a poem, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I try to sell you a dream that I think is important, that somebody just told me, you wouldn't buy it. And yet, these are the most valuable things we have. And nobody knows it. It's not that I want to be paid for my dreams; I don't. And I don't want to sell dreams. But in many ways, I believe that dreams are the most valuable things that we have and I would hope that the pervasiveness of money dynamics - as it seems to be developing in our culture - doesn't find a way to commodify dreams. </p>\n\n<p>There are dreams that I have heard which I think people need to hear. One of the things I want to do is to try and make some kind of place for such dreams, so that these dreams can be heard. I want to do that in some way which is not going to be influenced by the dollar; I don't know how to accomplish that but it's a project I have in mind. I don't want to interpret these dreams; I don't want to write a professional or Jungian commentary about those dreams. I could surely do that, but I don't want to. I want the dreams to be heard. I would like, somehow, for the dreams to be heard all over the place! </p>\n\n<p>So, some of the things that are going on, because of the computer network, the global highways, the ways we are able now to instantly communicate with vast numbers of people, I want to be able to use it. I don't want to sit back and just say that's horrible, because it's not. I do want to make use of computer technology as a way and means for the psyche to be heard. I think that psyche is going to be heard, in any event. The problem is whether we can hear it and get the message... or have the message forced on us. </p>\n\n<p>The psyche doesn't stand for not being heard for very long, whether that's in an individual's life, a group's life or a culture's life. The kind of community that can be generated from genuinely hearing what's going on in the psyche is an extraordinary community. This doesn't have to be in the same place, geographically, because we're not in the same place geographically anymore. That idea is I gone. Your real community in the future is going to be with you in Utah, me in Lake Stevens, X in Nova Scotia and Y in New Zealand and somehow we are going to be able to communicate and be an organic community, even though we're not in the same place. Finding ways of facilitating that sense of community is going to be a very interesting thing to do. </p>\n\n<p>I feel more in community with people I've never met, never seen, who are in Europe, or in Russia or South Africa, than I do with my neighbor across the road. And I can have two reactions about that: I can say that's horrible, we've got to have community right around us; but, what I've come to feel is that I don't want to insist on that anymore. First of all it's not happening organically. What is happening organically is a kind of psychic inner connection with people all over the world and I feel very connected with them. </p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I'm not in opposition to having community close at hand in my small town, but it doesn't seem to \u00B7 be happening. I don't know whether that's peculiar to me or...</p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I don't believe so. I'm hearing everywhere I go that there is no such thing as community anymore, except when a crisis occurs. I am experiencing it myself. It's a great loss, whatever the causes. I wasn't I aware of how much I miss a sense of community until attending the gathering I mentioned earlier. The setting was on an island in British Columbia. There, most people do not have, nor need, cars. Every day was a celebration of people in the streets, walking and genuinely greeting one another. That in itself was incredibly nourishing and made me painfully nostalgic because that's the way it used to be... </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I'm a strong believer in the <em>organicity</em> of community. The way in which community is genuinely formed is not to press the idea of community by saying we've got to have community and kind of force it in some way. That doesn't work. Community doesn't even mean that if you think about the word. The <em>munis</em> part of that word means \"gift\"; the <em>comm</em> part of it means \"together.\" So community that is organically based is based on <em>what we give</em> to each other. When you give something to another person and that gift starts circulating - that's the key thing: the circulation of gifts - then, you have community. </p>\n\n<p>Now, where does that happen? It certainly can happen with your next door neighbor, but it often doesn't. That's why now, what I can give, is to people that are not necessarily next door. The person next door doesn't I necessarily want what I have to give and if I give it to them it doesn't circulate, it stops. So, what's required is to give in a place where the gift will keep moving. </p>\n\n<p>Louis Hyde, in his book The Gift, a crucial book in this whole sense of things, pointed out one problem with the early Puritans is that when the Indians would give them the peace pipe, the Puritan would put it on his mantel. The gift became a <em>possession</em>. When the Indian came by the next time and saw the pipe still there, he took it. So, Indians became \"Indian givers\"; \"you can't trust an Indian.\"</p>\n\n<p>But, what the Indian was seeing was the death of community and that was very disturbing. The Indian understood that if everyone takes and possesses, we don't have community, we have power. That acquisitive power aspect, when we are in that mode, we can't give and therefore, we can't be a basis of community but only a basis of power. Communities that are based on power - that attend to the flux of power - are quite different than communities based on the flux of gifts. This is probably the most crucial thing in terms of how to find out where community is in the modern world. </p>\n\n<p>This is why I think with the kinds of technological communication - which is, of course, the same word that this is going to make possible a vast interaction of everybody in the world ... and communities are going to be quite different than what we've imagined them to be in the past. I had a dream some years ago, one of those voice dreams, you know, that has a compelling truth quality. It said, \"God is in the computer.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> That's an awesome statement to consider. A dream voice once said to an acquaintance: \"The unconscious is God.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> It's important to notice the dream does not say the computer is God, it says God is in the computer. Now there are certainly ways in which computers function as gods, lately. You go into the bank, and if the computer's not working, nothing is happening. They can't even do anything by hand anymore. So, the computer is sort of god there. I just read a book recently called <em>The Death of Money</em>, which gives a good picture of what happens when computers a reconceived of as god and instead of the dollar bill now being god, it's electronic money that has become god. </p>\n\n<p>Now, that's not quite the same as what my dream was saying. Because of that dream, I haven't been able to look away from what's happening in all the technological revolution, because if I trust the dream I have to trust the idea that God's in there. If God is in there, in the computer, then there's a certain sense in which the computer is a new church... or is the place where one might find God.</p>\n\n<p>This helps me in my relationship to technology and all the things that are coming in technology. In fact, the revolution in technology, which has been based largely on processes of miniaturization, has had the corresponding effect of increasing the power of individuals. The effects of this will escalate dramatically. It's happened within the last twenty years, for the most part. It has basically rendered the idea of countries, governments, large power blocks... as being relatively ineffective, in comparison with the power of individuals. Even economically, the power of individuals is increasing. It is now possible to create wealth more quickly with the idea an individual has than organizing large masses of machinery or materials or such things. A single idea, now, can produce more wealth almost instantly than a generation of 'stuff!' </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Stuff... from the Industrial era? </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> That \"stuff\" was characteristic of the industrial era and now we are changing into an information era. It's a knowledge revolution and knowledge is really the basis of power. You can't bomb knowledge. Once all the factories and means of production become robotized anyway, there's not going to be much point in bombing them. The whole idea of large bombs is going away and with it, of course, what it has supported. The huge global structures of war are becoming obsolete. We are in the process of seeing the obsolescence of large scale governments and, of course, in the process of that there is total chaos! That, coupled with the breakdown of what <em>has</em> contained so much, historically - institutions, traditions and so forth - leads to the present chaos. This situation, I think, often generates a kind of nostalgia and so we're trying to put things back together the way they were and... </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> They won't fit!</p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Exactly... and there's no going back. That going back is also related to trying to relate to the dream by dealing with it with what we already know. The past. I'm not so sure that embracing the future works by embracing the past. I don't think, for example, that the means of understanding the coming times are necessarily going to come by trying to interpret it in terms of what's already past. </p>\n\n<p>Using, for example, Greek mythology. Greek mythology was the stories of the Greeks as the psyche was then producing stories and art. Why would we want to take just those stories and say these are the stories of the psyche when the <em>psyche is producing stories all of the time.</em> New stories, different stories. Obviously, some with the same themes... but in new contexts. It's more a point, now, of trying to sensitize ourselves to what is coming and how to embrace the future, rather than being fearful about it. These things that are being developed are the tools of the future and like any tool, you can hit somebody over the head with it or you can do something creative with it. </p>\n\n<p>So, the problem we have is still the same problem. We have to have a kind of psychological development that is up to the development of the tools, or we're going to have a massive problem. And this, I think, is probably the source of much of the problem: the disparity between where the tools and the power are and where most people are. Many people in the world are still living 200 or maybe 2000 years ago. Living 10 years ago is dangerous to your health! D</p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I would like to get some clarifications for <em>Dream Network</em> readers on what you've said so far because you are introducing some new, timely and viable ways of looking at things. You are saying that we must listen to the dream as a way of embracing the future. Do you include all dreams?</p>\n\n<p>There are now people who are identifying different <em>types</em> of dreams... such as precognitive dreams being those which show us a future event or condition ... but I hear you saying that you are listening as though all dreams are giving us guidance into future time. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. What I would like to propose is that all dreams, regardless of their seemingly different types, are ways into the future, are preparing for the future. This is something I'm in the process of working on in a book I'm currently writing. It may seem a bit odd as a way of looki ng at the dream but conceiving the dream this way brings up the question of how one is to relate to the dream and, again, putting things in an extreme form as a way of making a point, all dreams are to be enacted. Now that seems a bit dangerous and radical... </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> And challenging! </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. Some might say stupid. If you have a dream that you go over and kill your neighbor, does that mean you go over and kill yo ur neighbor? Is that what I mean by enacting? Obviously, that's not what I mean. Talking about every dream as having something to do with the future, does not mean that one becomes a slave and simply act out the dream. There's a world of difference between acting out and enacting and this is the crucial point. Enacting the dream requires <em>consciousness</em>. A conscious relationship to the dream, a kind of eros with the dream. This is totally absent when one is simply acting out the dream. And that's the chief difference between what one might see as a dangerous suggestion... that one just go act out what the image of the dream has shown. That's not enacting the dream at all. At the same time, when the dream pictures you killing your neighbor, what do you suppose it could possibly be to enact such a dream? What would that look like? What would you do? </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> First of all, make a determination about what the dream means. Who is the neighbor? What does the neighbor symbolize? If one were to look at the neighbor subjectively, he or she would no doubt be showing some aspect of oneself that needs to be disposed of. If looked at objectively - if there is, in fact, a serious problem with the neighbor, some righteous conflict resolution appears to be in order. </p>\n\n<p>I understand what you are asking. I encounter this all the time... peole who are so inclined toward the quick explanation, toward the literal interpretation of dreams. That's one danger we face, it seems, as more people become interested, considering that by far the majority of people will not or cannot access someone who is in a professional capacity. The concern becomes how to educate, how to get the information out, in order that people are led to the quality resources, to the right information. This, so that we may begin doing what really is <em>simple and intuitive</em>, but since we have been deprived of - and are just in the process of reclaiming - this precious side of our nature, it becomes a considerable and sometimes lengthy process. Providing quality information, education and resources are joyful and immense responsibilities for all of us who are involved. </p>\n\n<p>Before I ask the next question, I'd like to reflect a bit on what you've been sharing. First, I totally agree that we are in a position, maybe for the first time... maybe... in the history of the human species on this planet, where we really don't have any precedents in history - even yesterday - which can help us move into tomorrow, into the future. What you are introducing is a new concept, that we must begin recognizing that the time for reaching into the past - into the places where the woundings have occurred - need, now, to become those transformative experiences which become our personal mythology. Those which can carry us into the creation of a new way. It seems that this is our challenge... in the midst of the present-day chaos. </p>\n\n<p>You have indicated, in response to the question of psyche's voice being heard in the world, that the kind of messages we're receiving from psyche, those that are ready to be heard out in the world, are the dreams that don't want or need to be interpreted. Are you saying that if is the dreams, which Jung referred to as coming from the level of the collective unconscious, that are ready to be heard ? </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Let me say a couple of things about this. I would like to say that every dream needs to be heard. What I mean first of all is that the dreamer needs to hear the dream. The dreamer needs to listen to what the dream is saying. That's the first place of hearing is the dream. A lot of people don't hear their dreams, so, there's a whole part of a person's life that they're not hearing. There is a collective task to get people hearing their dreams. I encourage everyone to listen to their dreams... so, that's the first place of hearing and it's very deficient at the moment. </p>\n\n<p>As many people as are interested in dreams, or who are in therapy at this time, there is really very little of it going on in the world. That's the first place of hearing that needs to be animated. I mean, we compulsively go to the TV or the movies or whatever and we already have a theater going on inside us all the time. And it's free! It's one of the few things that the economy hasn't quite insinuated itself into, as yet. Although, in many ways it is, because we are so distracted by the economics of TV and movies and everybody's desperately involved in those things, when there's a whole source of such things going on inside that doesn't cost a dime! </p>\n\n<p>So, there's that first place of hearing. Every dream needs to be heard. That creates the channel, as it were, for the objective psyche, or the divine or whatever one wants to call it, to come in. I don't care what one calls it, there is something there to be heard from. No matter how prosaic any dream seems, it's the beginning of a hearing of <em>something else</em> and it's that something else that needs to be heard. </p>\n\n<p>I wouId go so far as to say every dream needs to be told. And how do you tell it? Well, first of all, you have to <em>tell it to yourself</em>. Just hearing it is one thing but telling it to yourself is another. And by telling, here, I mean an act of consciousness with the dream that has certain features. One must <em>really become curious</em> about the images of the dream. That one goes into the dream again, perhaps imagining or allowing the dream to work on us in our waking life, not just in our sleeping life but in our waking life and allowing it to work on us in such a way - what Jung called \"Dreaming the dream onward,\" or technically, active imagination, which itself is a very difficult thing to achieve. Basically, the idea is that it's a way of <em>participating in the dream consciously</em>. It is an act of consciousness of taking oneself into the dream world again and being there, but being there with consciousness now. That's another step one takes with the dream. There are many steps. </p>\n\n<p>One can make something from the dream, manifest the dream somehow in the world. Even the dream where one kills one's neighbor. If the dreamer were to paint this image of killing the neighbor, I can guarantee you that things would start stirring that s/he didn't know were there... that s/he needs to know are there, for their future. To enact the dream in a painting and let the paining speak to us and let all the actions that are involved in painting speak to us... brings up all sorts of things that are the stuff of our future. </p>\n\n<p>So, there are many ways of enacting the dream and many ways of telling the dream. Telling our dreams to our partners ... and I don't mean 'dumping' the dream... I don't mean saying the dream to someone else as if they're then supposed to do something with it. We can't really tell the dream until we've heard the dream as fully as possible. </p>\n\n<p>If we dream and wake up and tell our partner... nothing has happened. We haven't heard the dream deeply enough in order to tell it deeply enough. We've just put it on a conveyer belt and sent it along. That's not what I mean by telling a dream. Hearing is a very deep inner process and telling from that place of hearing so deeply about any dream, it has an inductive effect on the other person. It's related to the kind of art, for example, when we see it, it produces the urge to paint or to write-not the urge to possess - but the urge to create. When art has that effect, then art is serving its purpose for the future. It's bringing the fruit of the future by doing that. Our dreams are the same way. Putting a dream on a conveyer belt and sending it out, that's not what I mean. If we hear it deeply enough and tell from that deep place, then we induce an erotic connection to the other. That kind of telling is very erotic and it is what makes for very deep relationship. </p>\n\n<p>A community that comes from that kind of sharing, giving the gift of a dream to another... after one has heard it as deeply as possible... to me, that is the idea I sequence of things in bringing the dream to the world. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> In that way it relates to the community of giving that you were referring to earlier. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. And so, I think that the age of Aquarius being upon us, it's useful to use the imagery of Aquarius as being characteristic of what this might mean. Aquarius is a waterbearer. It is not quite clear whether Aquarius is male or female and so gender is not so much an issue. The issue is the bringing of the water. What I imagine this to be - and where the dream is the vehicle - is that, opening ourselves as deeply as possible to the other is the way we can fill the jug. Then, we take that jug to the common pool and we pour that jug into that calm pool made of these pourings of each of us. That is the water of community. Our gift to the common pool. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Sounds like soul food to me! </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Soul food it is. Dreams are free and they have to be freely given. The community that generates out of that, the gift giving of that, is going to be something we've never seen before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> It reminds me of what Kilton Stewart brought to us about the Senoi people. I recognize that what Stewart shared has been questioned. .. but the paradigm is viable. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I don't care whether Kilton Stewart's work is a fantasy! The ideas are psychologically correct. They are good images for what is necessary in the times to come. That we go to that place of psyche and bring from there the gift to the community. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> So be it. Thank you, Russell.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zflies> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zflies-0.jpg\" alt=\"Butterflies\" /></p>\n\n<p><!--nopreview--><div class=\"caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>\u201CButterfly Party\u201D Photography by Laura Atkinson</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>\n\n<p>As I unlocked the polished white door of my hotel room, I recited the inscribed jet-black lettering that read: \"June 12th, Procession of the Unmarried Woman. In which single women walk through the centre of their village looking for a husband. (Palestrina, Italy.)\" I felt obligated to check the calendar. Yes, indeed it was June 12th. On an afternoon that supplied an abundance of heavy, dark clouds pregnant with moisture, I had set out on a solo journey to navigate a foreign railway system determined to find my own way to the city. I asked the universe \u201C..please show me some signs to follow\u2026\u201D In retrospect, that fine lettering seemingly indicated the type of day it had been. </p>\n\n<p>Months before, I began selling my belongings; furniture, knick knacks, dishes, paintings and more. I left behind the city apartment which I had called home for 14 years and started my journey to be with my partner of 5 years in his beautiful European country. Too soon after arriving, I found myself on a plane returning to the States. These events would prove to be the pivotal moments for my individualized catalyst of change. </p>\n\n<p>Being an artist, photographer and devoted dream journalist, I had always considered myself to be moderately skillful at recognizing dreamscape symbolism. Admittedly I am not an expert interpreter, but I consider myself capable of identifying their appearances and working with them. As I wandered my way back to the States, uncertain of any predetermined destination, it felt natural to ask my dreams for guidance. My dreams had been my constant friends in the past, but now I was depending on them.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zflies-1.jpg\" alt=\"Butterfly emerging\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Thin Veil of a Butterfly</h3>\n\n<p>I dream of being wrapped in thin silk from head to toe. It is wrapped around my legs and arms, quite difficult to move. I wiggle my arms above my head and push my hands outward against the silk. Through its transparency I am able glimpse a view to a new world\u2026</p>\n\n<p><em>7/12/10</em></p>\n\n<h3>A Visit to the Butterfly Garden</h3>\n\n<p>It was my second visit to the garden nursery in Rhode Island. The warm, milky sunshine and abundance of flora provided a sweetly scented backdrop to what would be the beginning of an ongoing and wondrous experience in synchronicity. With my camera strapped around my neck, I walked upon a pebbled walk-way through a beautiful butterfly garden. Like fidgety toddlers, the butterflies were not behaving and refused to sit for the portraits I longed to take. Rarely would they land on a flower and if they did it was never long enough to catch their image. I shook my head with impatience and was ready to put my camera away. </p>\n\n<p>From the corner of my eye I caught sight of a grey-blue painted, metal chair sitting alone at the corner of the garden. Delicately dangling from the curved edge of the chair was the chrysalis of a Monarch butterfly. It captivated me, those fine details of tightly folded orange and black wings that could be seen through the translucent casing. As I gazed upon it, my dream from earlier that month immediately entered my consciousness. I became the solitary cheerleader for the emergence of this little creature. I stayed with the Monarch for over 45 minutes as it struggled from its outer shell. In my mind I heard unspoken words <em>\u201CYou cannot rush a butterfly,\u201D</em> nor can you help it break free of its cocoon, otherwise the risk exists of damaging delicate wings. I simply watched and waited patiently while I slowly snapped photographs of the small miracle unfolding before my eyes.</p>\n\n<h3>A Visit to the Consignment Store</h3>\n\n<p>After arriving in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I was introduced to a lovely little consignment store. Nestled among four butterfly dessert plates was Jung\u2019s book <strong>Synchronicity</strong>. Having never read it before, I purchased it, thinking: \u201CWell isn\u2019t that a nice coincidence!\u201D Little did I know that this synchronicity of change and butterflies was still in play. </p>\n\n<p><em>8/24/2010</em></p>\n\n<h3>The Mountain Top</h3>\n\n<p>I drove with my car windows down to an overlook pass on the top of Buffalo Mountain, my camera and Jung\u2019s <em>Synchronicity</em> on the passenger\u2019s seat. I parked my car and grabbed my newly purchased book. It was at that moment a lemonade-yellow butterfly fluttered in through the passenger side window, landed on my arm for a few moments, and then flew out the driver\u2019s side window. My internal dialog asked: <em>Is this a dream? Am I awake?</em> And my inner voice answered my question with another question: <strong><em>Does it make a difference?</em></strong> I decided to simply be moved with the moment, enjoy the metaphor, the beauty, the symbolism, and just become present with the experience. I followed the flight pattern of this single yellow butterfly as it landed on a group of soft-purple milk thistles. Then I watched in awe as at least a dozen more multi-colored butterflies of various species began landing on the flowers surrounding it; each one, carried by the soft wind, landing right before my eyes. Among the many there was a Monarch with its recognizable markings, a deep black butterfly with metallic blue luminescence spotted with pumpkin orange and white droplets, a butterfly speckled with colors of curry and saffron, and my special lemonadeyellow butterfly sitting tall on the highest thistle. Softly and gently they went about their daily business of sipping nectar and picking up pollen, each pausing briefly on the tips of the thistle. I stood alone for an hour on top of the blue-green mountain with only the butterfly-party as my company as I captured their images.</p>\n\n<p><em>8/25/2010</em></p>\n\n<p>So how do I define the butterfly experience? Great question. I had been navigating without a map for several weeks, asking the universe to provide guidance, some signs about the path I am on; provide some sort of divine inspiration I could draw upon. And in response, my dreams answered as did the collection of \u201Ccoincidences\u201D happening with my eyes wide open. </p>\n\n<p>The continuing butterfly events were dreamlike and awe-inspiring. With my camera I have been intentionally, physically and symbolically \u201Cshifting my focus.\u201D My 20/10 eyesight provides minor details at great distance on the horizon, but in doing that so frequently, I often fail to see what\u2019s right in front of my eyes. What I had been doing is purposefully noticing and appreciating the finer details. </p>\n\n<p>This series of experiences not only raised the bar but it shifted it as well. It triggered a new awareness from within, and united it with a new appreciation for symbols and synchronicities. Just as I am capable of interpreting the metaphors and symbols that dreams provide, the time has come to start acknowledging and working with the signs and symbols while awake. Quite possibly, this is what it is all about. Shifting focus to see the microcosm, the macrocosm, the foreground, the background, connecting it all and being open to \u201Cseeing\u201D it all, including the coincidences that thread it all together. </p>\n\n<p>I will openly embrace synchronicities that may unfold in both future waking and sleeping dreamscapes, for I know that my personal transformation is not over. You cannot rush a butterfly. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfacet> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>For many centuries, Western investigators had little respect or regard for native healing systems. In recent years, however, such prominent psychotherapists as Jeanne Achterberg (1985), E.F. Torrey (1986), and J.D. Frank (Frank &amp; Frank, 1991) have found many native healing systems to be extremely sophisticated and to contain elements that can be instructive for Western practitioners, e.g., the use of imagination and altered states of consciousness for health and personal growth.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-0.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Krippner\" width=\"300px\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<p>I have compared the healing models of several native healing traditions with those of allopathic medicine, finding both similarities and differences (Krippner &amp; Welch, 1992). Intending to do the same for dreamworking systems, I located a model proposed by Ullman and Zimmerman (1979) that compared three Western systems, those of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Montague Ullman. I added two facets to the model, and revised several others to provide a better basis for cross- cultural comparison. The resulting 10-facet model still was useful in comparing the systems of Freud, Jung, and Ullman:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-1.jpg\" alt=\"Montague Ullman\" width=\"300px\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<h3>1. What is the function of dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Freud: To discharge repressed instinctual responses.</p>\n\n<p>B. Jung: To disclose unacknowledged aspects of the self.</p>\n\n<p>C. Ullman: To serve as an adaptive form of consciousness during sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>2. What motivates people to recall their dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Freud: People often try not to recall dreams because they contain repressed material, but in psychoanalysis, the dream is the \"royal road to the unconscious\" and helps people to understand their personal psychodynamics, e.g., the role of wish fulfillment in dreams.</p>\n\n<p>B. Jung: By recalling dreams, people can work toward individuation, e.g., by understanding how, in dreams, they compensate for the undeveloped parts of their psyche.</p>\n\n<p>C. Ullman: Through dream recall, dreamers can become aware of their waking life predicament and their feelings about it.</p>\n\n<h3>3. What is the source of dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains repressed desires.</p>\n\n<p>B. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains the undeveloped aspects of the psyche.</p>\n\n<p>C. Dreams come from the unconscious, which consists of material that dreamers ignore or repress.</p>\n\n<h3>4. What is the language of dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>\n\n<p>B. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>\n\n<p>C. Imagery is a vehicle for expressing dream content and feeling as visual metaphors.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Are dream symbols universal?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Sexual symbols occur, in various forms, in all cultures.</p>\n\n<p>B. Archetypal symbols are universal, personal symbols are not.</p>\n\n<p>C. There are no universal symbols; dream imagery is rooted in one's daily experience and in one's culture.</p>\n\n<h3>6. What is the role of one's current life situation in dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Day residue touches off memories of an earlier conflict.</p>\n\n<p>B. Day residue opens up undeveloped parts of the psyche.</p>\n\n<p>C. Day residue opens up issues not attended to while awake.</p>\n\n<h3>7. What techniques are used to work with dreams?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Free association is used in dream working.</p>\n\n<p>B. Free association and amplification are used in dreamworking.</p>\n\n<p>C. Dreamworking assesses dream metaphors through the exploration of the associative context.</p>\n\n<h3>8. What is the role of the dream worker?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Psychoanalysts tell dreamers their dreams' meanings.</p>\n\n<p>B. Psychotherapists function as guides.</p>\n\n<p>C. Psychotherapists and other dreamworkers function as guides but the dreamer is the final felt authority regarding the dream's meaning.</p>\n\n<h3>9. What role do dreams play in the culture?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Dreams reflect a culture's repressed material.</p>\n\n<p>B. Dreams reflect a culture's mythic archetypes.</p>\n\n<p>C. Dreams are socially grounded in the culture and reflect unsolved social as well as personal issues.</p>\n\n<h3>1O. How are anomalous dreams viewed?</h3>\n\n<p>A. Anomalous dreams are subject to the same psychodynamics as other dreams.</p>\n\n<p>B. Anomalous dreams reflect archetypal material and synchronicities.</p>\n\n<p>C. Anomalous dreams are valuable resources, e.g., in understanding emotional interactions.</p>\n\n<p>When doing archival or field research with indigenous groups, this modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used to advantage. However, it is important to try to differentiate \"function\" and \"motive.\" The \"function\" of the dream might be conceptualized as adaptive (e.g., to assist the myelinization of nerve cells, to develop the eyes' binocularity) or informational (e.g., to assist in problem-solving, to bring new information to the dreamer). The \"motive\" to recall one's dreams might be to find game during the hunt, to make contact with deceased relatives, or to receive direction as to one's vocation.</p>\n\n<p>\"Function\" refers to the operation of the total human organism within a given historical and geographical contex t, while \"motive\" refers to more specific personal and community goals. Ofien there will be more than one function and more than one motive. In addition, there might be a {natural} function of dreaming (e.g., vigilance during the night) and an overlaid function (e.g., humans have learned to use dreams as natural healing mechanisms).</p>\n\n<p>In identifying the source of dreams, the Western concept of the unconscious may be comparable in some ways to the \"spirit realm,\" the \"other world,\" or other purported realities of which the dreamer is usually unawa re during wakefulness. The language of the dream can be described in terms of dream images as aspects of human imagination or as actual characters cmd events that exist in a parallel or non-ordinary reality. The dreamer's life situation often needs to be studied in terms of community concerns, e.g., hunting, harvesting, fighting, worshiping.</p>\n\n<p>Techniques of working with dreams may include both individual and group dreamwork, if both are present in a given system. The dreamworkers in native cultures might be shamans, mediums, priests, priestesses, etc. Native dreamworking techniques would include those carried out by the tribal practitioner, the family, or the community as a whole. Dreamworking often plays a more important role in native societies than in Western culture, as do anomalous dreams. It is no surprise that these two facets were omitted by Ullman and Zimmerman; I added them because of their ubiquitous presence in native dreamworking systems.</p>\n\n<p>As an example of how the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used cross-culturally, I read accounts of the way dreams were used by the Maricopa tribe. Located in southeastern California, and a member of the Hokan-Yuman linguistic group, the Maricopa Indians lived in domed bark, thatched, or hide houses. When the Europeans arrived in North America, the Maricopa cultivated maize but also gained sustenance from a variety of wild plants and game (Yenne, 1986). At the heart of the Maricopa culture was the dream experience. Spier (1970) remarks that \"it was the one thing of which they constantly talked, the [most] significant aspect of their life ... .Dream experience was at the bottom of all success in life, and as such [was] their constant preoccupation. Learning was replaced by dreaming\" (p. 236). The way that dreams were used by the Maricopa responds to each of the questions proposed by the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model:</p>\n\n<h3>1. {What is the function of dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>Dreams were believed to be nighttime adventures that expressed \"spirit, \" i.e., supernatural power.</p>\n\n<h3>2. {What motivates people to recall their dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>It was held that dreams bestowed special abilities (e.g., to heal, to hunt); dreams often produced sacred songs and, rarely, entire song cycles. Dreams enabled guardian spirits to interact with the dreamer. Dreams predicted the future so that the dreamer could attempt to avoid or exploit the forthcoming event. Dreams indicated the degree of success the dreamer might expect in his or her life.</p>\n\n<h3>3. {What is the source of dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>It was believed that one's soul was \"taken out\" by power animals or spirits during dreaming to a \"dream world,\" the source of dreams. Songs, cures, future events, etc., were revealed to the soul during dreaming.</p>\n\n<h3>4. {What is the language of dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>It was thought that dream images were entities from the \"dream world\" that depicted dreamers' potential abilities, forthcoming circumstances, etc. For example, dream images of Eagle indicated that the dreamer could become a great singer, of Buzzard or Coyote to become a healer, of Mockingbird to become an orator, of Frog to become a sorcerer, of Crow to become a thief. lt was believed that men who dreamed of a certain mountain would become \"Berdaches\" (i.e., transvestites) and that dreams of birds fighting each other meant that the dreamer would become sick.</p>\n\n<h3>5. {Are dream symbols universal?}</h3>\n\n<p>Meanings of dream images were the same for all tribal members, but there could be multiple meanings for some images, e.g., Buzzard could reveal an enemy's location as well as disclose cures.</p>\n\n<h3>6. {What is the role of one's life situation in dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>Dreams could be rehearsals for life events, e.g., pregnancy. One's success depended on dreaming, but it was believed that children who dreamed too much might experience a sex change. The Maricopa took the position that most of their dreams dealt more with the contemporary scene than with tribal myths.</p>\n\n<h3>7. {What techniques are used to work with dreams?}</h3>\n\n<p>Dreams were frequently discussed among friends. When dreamers told their dreams, they would begin by mentioning the song from their dream, if one was present. Later, song cycles would review important individual dreams for the benefit of the entire community.</p>\n\n<h3>8. {What is the role of the dreamworker?}</h3>\n\n<p>The shaman and the song leader were the tribal authorities on dreams, and would discuss dreams with tribal members. The shaman was considered the expert regarding the cultural meanings of dreams, but both practitioners would frequently dream songs themselves, and would decide what songs of other dreamers would be incorporated into song cycles. However, a dreamer would not reveal a dream to anyone else if the dream involved a spirit visitation over a long period of time; the dreamer would be trained as a warrior, an orator, or a member of some other vocation during sleep. It was only after the spirits pronounced their preparation complete that the dreamer could use the powers they granted.</p>\n\n<h3>9. {What role do dreams play in the culture?}</h3>\n\n<p>It was held that spirits only manifest themselves in dreams, and that they grant specific powers to dreamers who are conscientious and prepared. More than any other activity, dreams established and reinforced the unity of the Maricopa culture.</p>\n\n<h3>10. {How are anomalous dreams viewed?}</h3>\n\n<p>It was believed that supernatural power only comes in dreams. The Maricopa used the same word {cara'g} for \"spirit\" and \"dream.\"</p>\n\n<p>The educational and training function by dreams among the Maricopa demonstrate how malleable the dreaming process is, and how a culture can shape its members' dreams. The social roots of the dream have been discussed by Ullman (1960) who observed how cultural myths serve to make experience intelligible, and that the unsolved problems of individuals in that culture are worked with within that mythic framework. Myths often come to life in a dream as sources of support or as sources of cmxiety, depending on the underlying nature of the immediate conflict (p. 184).</p>\n\n<p>This brief discussion illustrates the value of studying dream systems from other cultures. It can demonstrate the limits of social frameworks in which the individual dream operates, as well as the limits of idiosyncratic elements that dreamers bring to their dream experience. It is easier to detect mythic elements in the dreams of people from native societies than from dreamers from societies without a monolithic mythic structure. In these cases, however, the impact of family and institutional myths may be detected. There is an urgent need for more information in these areas, and cross-cultural research can play an important role in this quest.</p>\n\n<h3>References:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Achterberg, J. (1985).

I have included two dreams in which I used that \"light.\" </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-1.jpg\" alt=\"Assignment dreams\" width=\"300px\" height=\"auto\"></p>\n\n<h2>ENVIRONMENT of the DREAMS &amp; the DREAMER:</h2>\n\n<p>My students tell me I require more work than most professors, but the most often repeated comment on student evaluations, is that I care about my students; I act as sort of \"mom\" role for them. Yet another role I assume is \"coach\". I use \"coaching\" language and techniques. Not surprisingly, one of the dreams included in this article reflects the coach role as well as the role of a mom. Quieting to me, though, is the clear message in both dreams, to me, to ease off - to stand back.</p>\n\n<h2>SETTING OF THE FIRST DREAM:</h2>\n\n<p>I assigned an ethics case for my principles of accounting classes. The case involved a graduating senior who had job interviews at two separate companies in the same city. Upon discovering he would be reimbursed for interviewing expenses, the student billed both companies for the <em>full</em> amount of his expenses. </p>\n\n<p>In our brief class discussion, a couple students openly said they would have done the same thing; that is, take double reimbursement. However, later when I read the students' written responses to the ethics question, I was surprised to find the same comment made by <em>several</em> other students. I gave considerable thought of what to say to the classes for our next meeting. I finally had my talk prepared on how it is very important to be honest in coming to know oneself and so I appreciated the honesty in the responses. I planned then to lead into a discussion of the matter of treating others as one would like to be treated. I thought my plan was set. Then the following dream came in the early morning the day I planned to give my \"little talk\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Don't Ask Your Students to Wash Their Dirty Laundry in Public</em></strong></p>\n  \n  <p><em>People are washing clothes in a laundry area of our apartment building. They brought the clothes up from the basement. I bring my clothes to wash also. A woman who was washing in the basement is now washing upstairs in this laundromat sort of area. A young man, probably a college student, is standing close to her and when he sees me, he says very loudly and possessively to me, \"I'm next\". I take my basket of clothes downstairs and talk very loud in mimic of the young man's \"I'm next\" as I go down the stairs. But when I get to the basement, I understand why these people aren't washing in the basement - either there aren't machines here now, or they aren't working. The upstairs is more like a laundromat, than the basement.</em></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[Oh, the 'washing your dirty clothes in public' dream is saying not to say anything about the students' ethics case answers in class. Several students said they would take the \"double\" reimbursement for interviewing trip.]</strong> (The bold type indicates the \"aha\" point which came just as I finished typing the dream.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The dream is saying my planned talk on the ethics case in class is like asking my students to \"wash their dirty laundry in public.\" (Laundromat - a public place.) The matter is a personal matter and best handled at the subconscious level (the basement). Discussing the matter further in class is like asking my students to reveal in public what each can only decide for themselves. (Clothes are often symbolic of the personality.) </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-0.jpg\" alt=\"clothing in public\" width=\"400px\" height=\"auto\"></p>\n\n<p>Assigning the ethics case provided an opportunity for each student to cleanse personality attitudes and emotions in the privacy of their subconscious level. However, my \"appraisal\" of the students responses would cause the students to bring their \"cleansing work\" to the mental level in defense of their attitudes and render the \"washing machines in the basement\" (use of subconscious mind) inoperable for improving understanding and cleansing attitudes. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the dream seems to confirm what I had already said in class the day the case was assigned: We must live in consideration for others. Likely, the setting of the dream, in an apartment complex (several people involved), confirms the need for consideration of others. Likewise, the young man student who loudly and possess-ively tells me \"I'm next\" confirms his lack of consideration for others while watching out intensely for his own interests. </p>\n\n<p>Notice, too, my own mimic of the student's \"I'm next,\" which seems to point out by <strong>exaggeration</strong> that for me to <strong>repeat</strong> the students' comments about accepting the double reimbursement is certainly an unprofessional and unproductive method of dealing with the situation. Apparently my \"dream counselor\" is saying my \"wellplanned\" little talk would be a taunting insult to my students. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the dream is further saying my planned talk wasn't from the my inner resources. (When I arrive in the basement - subconscious level - the washing machines are either not there or are inoperable.) Even though I gave the matter considerable thought I still didn't feel completely satisfied with what I planned to say. And, finally, notice I was also planning to wash my dirty clothes. </p>\n\n<p>How I used my dream: When I went to class the day of the dream, I gave each student their copy of the textbook authors' comments on the ethics case and made a note to myself to assign the ethics cases from most of the chapters we will cover. But I did NOT give my planned \"little talk.\"</p>\n\n<h2>SETTING of the SECOND DREAM:</h2>\n\n<p>I use a <em>team</em> approach in teaching an advanced auditing class where the class size ranges between twelve to fifteen students. We sit around oblong tables pulled together and act as an auditing team with me, the professor, as the partner-in-charge. This spring I purposely used only one table in order to bring the students in close eye-to-eye contact. </p>\n\n<p>One of the hardest working students in the class was also the star of the university men's basketball team. The dream came in early morning the day there was major auditing case work due as well as an important basketball game that night. </p>\n\n<p>About \"gymnastics:\" My husband often uses the word \"gymnastics\" in referring to frustration from excessive paperwork. </p>\n\n<h2>THE GYMNASTICS AUDIT TEAM &amp; the COACH-MOM</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I am an observer. There is a coach and young athletes - perhaps nine or ten. The coach is at the head of two parallel bars on which the young athletes are doing training. It seems like they are turning over the bars. The bars are two rows close together and the athletes are boys and girls. They are probably the same age, but the girls look more mature. At first I only notice the boys and one in particular. He is tired and thinks the coach is expecting too much. The boy says he has some injury and crawls between the bars toward the lady coach. She doesn't stop the practice, but keeps on going. The boy now does half-hearted turning over the bars. Now it is the end of the day's session and <strong>the boy quits the team!</strong> And now others quit the team and there are only six girls left; they don't complain. They seem to be willing to work. The coach is discouraged though. I believe she is wondering if there will be enough participants on the team for the next competition (but the dream is unclear on that point).</em></p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Now I seem like the coach</strong> and am standing just inside the door at the house of the boy who quit first. It is dusk-like in this modest room. The boy's mother is in the room. She is very discouraged about the boy quitting. She is very disappointed. She had high hopes of how well things were going. She knew he had something to overcome -fight back from something- but had thought her son was making progress.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The parallel bars, so close together, is the setting for the auditing class. The arrangement of the young women and young men was basically the same as in the classroom with the young wo men on one side and the young men on the other side with the coach at the front end. </p>\n\n<p>For the young athlete-scholar, the intense practice <strong>was</strong> his style except when the <em>\"gymnastics\" (unnecessary \"paper work\")</em> required of him as a student, coupled with the demands placed on him as an superior athlete, took more strength than he physically possessed. In the dream his \"injury\" portrays this. His crawling toward the coach shows his desperate need for relief. </p>\n\n<p>The young man's mother (the mom in the professor) is concerned about him in a more compassionate and understanding way than the coach who has a greater interest in the team's being able to do well against competition than in the physical, emotional or mental well being of the gymnast-students. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How I used the dream:</em></strong> I immediately cut back on the work assignments for the auditing class.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfgil1> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-0.jpg\" alt=\"Hoffman at his computer\" /></p>\n\n<p>Dreams have long been a source of inspiration for musical composers of all genres. For example, Richard Wagner \u2013 who once wrote that \u201Call poetry is only true dream interpretation\u201D \u2013 recounted in his autobiography that he was unable to find a way to begin his gigantic Ring of the Niebelungen cycle when he had a dream in which he felt that he was drowning in overwhelming waves, while the figurations of an E flat major chord sounded in his mind. When he awoke, he realized that his dream had provided him with the opening of Das Rheingold, which is set at the bottom of the Rhine River. </p>\n\n<p>When I proposed doing a symposium on music and dreaming to some colleagues at the 2010 IASD conference, what I had in mind to present was exploring how music finds its way into my dreams and how my unconscious mind is able to recognize musical themes and compositions. However, recent events in my dream life have transformed this study into an exploration of how music found its way out of my dreams and into a partially finished composition. </p>\n\n<p>I have journaled my dreams for the past 19 years, using a database program that allows me to retrieve motifs with ease over the entire period. Out of a total of 9,696 recorded dreams, 332 contain the words \u201Cmusic\u201D or \u201Cmusical\u201D \u2013 an average of 3.4% of the total. Over time, the number of musical dreams averaged 17.3 per year, and tended to increase to a peak in year 11 (2002-3), then to decrease to around the mean, and lastly to increase again sharply, starting in year 18 and continuing to the present (2009-11). (See Figure 1).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Graph\" /></p>\n\n<p>In addition to these two keywords, there have been numerous other occurrences of musical genres in my dreams. Music has always been a part of my life; I trained as a clarinetist from an early age and played in bands and orchestras through my second year in college. Over the past 9 years, as the result of a dream I reported in DNJV24#1, I have returned to instrumental practice on the crumhorn, a Renaissance double reed instrument ancestral to the oboe and the English horn. Mostly my interest is in classical music, but as Table 2 shows, both jazz and rock music appear in my dreams and are part of my waking appreciation, also. Missing from this list\u2014and of less interest to me in waking life\u2014are popular music, folk music, country, hip-hop, rap, and such genres. They do show up in my dreams, but more rarely. So, this listing somewhat parallels my musical tastes. However, as I do not consider myself to be a particularly good singer, it is a bit surprising that song shows up at the top of the list.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 2: Genres (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Song \u2013 100 <br>Performance \u2013 96 <br>Tune \u2013 86 <br>Symphony \u2013 46 <br>Opera \u2013 25 <br>Voice \u2013 23 <br>Jazz \u2013 20 <br>Concerto \u2013 17 <br>Rock \u2013 16 <br>Classical \u2013 10 <br>Prelude \u2013 10 <br>Overture \u2013 7 <br>Duet \u2013 7 <br>March \u2013 7 <br>Hymn \u2013 6 <br>Sonata \u2013 6 <br>Composition \u2013 6 <br>Trio \u2013 5</p>\n\n<p>Also, there have been a number of more technical musical terms appearing with some frequency in my dreams. These are shown in Table 3, and obviously reflect upon my familiarity with the language of music and its incorporation into my dream life.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 3: Technical Terms (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Theme \u2013 63<br>Note \u2013 62<br>Movement \u2013 39<br>Bass \u2013 36<br>Key \u2013 24<br>Tenor \u2013 22<br>Rhythm \u2013 21<br>Staff \u2013 19<br>Harmony \u2013 16<br>Measure \u2013 13<br>Alto \u2013 13<br>Melody \u2013 13<br>Beat \u2013 12<br>Tone \u2013 12<br>Pitch \u2013 11<br>Lyrics \u2013 10<br>Variation \u2013 9<br>Soprano \u2013 9<br>Scale \u2013 8<br>Flat \u2013 7<br>Octave \u2013 5<br>Sharp \u2013 4 </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Music\" /></p>\n\n<p>In addition, actions of a musical nature appear in my dreams, especially playing and singing. These are shown in Table 4. (This listing does not include any non-musical instances of these verbs, such as playing games, or conducting tours.) Though I am not a profi cient vocalist, once again, singing is high on the list. Composing is rather far down on the list; while I composed a little music during high school, it is not something that I have felt motivated to do\u2026 until recently.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 4: Key Actions (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Play \u2013 298<br>Sing \u2013 143<br>Perform \u2013 49<br>Chant \u2013 33<br>Conduct \u2013 14<br>Practice \u201310<br>Hum - 10<br>Compose \u2013 6 </p>\n\n<p>A wide variety of musical instruments have appeared in my dreams, as shown in Table 5. Not surprisingly, the crumhorn and the clarinet\u2014the two instruments I actually play\u2014have a high frequency; as a crumhornist, I play with a recorder group, which might account for the frequency of recorders on the list. But I do not play piano, or any stringed or brass instruments. So their frequent appearance in my dreams would seem to derive from listening rather than playing music.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 5: Instruments (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Instrument \u2013 87<br>Piano \u2013 52<br>Crumhorn \u2013 37<br>Recorder \u2013 31<br>Clarinet \u2013 29<br>Drum \u2013 23<br>Violin \u2013 19<br>Flute \u2013 17<br>Trumpet \u2013 13<br>Guitar \u2013 12<br>Reed \u2013 11<br>Saxophone \u2013 10<br>Cello \u2013 9<br>Organ \u2013 7<br>Viola \u2013 6<br>Bassoon \u2013 6<br>Oboe \u2013 6<br>Harpsichord \u2013 6<br>Mouthpiece \u2013 6<br>Trombone \u2013 5<br>Pipe \u2013 4<br>Sitar \u2013 3<br>Tympani \u2013 3<br>Bow \u2013 3 </p>\n\n<p>The same pattern is demonstrated by the types of performers who appear in my dreams. As Table 6 shows, although wind players are near the top, singers exceed them in frequency; and other types of performers are not far behind. Much of the music I listen to is orchestral but increasingly, chamber music as well. I haven\u2019t listened to much choral music, so it\u2019s surprising that choristers appear so often. This may prefigure the developments I will discuss later in the article.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 6: Performers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Singers \u2013 40<br>Conductors \u2013 26<br>Wind Players \u2013 26<br>Orchestra \u2013 24<br>String Players \u2013 19<br>Table 6<br>Keyboardists \u2013 10<br>Music Teachers \u2013 9<br>Rock Groups \u2013 9<br>Brass Players \u2013 8<br>Bands \u2013 7<br>Jazz Musicians \u2013 6<br>Percussionists \u2013 6 </p>\n\n<p>A wide diversity of composers is represented in my dreams: 54 identifiable composers in all. Table 7 indicates all those appearing at least twice. Mahler and Wagner, who definitely rank among my favorites, are at the top of the list. However, the rest of the distribution is not entirely in accord with my waking life tastes. Some of my favorite composers \u2014 for example, Rachmaninoff and Vaughan-Williams \u2014 are very far down on the list; others, like Bruckner and Puccini, have only appeared once. With the exception of Michael Praetorius, none of the Renaissance and early Baroque composers whose music I now frequently play appear on this list. It might be suggested that the frequency of composers in my dreams is correlated with the degree to which their music impacts me emotionally \u2026 but the four Late Romantic composers I mentioned above, appeared only once or twice, and yet they wrote highly emotionally charged music.</p>\n\n<h3>Table 7: Composers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>\n\n<p><br>Gustav Mahler \u2013 35<br>Richard Wagner \u2013 25<br>Johannes Brahms \u2013 16<br>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \u2013 16<br>The Beatles \u2013 16<br>Ludwig van Beethoven \u2013 16<br>Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 12<br>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky \u2013 9<br>Felix Mendelssohn \u2013 5<br>Franz Schubert \u2013 5<br>Antonin Dvorak \u2013 4<br>Frederic Chopin \u2013 4<br>Richard Strauss \u2013 4<br>Giuseppi Verdi \u2013 4<br>Jan Sibelius \u2013 3<br>Franz Josef Haydn \u2013 3<br>Michael Praetorius \u2013 3<br>Robert Schumann - 3<br>Leonard Bernstein-3<br>Edvard Grieg \u2013 2<br>Bob Dylan \u2013 2<br>Percy Grainger - 2<br>Georg Frederick Handel \u2013 2<br>Johann Pachelbel \u2013 2<br>Sergei Rachmaninoff \u2013 2<br>Camille Saint-Saens \u2013 2<br>Dmitri Shostakovich - 2<br>Ralph Vaughan-Williams \u2013 2<br>Carl Maria von Weber \u2013 2<br>plus 29 others \u2013 1 each </p>\n\n<p>As I reported in DNJ V29#3, during the summer of 2010 I read Jung\u2019s Red Book and it had a profound effect upon my consciousness. Themes from the book frequently appeared in my dreams and waking synchronous experience, and in dreams, often prior to my reading them. The \u201Cbiggest\u201D dream in this series concerned my observation of a group of choristers performing an a capella cantata based upon texts from the Red Book. Upon awakening, I realized that the texts derived from the \u201CIncantations\u201D section of the book, in which Jung presents a series of prayers within his dreaming that was directed to the Babylonian hero Gilgamesh, whom he had previously (in the dream) mortally wounded then saved, by collapsing him to miniscule size and placing him within an egg, which he brought to a village for incubation.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequent dreaming has made it clear to me that I have been asked to compose this cantata out of themes my dreaming presents to me. Even though I had no formal education in musical composition, I agreed to undertake this project. The first stage was to translate the words of the Incantations from German into Akkadian, the actual language of the Gilgamesh epic. My training in ancient Near Eastern languages has made it possible for me to accomplish this. Next, I am applying to the Incantations section text the specific musical themes derived from my dreams.</p>\n\n<p>My dreams indicated that the cantata would be sung a capella by four voices, and that it would be in 6 sections. In order to manifest this, I have audited two Music Theory courses this year, which enabled me to set the melodies my dreams gave me within a tonal harmonic structure. Far from easy!</p>\n\n<p>The first section I was moved to set to music is associated with a powerful Red Book image (Jung 2009:55): the sun barque of the Egyptian god Ra sailing over the surface of the waters, beneath which lurks a monstrous fi sh, identified by Jung as the \u201CSpirit of the Depths.\u201D The text consists of four lines and the melody for it was given to me in a dream. Translated into English, these are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One word, which has never yet been spoken; </p>\n  \n  <p>One light, which has not yet shone; </p>\n  \n  <p>One confusion, without equal; </p>\n  \n  <p>And one road, without end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-3.jpg\" alt=\"Music spiral\" /></p>\n\n<p>Underlying the text, the Akkadian words for \u201CSpirit of the Depths\u201D are intoned as an undulating pedal, representing the waves. In addition, singers from time to time hold long notes on \u201Ca,\u201D which is the Sumerian word for water. </p>\n\n<p>The piece is in four sections, each of which corresponds to one of the four lines of the text. The first section picks up the theme of \u201Cone word\u201D from the dream, as each line is sung solo above the bass pedal, first by the tenor, then by the alto, then by the soprano, then again by the tenor. </p>\n\n<p>In the second section, the melody is taken up by the sopranos, harmonized by the altos, while the tenors sing the pedal and the basses harmonize beneath them. This corresponds to the \u201Cone light\u201D phrase. </p>\n\n<p>In the third, \u201Cconfusion\u201D section, the sopranos sing arpeggios while the altos hold the pedal and the tenors sing the melody, harmonized by the basses. </p>\n\n<p>The fourth, \u201Croad\u201D section, the sopranos sing descending road-like quarter notes while the altos harmonize, the tenors hold the pedal and the basses have the melody. There is a brief coda in which the pedal finally reaches the water\u2019s surface with the soprano line and then works its way down through the voices. </p>\n\n<p>This piece was premiered at the 2011 IASD conference to a receptive audience. A second section of the cantata was performed in August of 2011 at the same music camp that provided the inspiration for the original dream that \u201Ccommissioned\u201D the cantata. </p>\n\n<p>Since I undertook the writing of the cantata, dreams about it have come in profusion. I have had 47 dreams in which the cantata was featured, 35 providing musical themes. In 11 of these, I have actually visualized the notes on the staff; more often, I just hear the themes. Most of these dreams are just brief snippets\u2026 or the theme occurs only at the end of a longer dream. Some dreams have provided me with insights into the structure of the cantata or helped me to revise what I have written. I know that there are themes that I have not been able to recall in the morning, but one dream early in the process informed me that these are being stored in my unconscious for when I will need them later on. </p>\n\n<p>The creative process sometimes takes unexpected twists and turns; for example, the section performed last summer combines two dream themes in a canonical structure. I had no idea that the second theme would fi t the fi rst as well as it does. An early dream indicated that I would need to incorporate a chorale from Bach\u2019s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> into one section of the cantata. Recent dreams have shown me that this will actually be in a rondo form, with several repeats of the chorale interspersed with other dream themes. A section I am working on now contrasts a vigorous hora rhythm from one dream against a more melodic pastoral theme from another. As Jung observed of the paintings which accompany his dreams in the <em>Red Book</em>, sometimes they didn\u2019t come out the way he expected! </p>\n\n<p>In many instances, I have no idea with what portion of the cantata the themes will go. But in other cases, I get the words with the music. My knowledge of music enables me to see that some of the themes bear a relationship to existing music. But other themes are unfamiliar and hopefully my dreams will give me more! \u2118</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a language older by far and deeper than words. It is the language of bodies, of bodies on body, wind on snow, rain on trees, wave on stone. It is the language of dreams, gesture, symbol, memory and music. We have forgotten the language. We do not even remember that it exists.\u201D - A Language Older than Words, Derrick Jensen</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-4.jpg\" alt=\"Hoffman\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hoffman, Curtiss 2005 A Call to Music!

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfimpp> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><strong>THE OLD MAN</strong> was still working. He had enough money and didn\u2019t need to work, but working was a part of him. He dimly realized that his sparkle of existence fueled by over half a century of work was dying. He needed to know if his illusory passion for a different kind of work was real or only an empty excuse to stop working altogether. </p>\n\n<p>His thoughts floated on the mist of awareness into a dream where\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A slender, almost shapeless woman covered in silence appears before him. Her features dissolve, leaving only the sheen and smooth perfection of her short, silvery-white hair. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The dream woman was important. She was to be his comfort, his source of reassurance that he needed to give energy to a new dream. She would be able to release him from his worries, the worries of many elders: that their potential for making a mark in the world will be denied them in this new world of speeding change that defies comprehension. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Time is visibly absent. Neither the old man nor the woman disturbs the stillness. They just stand opposite one another, seeing each other, but with no exchange of any kind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>THE TIRED, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN</strong> had just changed careers. She had emerged from the stifling cocoon of a corporate management position to pursue a new life. With adrenalin-charged power, she worked her way through a grueling graduate education program right along side quick learning students in there twenties. She emerged victorious with a master\u2019s degree, enormous debts, and only a part time job. As she drifts into dreams, she looks forward to seeing her grandfather again. In the comfort and silence of their meetings, their love for each other eclipses the need for any talk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE YOUNG MAN IN HIS THIRTIES</strong> feels invincible. His power and vision are as yet unchallenged by the need to overcome the inevitabilities of future discouragement and pain. Dreams provide him with strong counselors and teachers whose advice and answers he knows will ensure success in his all-encompassing endeavors. </p>\n\n<p><strong>THE LITTLE GIRL</strong> is spritely, engaging, and well cared for. She is growing up as she weaves her way through a world of confusing mirages, unspoken rights and wrongs, and the inconsistencies of adult behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>In dreams ...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She bravely meets the frightening and comforting lady in blue who returns night after night to stand by her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We usually consider archetypal figures\u2014which are there to help\u2014as being most important in our dreams\u2026 but they are not the only ones. Who we draw into our dreams as guides and helpers is influenced by our personal history and our stage of life. </p>\n\n<p>The size of emerging problems, our belief system, our intentions for direction in life, and unconscious drives all combine to govern who will show up in dreamtime to assist us. </p>\n\n<p>Even more so than in waking life, those who come to us in dreams allow us to grow spiritually. Respecting our gift of free will, they rarely tell us what to do. Their unstated perspective is a universal one that transcends the needs of the dreamer\u2019s ego and focuses on the collective Whole. </p>\n\n<p>The more we consider the seemingly simplistic question of who is the most important person in our dreams, the more complex the question becomes. Adding to the complexity is the fact that we ourselves are participants in our dreams - if sometimes only as unseen observers. </p>\n\n<p>With the realization that the power of the universe embodied in love can be focused on us as we dream, we are drawn to an awareness of our own deep value. The dream in all of its quiet, veiled power comes to celebrate us as half-asleep dreamers, who when awake can be enormously vital and important contributors to the welfare of Humanity. </p>\n\n<p>So we might then conclude that the most important person in your dreams very well may be <em>YOU!</em> \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3atki> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Website: <a href=\"http://camerawilltravel.com/\">camerawilltravel.com</a></p>\n\n<p>My career started as a photojournalist for a weekly town newspaper. My style has evolved to include nature, dreamscapes, landscapes, and travel &amp; tourism. I\u2019ve been awarded grants and won awards for my imagery, and have exhibited on both coasts of the United States.</p>\n\n<p><em>Photography Then\u2013</em> My first \u201Creal job\u201D was at a local newspaper in my hometown. After talking with the editor, he gave me a few photo assignments on a trial basis. A month into this new photojournalist position, I had my first of many front page photos.  It meant lugging 50 pounds of camera equipment through seventeen local communities on assignment for human interest and breaking news stories (and through all types of crazy New England weather, too!) I stayed with the newspaper for 7 years before enrolling in computer training school.</p>\n\n<p>My formal art training at Rhode Island School of Design included alternative photographic processes and design.</p>\n\n<p><em>Photography Now \u2013</em> I have been exploring the links between art, visual therapy, and the realities of the dream state for many years. My work, while being a deeply personal exploration of my own dreams, jars the viewer with its beauty of light interplay, form, and design. Its my intention to create a tactile beauty that brings viewers into my private world while simultaneously giving one the permission to touch, feel, and experience each piece, while making it part of his/her own world, language, and life.</p>\n\n<p>I take a very \u201CZen\u201D / organic approach in creating recognizable images that strike a resonate chord. My approach to making photos is a quietly hidden metaphor for the ever changing fluidity of our dreams and frailty of beauty. A haunting reminder of how both shimmer before us, but can disappear in the blink of an eye. An eternal aide memoir that everything is not always as it appears to be.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

One particular poet and one particular Dreamer come together on a joint venture of mutual interest and the result is Robert Moss\u2019s <em>The Dreamer\u2019s Book of the Dead: A Soul Traveler\u2019s Guide to Death, Dying and the Other Side</em>. Divided into three distinct and interconnected sections, The Dreamer\u2019s Book of the Dead offers what could very well be the beginnings of a much needed Book of the Dead for the Western (industrialized) world. </p>\n\n<p>Two of Moss\u2019s strongest points are that Imagination is a necessary and vital element of the afterlife\u2014and\u2014dreaming is our most direct access to learning about and preparing for life after physical death. But Western culture tends to view Imagination with the same suspicious and disapproving eye it uses on dreams/dreaming. Consequently, our understanding of the afterlife is vague, incomplete, and constricted. Both the dead and the living in Western culture suffer from a lack of information. This book endeavors to provide some practical tools and guidelines to \u201Chelp us heal our relationship with death and dying.\u201D It is a relationship sorely in need of healing. The first section, <em>Dreaming with the Departed</em>, draws on dreams and tales of the afterlife from other cultures as well as contemporary dream reports. While reminiscent of Patricia Garfield\u2019s <em>The Dream Messenger</em>, Moss offers an expanded view of this type of dream. He explores not just the common themes and messages in such dreams but also lays a foundation for deeper and more conscious dialogues/interactions between living and dead. Yes, the dead visit us in our world, via dreams, but we visit them in their world as well, gaining our own glimpses into the bardos beyond. There is a process, a path, a pattern to the afterlife, and different kinds of energy and consciousness survive physical death. Sometimes the dead need help from the living. Many don\u2019t know they have died, for instance, or we hold them too close or too long and they remain earthbound longer than they might have otherwise, or they don\u2019t know (because of beliefs held during physical life) that they <strong>can</strong> go on. Dreaming of the dead is part of the dying/death/healing process for both the living and the dead and Moss offers specific suggestions for the living which assist both living and dead \u2013 not just \u2018feel good\u2019 rituals, but practical matters such as sudden or violent deaths, unburied/missing bodies, the dense energy body of the \u2018stuck\u2019 dead, entanglement with this denser energy, etc.. Moss reiterates the necessity of imagination in the afterlife (\u201C\u2026lack of imagination is one of the main reasons people get stuck on the other side of death\u201D). It is the key to a deeper dialogue between the living and dead, and a necessary element in a Western Book of the Dead. Ultimately, Western culture benefits from a more active and conscious communion with the other side of the veil. </p>\n\n<p>If <em>The Dreamers Book of the Dead</em> stopped after Part One, it would still be a valuable addition to any dreamworker\u2019s library. It doesn\u2019t stop, of course, but continues with an exploration of The Poet as Guide to the Other Side. Here, Moss describes his interactions with and guidance by the spirit of W. B. Yeats, an early Twentieth Century poet whose own efforts at writing a Western Book of the Dead resulted in <em>A Vision</em> (1925 &amp; 1937). He learns more about the afterlife through a variety of experiences (dreaming, shamanic drumming/journeying, travels to and visits from others who had died, etc.), with Yeats as his guide much as Virgil was Dante\u2019s guide. There are numerous references to other individuals and groups who have traveled this path in earlier times (the Victorian era, for example). This section provides much of the larger context which ties the other two sections together. Throughout the whole of the book, as well, are poems and stories from other cultures which further bring us from where we are to where we could be in our own culture\u2019s relationship to death and dying. </p>\n\n<p>Dreaming the Way from Death to Birth is where we are headed in finally creating a Western Book of the Dead. Here are tools and guidance to help us truly begin to heal that relationship with death/dying. By learning (and helping others learn) how to prepare/maintain our personal \u2018houses of death\u2019, we can be ready when it is our turn. Stories from many dreamers and many traditions, as well as descriptions of Moss\u2019s own experiences and what he has learned, make up much of this section. Several short meditations are offered as examples to help in visualizing different ways of starting on your journey after death. A brief summary of common \u2018steps\u2019 found on the other side is also given, though individual experience will, of course, be shaped by one\u2019s own beliefs and expectations about what is on the other side. Reincarnation is touched on as well, as are some other \u2018non-western\u2019 concepts (being alive in more than one time period at once, for example). </p>\n\n<p>At the end of his book, Moss offers additional resources, provides a description of his Dream Re-entry technique (most helpful in further exploring those dreams with the dead), and presents a very extensive bibliography with authors both ancient and modern and in a variety of fields (including Garfield\u2019s Dream Messager). This may not be the final incarnation of a Western Book of the Dead, but The Dreamer\u2019s Book of the Dead a really nice start. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zwater> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post_bcpov6zwater_0.jpg\" alt=\"Dream collage\" /></p>\n\n<p>In looking at my dreams, I often see reflections of my negative actions, thoughts, and feelings. By examining them closely and being completely honest with myself, I\u2019ve come to discover who I am, why I am who I am, and more importantly, who I am meant to be. This is an ongoing and continuing process; I am forever changing for the better, which is also reflected in my dreams. This became evident a few months ago when I had a dream that I titled, \u201CAnother Tidal Wave,\u201D which reminded me of a previously recurring dream titled, \u201CWater, Water Everywhere.\u201D A comparison of the two was very revealing. </p>\n\n<h3>Water, Water Everywhere</h3>\n\n<p><em>I am at the beach, alone. I savor the peace and quiet as the warm surf rolls under my feet tugging gently at my ankles. Suddenly, the water is up to my knees and I find it difficult to walk. I head for shore and I am scared. The shore gets further and further away and the water gets higher and higher.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>I see a building in the distance and I know that I must reach it or I will drown. My heart pounds in my chest, as the water continues to get higher and higher. I find myself at the door of the building. I look behind me; the water is about to overtake me. I open the door and make it inside. I know that I am safe.</em> </p>\n\n<p>I look around; the building is empty. I go to a small window and see the water is above the window line. The building is submerged in water, yet I feel safe. The above was a recurring dream I had for over 20 years, starting when I was about 12 years old. It was always the same for many years. At some point, I began to notice a few (one at first, then two or three) other people in the building. When I was about thirty-two years old or so, the window seemed to get larger and larger -- until the walls were literally made of glass, at which point the dreams stopped. I have not had this dream for over fifteen years now. </p>\n\n<p>To understand the interpretation, you should know that there were several incidents in my adolescence that I repressed -- in other words, locked away deep in my unconscious. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The Ocean signifies that the dream is referring to my unconscious. The water is overtaking me and I am afraid that unless I go inside the building, I will drown. If the water symbolizes my emotions, then the fear of drowning indicates that I was afraid that my emotions would overwhelm me. Therefore, I needed to find shelter from these emotions and went inside the building \u2014inside of myself. </p>\n\n<p>At first, I was alone in the building. At some point, I became aware of other people. These other \u201Cpeople\u201D were actually me. For each repressed incident that occurred in my life, another part of \u201Cme\u201D went \u201Cinside\u201D where it was safe. </p>\n\n<p>The window allowed me a glimpse of the emotions (the \u201Cwater\u201D) that I was afraid of. In the beginning, the window was very small, and seeing the water going over the top of it, reinforced my belief that going inside the shelter was the right thing to do--it saved me. The window got larger and larger as I matured and learned how to deal with these emotions that I repressed for so long. In the end, the walls were completely transparent. I no longer needed to hide in the building, as I was no longer afraid of drowning in my emotions. So, the dreams stopped. </p>\n\n<h3>Another Tidal Wave</h3>\n\n<div class=\"media-item resp-container\"><iframe class=\"resp-iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EilI5nTha6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p><em>I am on a balcony overlooking a beach. I know that I am not alone. To my left is my \u201Cguide\u201D and to my right, I sense two or three women, though I do not see them. Out on the beach I see several people walking. I look out to the ocean and see a huge tidal wave approaching the shore. I start yelling at the people on the beach to run for safety. Then I see a baby on the edge of the surf, alone. I point to the baby and yell at the people to, \u201CSave the baby, save the baby!\u201D Everyone runs off and leaves the baby on the shore alone with the tidal wave getting closer.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>The scene shifts slightly. Now I am on the balcony with these same women and my guide, only we are completely underwater, though I am not afraid. I see a scorpion drift by. One of the \u201Cwomen\u201D warns me to be careful as it might sting, but I am drawn to the scorpion and reach out my hand to touch it. It stings me on my palm. I look at my palm, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. I know that I will be OK. The scene shifts again. We have moved inside and I hear a Special News Bulletin on the TV. The announcer is saying, \u201CTidal wave hits beach, baby dies.\u201D</em> I wake up. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The similarities to my earlier, recurring Water, Water Everywhere dream are apparent; however there are significant differences. While the beach, ocean and the impending wave are similar and symbolize the same things, my viewpoint, or perspective, is different. In the original dream, I am on the beach and the danger is imminent. In the new dream, I am able to view the impending tidal wave from a higher, safer perspective--a clear sign to me of personal growth. In the original dream, I must seek shelter, or hide. Here, I feel no need to run or hide. Also, in the original dream, I am inside the building with the water all around, while in the more recent one, I remain outside on a balcony, outside of myself (the building); and even when the water overtakes me, I am unafraid and I know I am not alone. The scorpion stings me but I am not hurt. </p>\n\n<p>It so happens that my partner in life and dreams, Bob Van de Castle, is a Scorpio. I know he will not hurt me \u2013 and no matter what emotional upheaval occurs, he will be there and I know I will be OK.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement that the baby dies might seem, at first, to be negative or dangerous, but (if the baby signifies an immature part of me, then the baby <em>dying</em> means that this part of me has matured, or I am no longer in need of it. The baby has died and in its place is a mature woman ready to accept and deal with whatever comes -- and I am not alone. </p>\n\n<p>It was only in comparing the recent dream to the older dream that I was able to completely understand and appreciate how far I have come over the years. I am grateful for my dreams and the messages they provide. I know I am on the right path. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3bayl> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>\"Just when you thought nothing new could be written about dreams, Janice Baylis has applied chaos theory and complexity theory to dream interpretation. Her suggestions are grounded in cutting edge paradigms.\" Stanley Krippner, PhD. Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University</p>\n\n<p>How I, Janice Baylis, got interested in dreams: In 1959 a fellow teacher had major surgery. We set up a car pool where I picked her up in a strip mall parking lot and drove the 30 miles to our school.  One morning Mabel phoned and asked me to meet her around the corner on the residential street.  She said she didn't like her car taking up space in the store lot all day. </p>\n\n<p>I said, \"Okay.\"</p>\n\n<p>As Mabel was getting into my car that morning, we heard an enormous CRASH!  A small airplane had landed upside down in the corner of the parking lot where we would have been.  Then she told me she had dreamed it during the night. \"WOW!\" exclaimed my eight year old son, Brad, from the backseat.</p>\n\n<p>That launched me on a life-long, self-directed and academic study of dreams. From the first, the practical side of dreaming has been my focus.  The Edgar Cayce dream material was the first I found to study.  He also emphasized the practical aspects--health, finances, job, creativity, and interpersonal, as well as the personality growth and spiritual aspects.</p>\n\n<p>With my BA degree in Education and a MA degree in Psychology, I got a credential/license to teach dream-study at the community college level.  I taught 36 hour, semester, night classes and weekend workshops.  My students urged me to write a book, so I wrote Sleep On It! The Practical Side of Dreaming in 1977. </p>\n\n<p>In my teaching I found many dreams use overt sexual imagery and that people were confused by the symbolism of sexual images.  I made this a secondary focus of my dream work.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfheal> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>People are becoming increasingly health conscious. Dreams, however, are often overlooked as a potential aid to good health. The following account of a persistent health problem shows how dreams can be called upon to provide continuing health care information.</p>\n\n<p>The situation has a history that begins over twenty years ago when I had my first hangnail infection. A hangnail may sound like a minor problem, but the infection was resistant to medical treatment and led to hospitalization. A surgeon removed the infected tissue including the bone tuft. This procedure was effective, but left me with a smaller fingertip. Years later, a similar infection in another finger was treated on an outpatient basis. The result of this treatment was a healed finger that included a hard, sensitive scar tissuelike projection near the nail. I learned that serious risks accompany traditional medical care of such infections. </p>\n\n<p>On December 1, 1984, I recognized the beginning of another hangnail, this time in the original, slightly shrunken, left index finger. It was during a period of considerable stress. I had left full time employment to complete my doctoral program in psychology. My resistance to infection was down. I was also dealing with the residual effects of flu along with persistent middle ear fluid buildup problems. In the intervening years, however, I had adopted a more wholistic life view and this time decided to take more direct treatment responsibility. I began with a small castor oil-soaked bandage. Castor oil is reported to facilitate the healing process.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/5.6-strock-1.jpg\" alt=\"hand\" /></p>\n\n<p>The next morning I had the first in a series of dreams related to the finger. The dream confirmed the fact that I had a \"hangnail\" and would riot be seen as a \"good patient\" by conventional medical doctors. Several days later, the swelling had Increased and the finger was very sensitive to touch. I wrote in my dream journal, \"Help, I'm scared.\" I feared surgery, a medically accepted treatment of choice. I could imagine what the surgeon would cut now that the bone tuft was gone. I did not want to chance losing more of the finger. Neither did I want the expense, risk, or time away from my academic work that traditional medical care would require. I now actively sought help from my dreams. </p>\n\n<p>I interpreted an unclear dream as an indication I should see a doctor. So, on the next day, December 10th, I saw a doctor. He recommended that I discontinue my castor oil treatment, but continue with epsom salt soaks accompanied by an antibiotic ointment. I followed his advice and added visual imagery exercises to encourage the infection coming to a head, so the doctor could cut the upper skin and release the resulting pus. </p>\n\n<p>A frightening dream came the day after I saw the doctor. In the dream, I took a piece of wood my grandfather handed me and noticed that it had termites in one section. I banged the wood on the ground and watched the termites come out, go Into a pile and then die from exposure. I then smashed the Queen and one other termite. To me, the termites in the wood represented infection in the bone. I knew that bone infections are notoriously resistant to treatment. Fear prevented me from seeing positive aspects of the dream. </p>\n\n<p>I became obsessed with the infection. I got my name added to a prayer group listing. I began calling friends asking for their prayers. One friend, who is especially psychic, called back moments after my call. He had been meditating when I called, returned to the meditative state and asked for advice on my behalf. The recommendation which came to him was accompanied by a brilliant white light. I should use a castor oil pack. I was familiar with castor oil packs and had been using one before the doctor recommended I stop. </p>\n\n<p>I got castor oil soaked wool felt and made a total finger pack which I used with heat for an hour and a half two times a day. My psychic friend called a couple of times during the next two days and mentioned he had also gotten the recommendation that 1 use epsom salt soaks followed by a cleansing with lemon oil; that I would see improvement in from three to six days. I followed this advice, but wasn't sure what form the \"improvement\" would take. The swelling began to increase and was now accompanied by redness and subsurface yellow pus which began to spread around the base of the nail. Seven worrisome days after my friend's initial recommendation I actively sought dream guidance that I could understand. I awoke with a vague impression of perforation of the skin -the idea that if I found a preparation that would help to draw out the infection at this point, that would be helpful. </p>\n\n<p>The following day, December 18th, I saw the doctor for the second time. He carefully cut the surface layer of skin, drained off the pus and applied antbiotic ointment. The finger improved dramatically. I was more relieved than I had been in days. I was able to reflect on my consuming fears of pain, surgery, and possible failure of my wholistic measures. I got insight regarding how I developed the very fearful side of myself. I realized the powerful impact of fear and toned for situations where I had caused fear in others. I could now relax. </p>\n\n<p>The respite was short lived. Ten days after the doctor's treatment, I dreamed: I saw an index finger with the little flap of skin turned back to expose pus. </p>\n\n<p>I checked my finger carefully and noticed pus around the base of the nail. The infection had come back to life. I resumed ointment and castor oil treatment. I anxiously sought dream information. The resulting dreams indicated a connection between the infection and my overly strong preoccupation with it. It was difficult to reduce my preoccupation since I was constantly reminded of the problem by the ever present protective bandage and the fact that I typed several hours each day. Nevertheless, my finger did improve noticeably. Two months after the onset, it looked healed but was still extremely sensitive and barely sable. I had the doctor check it. He assured me that the finger was fine and that I had healed quickly. I knew the finger was not fine. </p>\n\n<p>The sensitivity continued. Once again, I resumed the castor oil treatments and requested dream guidance. My answering dream included a scene where I got castor oil all over my trousers and could not find anything to wipe it off with - hardly a positive recommendation for continued castor oil use. A few days later a dream made reference to a crayfish biting one of the fingers of my right hand. The possibility of the dream being related to the problems with my left index finger were unclear. Another dream reference occurred a few days later when I dreamed of wrestling with someone \"in play, but must be careful of my finger.\" This last dream was dramatic and revitalized fears for my finger. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/5.6-strock-2.jpg\" alt=\"hand\" /></p>\n\n<p>The question was, if castor oil were not indicated, then what could I do to provide effective treatment? In desperation I began an intense search for treatment clues that included every medical reference I owned, including: <em>Conn's Therapy</em>, the <em>Merck Manual</em>, and wholistic health sources. As a result of my haH day search, I decided to use lodex, a topical preparation I had never used before. I called a store and reserved a jar, planning to pick it up the next day. That night, my dreams came alive. The following dream on February 19, 1985 was a breakthrough: </p>\n\n<p><em>I'm looking into a school yard fenced with chain link fence. In a leanto-like shelter are two college friends sitting in a special mud. It is a life experiment! I recalled having difficulty \"getting\" the name of the mud. Finally I got it - ICHTHYOL.</em></p>\n\n<p>By the time I was fully awake, I recognized lchthyol as a medication I had react about the day before. I did not associate it with my finger, but thought that the dream was somehow related to my ear problems for which I was also soliciting help from my dreams. I later reread the description, noticed a functional similarity to lodex, and then made the connection. As indicated in the dream, it was difficult \"to get.\" lchthyol is the trade name of a discontinued product - a drawing salve. I did locate the medication under its generic name, ichthammol, and began using it immediately. Surprise! It smelled and looked like mud. I was fascinated and read more about it. The descriptions warned about becoming reliant on such preparations. I slowed down my use of the product. A dream responded by pointing out the spiritual nature of dream guidance and its relevence to my current problem. I resumed full use of the ichthammol. </p>\n\n<p>Three months after the first indication of a problem, I was shocked by the following dream's power and lightning fast action. </p>\n\n<p><em>I'm the lead character on stage in a play. The fellow who designed the play pushed a sword through my lapel and on through my finger. Just as quickly, he withdrew it. I looked down and was surprised to see that it didn't hurt. He had done it expertly. later, I looked at the wound. Each opening had healed, although of course it was still healing inside. I thought about putting salt water on it, but didn't think it needed it.</em></p>\n\n<p>My immediate reaction was: IT WAS A CLEAN CUT. THE FINGER WAS HEALED. </p>\n\n<p>In my joy of realizing the infection was gone, I neglected the statements about continued healing and salt water. Continued finger stiffness renewed my concerns. On March 14, 1985, came the last dream of the series; simply an impression that all the finger needed was exercise. Careful exercise soon brought my finger back to full use.</p>\n\n<p>Overlooked dream clues and encouragement became apparent in a later review of the log. The critical use of a drawing salve in the Jast phases of treatment was indicated by a couple of early dreams. The reference to my grandfather was undoubtedly related to his frequent use of a \"drawing salve\" as treatment for job-related metal splinters. Another dream referred to a \"preparation that would help draw out the infection\" long before the mud experiment dream. Other uninterpretted symbols undoubtedly hold a wealth of untapped information. Dreams clearly played a helpful, dynamic andmultifaceted role in the entire healing process.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

You may be too young to remember, but it seems the earth did just fine in those days.  The earth gave birth to an incredible, rich diversity of life, and yet maintained a delicate, sustainable balance between it all.  Even in the early days of human life, it seemed that we could be part of this magical balance as we found our niche and explored our possibilities.  Sure, we made mistakes in those days, but we could usually learn from those mistakes and try to do better in the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>But recently the humans seem to be acting like the worst kind of invasive species, spreading all over the planet, dominating, killing and destroying everything in sight.  The delicate balance of life has been seriously disrupted by humans.  What is happening here?  Will the humans finally win their war against nature and thus destroy all chance for balance to be restored?   What will it take for humans to change our ways, to strive again for some kind of balance?</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

He has been involved with the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) for over 25 years. Through this organization, he has enjoyed the benefit of multidiscipline dream work expertise from around the world. He is a past president of IASD and has hosted multiple international dream conferences. He is a graduate of the two-year Dream Leader Training program offered by The Haden Institute in Charlotte. It was here that he gained much of his knowledge of Jungian archetypes. He was ordained through Sancta Sophia Seminary in Oklahoma's modern day wisdom school. The seminary opened his eyes to the relationships between dreams, astrology, and the ancient wisdom teachings.</p>\n\n<p>Robert has a Master of Arts degree in guidance and counseling from Wayne State University in Detroit. He has also completed a year of Ph.D. level work in spiritual studies.</p>\n\n<p>As early as 1970, He was organizing and leading dream discussion groups. His first was when he was serving with the United States Air Force in Turkey. Since then, he has conducted workshops on dreams in the Metropolitan D.C. area and in North Carolina. He designed a four-part mini course on dreams, which was well received in Asheville, NC. It was in these courses and workshops that he fully realized the importance of themes in the dream work process and the need for formal guidelines on the subject. He has found that themes are the most misunderstood aspect of dream work.</p>\n\n<p>He is the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Exploration-Approach-Robert-Gongloff/dp/0738708186\">Dream Exploration: A New Approach</a>, which helps dreamers identify the core \"theme\" - the \"heart\" - of the dream; and is co-editor of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-That-Change-Our-Lives/dp/1630514292\">IASD book, Dreams that Change Our Lives</a>, and the second volume of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Dreams-Understanding-Biology-Psychology-Culture/dp/1440856168\">Dreams: Understanding Biology, Psychology, and Culture</a>.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcphbq3pimm> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Website: <a href=\"http://notesfromadreamer.com\">notesfromadreamer.com</a></p>\n\n<p>I am a dreamworker and author of Notes From a Dreamer \u2026 on Dreaming: A Personal Journey in Dream Interpretation. My current focus is on teaching others how to interpret and work with their own dreams. I have created several <a href=\"https://theazire.org/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11\">online courses on dream interpretation</a>. I am also available to do workshops and one-on-one consultations via phone or Skype.</p>\n\n<p>My interest in dreams began in 1988, after I left my husband of 13 years.  At that time, two dreams kept recurring over and over again; dreams which I had since I was 12. I knew these dreams were trying to tell me something, but didn\u2019t know just what. In 1994, I discovered the book, Our Dreaming Mind, by Dr. Robert L. Van de Castle, which helped me understand the process of dreaming.  With further reading and research, I began to slowly learn to decipher my dreams.</p>\n\n<p>I have been actively enlightening others online about dreams since 2001, when I created my original Notes From a Dreamer \u2026 on Dreaming website to share my experience of learning to interpret my own dreams. Then, in late September 2008, I connected with Dr. Robert Van de Castle at an online PsiberDreaming Conference put on by the <a href=\"http://asdreams.org/\">International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD)</a>.  A few short weeks, several lengthy phone calls and numerous emails later, I left New Jersey and moved to Charlottesville, VA to live and work with him until his passing in January 2014. Working closely with Dr. Van de Castle, we created and taught an online course for Atlantic University, Becoming a Teacher of Dreamwork/Dream Interpretation. We also presented together at several conferences and co-authored an article for Explore! journal, <a href=\"http://www.explorejournal.com/article/S1550-8307(10)00099-6/abstract\">Dreams As a Multidimensional Expression of PSI</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am an active member of the IASD for over 15 years and an elected member of the Board of Directors from 2014-2017. As such, I adhere to their <a href=\"http://www.asdreams.org/ethics-and-confidentiality/\">ethical guidelines in dreamworking</a> which \u201Csupports an approach to dreamwork and dream sharing that respects the dreamer\u2019s dignity and integrity, and which recognizes the dreamer as the decision-maker regarding the significance of the dream.\u201D In other words, only the dreamer knows what their dream means. My goal in life is to help you learn to understand what yours are saying to you.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that our dreams are the key to becoming more aware of who we are, why we are who we are and who we are supposed to be. If you care to join me, I\u2019d like to help you learn to interpret your dreams as I have learned to do.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zchaot> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zchaot-0.jpg\" alt=\"Krippner in Brazil\"></p>\n\n<p>A myth can be described in many ways but the metaphor of a \"chaotic attractor\" is especially suitable. In chaos theory, there are several types of \"attractors\" but a \"chaotic attractor\" finds order in what appears to be incomprehensible data by helping us to discern an underlying pattern. In much the same way, a myth can organize a constellation of beliefs, images, emotions, motives, and values that can, in turn, bring order and direction to a society, an institution, a family, a person, or to an entire culture. From a psychological perspective, a myth is an imaginative narrative (usually expressed in words but sometimes expressed in dance, images, etc.) that addresses existential human concerns, and that has behavioral consequences. Myths are more imaginative (more accurately, \"imaginal\") than empirical, and this is where a mythic narrative differs from an empirical scientific narrative. Empirical science, despite its successes in explaining the workings of natural phenomena, is virtually incapable of fulfilling the other functions that myth has provided over . the millennia - assisting the passage of individuals through the life cycle with rituals and ceremonies (e.g. ways in which myths are \"performed\"), identifying a person's place in the social world of work, love, and play, as well as helping him or her to link with the world of spirit, of the \"ground of being,\" or of ultimate value.</p>\n\n<p>This essay will use these perspectives on myth (one covert, one overt) to present, for the first time, a particular transcription of a portion of oral mythology. We were honored to be allowed to record these stories during a trip to Salvador, Bahia, Brazil in 1997 where Cau Trigo, a young Brazilian man working with the Kariri Xuco tribe introduced us to Tinze, the \"Nhenti\" or \"Keeper of the Traditions.\"</p>\n\n<h2>The History of the Tribe</h2>\n\n<p>The Kariri Xuco' are a coastal tribe in the Brazilian northeast (Novaes da Mota, 1987). In the 13th and 14th centuries, the warriors of the Tupi tribe pushed the Kariri Xuco' from most of their coastal land into the interior. They now live along the west side of the San Francisco River, the second largest in Brazil, after the Amazon, with which it does not connect. Hydroelectric projects interfere with the tribe's water supply, badly needed for fishing and irrigation. Only 10% of the land they presently occupy is now legally owned by the tribe itself, the remaining property being subject to state and federal regulation and utilization.</p>\n\n<p>This process of losing control of the land and, therefore, their destiny, began during the days of colonization. The Portuguese made slaves of the Tupi Indians, and the European historians called them the first people of the coast, not knowing that the Tupi had supplanted the Kariri Xuco' before the Portuguese arrived. It took a century for the Portuguese to locate the Kariri Xuco'. With the advent of colonization, the federation of northeast Indian groups disintegrated. The Kariri Xuco', whose culture had not recovered from their ejection from a coastal area to a dryer river area, were further destabilized by the Portuguese.</p>\n\n<p>There were bloody skirmishes between the Indians and the colonizers. Hoping to reduce expenditures on war, the Portuguese brought Capuchin priests from France as well as Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to pacify the region. This plan succeeded but resulted in the loss of much of the Kariri Xuco' culture.</p>\n\n<h2>Personal History of Tinze</h2>\n\n<p>Tinze told us that he had always had an interest in the myths of his tribe. But when a child attempts to listen to the tales told by tribal elders, the custom is to tell the child to go away. Only a child with determination will respond by saying that he or she wants to stay and listen. Tinze was one of these children. In addition, he often pretended to be asleep while the elders were telling stories. He still remembers the state of consciousness he fell into during those hours- a mixture of relaxation induced by having his eyes closed, alertness needed to hear the stories, and fear of being discovered.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, Tinze gradually won the confidence of his elders. Little by little, he was given tasks and responsibilities. As he was successful in each of his missions, he gained more access to the stories along with new responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>In his early 30s at the time of our interview, Tinze told us, \"From the time I was a child, I have been interested in tribal stories, and eventually I committed myself to the recovery of the Kariri Xuco' culture. I could see how a revival of these stories could stop the loss of our culture. Once I had attained sufficient wisdom, the elders listened to my ideas to reconnect members of our tribe with the spirits, with nature, and with each other.\" Now Tinze is the tribe's \"Nheneti\" or \"Keeper of Traditions.\" This position involves secretarial work, representing the tribe to the outside world, communicating with tribal counselors and heads of families, as well as with the tribe's chief and shaman.</p>\n\n<p>Tinze told us that such responsibilities are not common for a person as young as he is, but that the tribal leaders admired his devotion to the ways of the ancestors and his skill in harmonizing and mediating conflict within the tribe. Shortly before our interview, Tinze was honored to receive a secondhand typewriter for use in his official duties.</p>\n\n<h2>Presentation of Myths</h2>\n\n<p>The Kariri Xuco' believe that each river contains several \"Maes do Rio\" or \"mothers of the river.\" These spirits live in the river and must be respected because of their power. Dedzu's is one of these spirits and resides in a portion of the Rio San Francisco -the San Francisco River- which originates in the state of Minais Gerais, eventually flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Kariri Xuco' fishermen try to win favor from Dedzu's because if she likes them, they will always bring home fish, and their catch will surpass that of others who have not won her affections. Indeed, some fishermen give Dedzu's so many presents - delicious foods, beautiful flowers, perfumed herbs - that their wives become jealous and see Dedzu's as a rival. But if a fisherman does not abide by Dedzu's wishes, he will catch fewer fish. And if he ignores or insults her, he is at risk for having his soul stolen. Dedzu's domain is filled with stolen souls who work as slaves to do her bidding, including going on expeditions to steal other souls. The loss of one's soul is a terrible tragedy, far worse than losing one's life.</p>\n\n<p>Dedzu's is a spirit of the night. At midnight, she comes out of the water and visits the riverbank, where she eats the corn and beans left for her as well as putting the gifts of flowers in her hair and the perfumed herbs on her body. When surprised by a human being, she jumps back into the river and the intruder might hear a splash of water.</p>\n\n<p>Dedzu's powers are activated by the disappearance of the sun's rays. On occasion she will allow herself to be seen by one of the fishermen she favors. Her body is beautiful but translucent; she is human in form but has gills on her neck. She wears no clothes but her long hair flows over her body. These fishermen can stroke her body and engage in intimate conversation with her, but like other Kariri Xuco' spirits, she does not engage in sexual activity with humans. She is capable of having children, however, her pregnancy sometimes being evoked by the intimacy she shares with one of the fishermen. She can become very jealous of other \"Maes do Rio\" and envious of the wives and girlfriends of her favored fishermen.</p>\n\n<p>When Tinze was in his early 20s, he was accustomed to returning home with a fine catch of fish, frequently bringing back more than the other fishermen. Still, he followed the advice of his mother, who told him, \"When you are fishing, be careful to avoid the river spirits. Take care not to fish too much in one place or the River Mother may entrap you.\" Tinze's mother suspected something of which he was unaware: the River Mother was preparing him for an intimate relationship.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Tinze began to have girlfriends and the Water Mother grew jealous. For the first time, Tinze returned to the village at the end of the day without any fish. He tired easily and spent much of his time sleeping. His friends thought that he was ill, but his mother suspected that the River Mother was trying to steal his soul. Indeed, this suspicion was confirmed in the dreams that Tinze's mother had at night about the River Mother, who accused her of being overly protective of Tinze. One way in which Tinze's mother protected him was to put a small piece of tobacco over the door of the house and also in his shorts, because this sacred plant has the power to neutralize malevolent activities of the water spirits, and of other invisible forces as well. Tobacco represents the benevolent spirits who can protect human beings from invisible forces that are negative, especially those that result in soul loss. Tinze's mother was successful and her son recovered from his weakened condition.</p>\n\n<p>Another group of water spirits are the \"Pretus do Rio,\" or the \"Dark Ones of the River.\" One of the most powerful is Irotzu, another spirit of the night. Often, he stands at the river bank observing the fishermen. When a fisherman least expects it, Irotzu dives into the water; a splash is heard but nothing is seen. Yet the fishermen know that Irotzu is nearby and monitors their work carefully. They know that Irotzu will punish them if they fish during the time when fish eggs are hatching. They know that they must fish only when necessary, and must use only natural methods of fishing. For example, some men toss small bombs into the river and collect the fish that float to the surface. They are subject to the wrath of Irotzu, and if they try to protect themselves with tobacco, Irotzu will go after one of their immediate family members.</p>\n\n<p>Women of the Kariri Xuco' tribe can fish as well as men. One of Tinze's cousins had been fishing for a long time with no success. Finally, in frustration, she called out to the river spirits, \"Stop joking and give me some fish.\" Such a statement was disrespectful, of course. She immediately felt dizzy and almost fell out of the boat. Her sister caught her and rowed back to shore. Eventually, the transgressing woman regained consciousness, but her eyes burned badly. Her brother told her that her head looked as if it had been hit by a bow.\"</p>\n\n<p>A healing session was initiated, which successfully aided the woman's recovery. The Healing God's full name is sacred and can never be mentioned in public. However, there are many healing spirits to whom prayers can be offered directly.</p>\n\n<p>The religion of the Kariri Xuco' is syncretic. Since the time of the missionaries, members of the tribe have entered into relationships with Christian Saints through their prayers and public rituals. As Tinze remarked, \"We love Jesus Christ and admire Mother Mary, but we retain our ancestors' religion as well.\"</p>\n\n<p>A third water spirit is \"Cabe a Grande\" or \"Big Head,\" a name applied collectively to a group of invisible children who play in the river. These spirits have heads that are disproportionate in size to the rest of their bodies. Their antics can be observed when there is a rush of white water, a sudden eddy, or an unexpected phenomenon. Tinze told us, \"One day I saw a stream of water flowing against the current and knew that Big Head was being playful.\"</p>\n\n<p>These spirit children do not interfere with human affairs. However, fishermen must be aware of their behavior or their boats might get caught in the rapids that develop when Big Head is making sport.</p>\n\n<h2>Placing of Myths Within Our Perspective</h2>\n\n<p>The narratives provided by Tinze illustrate our descriptive model of myths. On an overt level, these stories are imaginative narratives that address such important human issues as family relationships, food supply, and matters of health and safety. The narratives impact behavior, giving instructions as to how fishing must be done, how the spirits must be pacified, how souls must be protected, and how sickness must be treated.</p>\n\n<p>On a covert level, these myths can be said to \"attract\" beliefs (tobacco will protect someone from malevolent spirit activity), emotions (parental concern for the souls of their children), images (the description of the Water Mother with her gifts and long hair), motivation (bringing home a fine catch of fish is so important that one is motivated to respect the water spirits), and values (the loss of one's soul is the ultimate disaster).</p>\n\n<p>The utility of our descriptive model can be demonstrated with the myths of the Kariri Xuco'. But it can also identify mythic elements in other imaginal narratives. Fairy tales are told for entertainment, but often include moral lessons. Legends tell of semi-historical feats of heroism but frequently refer to a culture's values. Sagas are compilations of legendary accounts but the motives of their characters are frequently clear.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, imaginal narratives that deal with superficial issues and do not contain behavioral implications lack the qualities that would qualify them as myths. In a world where chaos seems to be on the increase, the underlying attractor provided by myths can provide a sense of order to individuals as well as institutions, families as well as societies, and perhaps even to cultural revivals as we observed in Tinze' s accounts of the Kariri Xuco'.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Nonetheless, I treasure my dream state and trust that it mindfully influences my waking life in a positive, albeit mysterious manner. I always try to be patient, note patterns and incubate for understanding.</p>\n\n<p>For the past year, I have been plagued by anxiety dreams with a recurring theme: futilely attempting to pack a suitcase amid chaos. Too many things, so little time and space. A cast of thousands. I awaken exhausted. Now, on the surface, the meaning of these dreams is far from mysterious. In less than a year, I am anticipating a move. The very idea is stressful to me: uprooting from a neighborhood I love; harboring misgivings about whether or not I am making the right decision; all the red tape and masking tape. Change is hard. I get it! I get it! Is this unrelenting barrage on the part of my unconscious really necessary? But, of course, there is way more to the message than meets the closed eye! In waking life, I have become obsessed with the negative changes happening to San Francisco: <em>Manhattanization</em> at an exponential rate; more and more tall buildings going up; overcrowding of parks and busses; excessive, unceasing noise pollution; newcomers with, not flowers in their hair, but cellphones in their ear; rampant greed displacing long time residents of moderate means. My anger and bitterness and utter heartbreak were eating me alive. I knew that I had to either make peace with the changes or leave my beloved city. Then I dreamt...</p>\n\n<h3>KISSING THE BEAR (April 3, 2014)</h3>\n\n<p><em>I am walking around San Francisco. It is so changed that I cannot easily find my way. Van Ness Avenue (Route 101) has turned into a one lane, serpentine roadway with electric trolleys. I just miss one (trolley), and realize that if I don\u2019t start running, I will be very late to my destination.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I make my way through narrow alleys with older architecture reminiscent of European cities, but then emerge into a totally modern/futuristic area with shiny, wide and colorful square buildings that are for the most part only 4 or 5 stories high; one is constructed of mirrored glass with black and red stripes. There are few skyscrapers and many spacious, clean plazas and no automobiles or mobs of people. As I continue to run furiously, I get the idea of being in two places at once, so I visualize myself in the place I am supposed to be right now: helping my friends to sort things out and pack. The room is gigantic and full of people folding and trying on clothing. It reminds me of a bargain basement sale. I see myself there calmly mixing and mingling and lending a hand.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Suddenly a gigantic brown bear\u2014the size of a dinosaur-- plops itself down in the middle of the plaza. Everyone starts screaming and scattering, except one woman. It is L. from my neighborhood. I stop running and watch with awe as she floats up to the bear\u2019s monstrous head and kisses it gently on the lips.</em></p>\n\n<p>When I awake, I know that this is a special dream, the one I have been waiting for. Immediately, I write it down and start composing this piece for <em>Dream Network Journal</em>. I feel energized rather than anxious, which had been the case for months now when it was time to get up and face \u2018reality.\u2019 My chronic block against thoughtfully examining my dreams lifted and ideas and associations began flowing. </p>\n\n<p>The most dramatic image in my block-buster dream, without a doubt, is the larger-than-life bear. Official emblem for the California Republic, and incidentally enough, also for the Italian region of Abruzzi, where my grandmother was born. The woman \u2018L.\u2019 who fearlessly approaches the beast, lives in my neighborhood in \u2018real\u2019 life. Polk Gulch is one of the areas in San Francisco that is in the process of drastic transformation. On three sides of the older, rent-controlled apartment house where she has resided for many years, the buildings are being torn down and replaced by high-rise, high cost condominiums. </p>\n\n<p>After months of expressing justifiable rage and helplessness at the relentless noise and dust and encroaching darkness, she took the bull by the horns\u2014or should we say, the bear by the jaws\u2014and boldly initiated a transformation of her own by embracing the change and the changers. The owner and other tenants of L\u2019s building rallied around her to mediate certain conditions; for instance, the landscaped inner courtyard with Bocce Ball courts and barbeque grills that is part of the new complex will be accessible to them, also. And she convinced the foreman of the construction crew to prune the sprawling avocado tree in their backyard for no charge, saving the landlord a great deal of money or the possibility of having to destroy it. The last time I ran into L. she was beaming and insisted on giving me a tour of the construction sites, focusing on the positive aspects: \u201CSee how much wider the side walk is now?\u201D and \u201CNo more \u2018used condom alley\u2019 out my side window.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>So, it\u2019s no wonder that L. showed up in the dream in the role that she did. And what of the dreamer\u2019s role? I am directed toward helping my friends \u2018sort things out and pack.\u2019 Here we go again with that recurring theme, except this time, the atmosphere is calm rather than chaotic\u2014 once I encounter the Embracer of Change kissing the Bear. </p>\n\n<p>The day before I had the dream, I met with an old, dear friend, who also feels negatively impacted by the onslaught of changes going on around her. Instead of giving one another support, we ended up arguing and pitting our anger and fear against each other. I was particularly distraught because M. in her youth was a great source of strength and inspiration for me, by the very virtue of her ability to adapt to new situations as she navigated around becoming a slave to the Status Quo. </p>\n\n<p>The dream made it clear that I need to \u2018bear\u2019 the transforming cityscape in a more constructive manner in order to help M. and other friends who are feeling even more vulnerable and scared than I am\u2014especially those with less financial resources and options (which the dream alluded to via the suggestion of a bargain basement). Unlike the other characters that are rummaging through clothes and preparing to leave, the dreamer has a choice of being in two places at once: in the plaza with the Bear and in the basement with her friends; in addition, she exists both in the dreaming and waking realm. </p>\n\n<p>Curiously enough, although it is my dream-self that is running through San Francisco\u2019s distant future\u2014one that has evolved beyond the seemingly short-sighted, unenlightened changes that are happening right now, it is not until my waking-self recalls the dream that I realize how the City presented in the dream is actually in tune with my idealistic hopes and visions: No cars. Narrow, meandering roadways offering environmentalysound public transportation. Few sky-blocking buildings. Lots of light, greenery and open space. Older architecture preserved (or rebuilt?) to honor the past. Ah, yes, I could embrace changes like that! So why does my dream-self not take notice of the details of her gloriously redesigned (though barely recognizable) homeland? Could it be to remind me that I must not get too attached to any particular change\u2014good or bad\u2014 because, it too, will change? </p>\n\n<p>And why does the theme of change manifest in the form of an animal? Perhaps to convey the concept that change is part of the natural order of things. Which is not to say that we, as humans, should not question change or completely capitulate to it. </p>\n\n<p>We <em>do</em> have the power to positively influence the undesirable transformations by kissing the bear, so to speak, rather than fleeing from it or wildly charging it with spears. The dreamer is inspired by L.\u2019s amazing way of interacting with the Bear and stops running. She has reached her destination: a state of mind in which she can be in harmony with this powerful representative of change as well as with those it is most affecting, including herself. The Bear is no longer <em>in the way</em>, but <em>is</em> the way. </p>\n\n<p>In her position above ground, the dreamer is indicative of the outer circumstances I need to <em>adjust</em> to; her simultaneous presence in the basement, often a symbol for the unconscious, points to the <em>inner</em> workings I need to <em>adjust</em>\u2014 namely, my attitude and perspective. So then, I am at once the changer and the object of change; I am invited to take an active part in harnessing the unstoppable forces that are altering my world. I can evolve beyond the mentality of <em>victim</em> and <em>perpetrator</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The sorting and packing scenario speaks to a more obvious and minor concern (Ursula Major and Minor!): changing my address. In the larger scheme of things, this is not a big deal\u2014especially since I will still be residing in San Francisco. Nonetheless, the prospect has been the cause of enough anxiety to get the attention of my unconscious; thus, the series of dreams about preparing to relocate\u2014whose multiple meanings/messages I am just beginning to cultivate. For example, another association that I am exploring is Bear as spirit guide \u2026 considering that the creature appeared in the dream by dropping out of the sky. And do I ever need the steadfast presence of a Higher Power to encourage me to remain strong and mindfully detached in the trials ahead! The changes to San Francisco are happening over night, but my ability to better deal with them will be an ongoing challenge. Bear is not only a bastion of strength, but knows when to lie low, disengage from the battles of life for awhile; hibernate and then emerge a bit more vulnerable, grateful and eager to seek out the miracles of a renewed landscape.</p>\n\n<p>As winter turns to spring, one change depends upon and precipitates another. The transformed San Francisco that so pleased the awakened dreamer could not have come into being without the nightmarish transition that is currently taking place. Learning to embrace the smaller transitions can help us to prepare for greater ones; the time may indeed come when I need to let go of San Francisco and move on\u2014if not during the course of my life, then most certainly at the end of it. For, there is no escaping the greatest transition and transformation of all. I\u2019m sure that even the passage from this life to the next\u2014the most inevitable and all encompassing of changes\u2014can be negotiated with a fearless, open-heart if we pay attention to and honor our dreams. Easier said than done, but I feel blessed to be taking the first small steps with Bear at my side. \u221E</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

During this time I also became known in the area for the historic murals I painted with private and public commissions, and for my work as President of the Berthoud Arts and Humanities Alliance, lending my support to other Colorado artists.</p>\n\n<p>Preferring a new direction from commercial expression, I have recently begun to devote my talents to subjects with personal meaning, and my artistic work now reflects a passion for inner examination. Dream images have captivated my imagination and provide an unending source of inspiration for my paintings. It is my desire to express the mystery of the psyche\u2019s inner world and the power of dreams to impact and change our lives.</p>\n\n<p>In the year 2000, I was invited to be the attending artist to the International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and in 2001 my work was included in the art exhibit, \u201CDream Odysseys,\u201D at the Porter Gallery, UC Santa Cruz, and featured in a presentation at the annual ASD conference. In 2007 my painting \u201CFall Into Fear\u201D was awarded a Nancy Richter Briezki Dream Art Award, at the IASD\u2019s conference at Sonoma University, CA. My articles and artwork are regularly published in Dream Network, and DreamTime magazines.</p>\n\n<p>I am certified for professional dream work through the Marin Institute of CA.</p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zmytoz> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>Houses play a major role in shaping our world view. From our earliest memories, houses reflect what our world is and who shares it with us. Housing provides shelter and protection from our environment, safety, physical comfort - a refuge - a place to go within and just be/do and take care of one's needs. It is a space that is special and highly personal and its presence is a dominant and integral image in our daily lives. </p>\n\n<p>The popular story of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> that told about Dorothy's magical journey into her unconscious is an example of the rote that houses have in regard to how our worldviews are perceived. Dorothy 'dreamed' she was being carried through the sky on winds from a Kansas tornado and was awakened abruptly on the edge of the Land of Oz when her house was propelled to earth and dropped with a thud on a wicked witch - and killing her. Dorothy's journey to Oz and all she encountered along the way was all about getting home again - back to her beloved family and familiar surroundings. </p>\n\n<p>Many dream reports I receive have to do with the houses that populate our dreams and what to do with the images. feelings and people related to them. The following is a dream submitted by a woman who inherited her parents' home after their death: </p>\n\n<p><em>\"I just realized that a VERY recurring theme in my (usually disturbing) dreams is that ....</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I'm in someone else's house. Most of the time, the houses are cluttered or in disarray.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I know that houses reflect my body - but that I'm \"living in someone else's body\" doesn't click with me. Any other ideas?\"</em> ~A.M. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, one's \"dream house\" can be one's body if universally interpreted, but beneath that are also personal associations and many other layers of possible meanings. Consider that you are LITERALLY living in someone else's house (your parents') and your recurring dream theme may be pointing out that your innermost being is stiLL dealing with the \"clutter or disarray\" of memories, feelings and circumstances surrounding your parents. The 'nudging' to go through the houses in your dreams may indicate your psyche's prompting to claim its own identity; in order to have that happen, you may have a desire to have your OWN HOUSE - one that outpictures YOU and not someone's else's tastes, configurations, etc. Also, the house is considered to be the \"cosmic center\" in religious rites of various cultures, e.g., tepees. huts, Lodges, which may have spiritual significance for you, too, in terms of sacred ancestral connections. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the fact that your dream houses are cluttered, messed up, may mean that you literally have been trying to conform and \"live in\" someone else's \"stuff'. You may sense on many levels a desire to move, clean out and clear out - and you are asking the \"dream question\" because you already are aware that this would be a healing step for you. Another aspect to consider is that esoterically we have more than one body: astral. causaL physical. etheric. mental spiritual. Make conscious contact with any or aU of these other \"selves\" and see how they \"fit\" you; perhaps THEY need some attainment, clearing out or adjustment? </p>\n\n<p>Dorothy's dream search was for her home, but for you, it may be to FIND your true home. It would be important for you to ask yourself such questions as, \"What does a house mean to me?\"... What are the meanings I attribute to home?'' \"What disturbs me about my home?\" \"What pleases me about it?\" \"If I could create my perfect house, what would it look like - what would I add - what would I leave out?\" \"Who would I invite to my home?\" \"What nourishes me in my home?\" By writing out your answers, you may find further clues as to what your dream houses mean for you-and even some surprising answers. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>Dream Times</em></strong> is a column for you, its readers. It is a forum provided to give response and discussion to dream phenomena you are experiencing. </p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

One-word symbol meanings can be helpful and fun to use, but there is also danger of taking dream dictionary meanings as absolute. Dream symbol meanings often vary depending on particular situations, and vary greatly from person to person, which is why understanding your own personal meanings for dream symbols is so important to interpreting your own dreams. </p>\n\n<p>An important key in understanding your own dream symbolism and your personal meanings in dreams are what we call \u201Csymbol phrases\u201D \u2014 learning the meanings of your symbols by examining the context beyond simple one-word objects. To understand the importance of symbol phrases just consider how often we use context in our waking life. Even a simple \u201CHello\u201D can carry infinite meanings based on the event that precipitates this one-word greeting, the listener\u2019s thoughts and attitudes about the person speaking, and so on. The same is just as true for dreams. </p>\n\n<p>We will tell you more about symbol phrases later, but first a quick background of how we became co-researchers and how Evelyn became so deeply steeped in dreamwork that it led her to the six step Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID\u2122) (1) that she teaches and we research today. </p>\n\n<p>A dream about a \u201Cquiet Black man with an unshaven beard\u201D led Evelyn to inquire of Bruce Bynum\u2019s interest in helping research the PMID\u2122 dream interpretation method. Dr. Bynum said yes. We now conduct ongoing projects with students; so you see our research is not limited to the experimental lab. Dreams accommodate to essentially any theory (2) and the PMID \u2122 dream interpretation method accommodates to essentially any type learning \u2013 especially self-facilitation. </p>\n\n<p>Evelyn\u2019s dream about a \u201Cmany colored \u2018dream\u2019 cloth\u201D over her shoulders (prompted by her husband\u2019s question \u201CWonder if Ev\u2019s dreams could be helpful to her\u201D), gave her confidence to begin intense work with her dreams. In the process, Evelyn developed the PMID\u2122 dream interpretation method. Although she was a highly rated accounting professor at the time, she followed her heart (and her dreams) into earning a counselor education masters degree to support her credibility for teaching dreamwork. Today teaching others how to interpret their own dreams is the \u201C loveliest and most fulfilling work I have done.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>Now back to explaining what symbol phrases are and how they greatly accelerate your understanding of your dream symbols.</p>\n\n<h2>Awakening Personal Meanings with Symbol Phrases</h2>\n\n<p>We have found the dreamer\u2019s ability to bridge the gap from defining one-word symbols to defining the phrase that contains the symbol is very often a major key to capturing the \u201Cunique-to- theindividual meanings.\u201D An example of a one-word symbol is door. One universal meaning of the word, door, is \u201Copportunity.\u201D An example of a symbol phrase is \u201CI lock the car doors,\u201D which one dreamer understood to mean, \u201CI think I have to protect myself from danger without my husband with me \u2018on the road of life.\u2019\u201D Another dreamer understood \u201CI closed the door\u201D to mean he had overcome a difficult relationship issue that was represented in his dream. </p>\n\n<p>The phrase that contains the symbol helps the dreamer connect definitions to the context of the dream, the context being pre- dream events, pre-dream thoughts and experiences with people, places and objects. Selecting key symbol phrases is a judgment evaluation by the dreamer as to which dream phrases are the most personally meaningful. Dreamers\u2019 spontaneous feelings are the best gages for knowing the relative accuracy of meanings she or he has developed. </p>\n\n<p>Next are examples of symbol phrases that dreamers selected from their dreams. For purposes of these examples, we added words to the definitions to show dreamers\u2019 connections to the context of their dreams. </p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div>\n\n<p>\u201CDecide to be friendly with person:\u201D Way to overcome trace of stressful emotions about the person in this dream is to think friendly thoughts about her.

Last night I thought about the friendship but decided not to talk remorsefully about it. </p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div> \n\n<p>\u201CLack of food:\u201D Lack of food seemed to me to be saying I\u2019m not getting enough emotional nourishment. All there was, was booze. I\u2019m wondering where\u2019s the meat (the substance). This ties to my last night\u2019s worry thoughts about Victor\u2019s alcohol consumption. </p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/\">YourGuidingDreams.com</a> offers our <a href=\"http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/public/dreamscan.htm\">DreamScan\u2122</a> (latest technology to instantly finding meanings to one-word symbols), for use as \u201Cthought-starters.\u2019 DreamScan\u2122, free to visitors on the site, is fun to use, and many of those meanings reflect the context of the dream.. HOWEVER, the best way to find \u201Cunique-to-the-individual\u201D meanings is to go beyond one-word symbols to defining symbol phrases. YourGuidingDreams.com gives instructions to members for defining symbol phrases. The Dreamwork Systems Perspective PMID\u2122 step 6 uses a dreamwork systems approach to understanding dreams about relationships. A dreamwork systems approach is mindful of family systemic models, except, instead of the family or other major relationships coming together in personal counseling sessions, an individual studies series of dreams about various major relationships, primarily the family. (See the PMID\u2122 steps in the box).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zphras-1.jpg\" alt=\"YourGuidingDreams.com\" width=\"500\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Personalized Method for Interpretation Dreams (PMID\u2122) Steps</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your dream contents to current events and circumstances (most often, same day) to determine the context or theme of your dream. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your pre-dream thoughts (most often, same day) to your dream contents by treating the dream as a responsive answer to your pre-dream thoughts. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Develop your personal experienced-based definitions of dream symbol/symbol phrase meanings (or associations about) each dream character, place, object or circumstance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Explore the emotions you felt during your dream. Compare to your waking emotions. Also, periodically compare to previous dreams for changes in emotions over time about a relationship or issue being studied. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Explore dream for possible suggestions of how to change thoughts, attitudes or behavior leading to understanding and reduction of key issues. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Who is the primary relationship in this dream? Comment on your dreaming reactions to/ relationship with any person(s) in this dream. Also, comment on whether this dream reflects current effects from past or recent experiences with another or others. If so, compare how you related/reacted in the past with your current reactions in similar circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate the dreamwork systems perspective, we present a synopsis of Katharine\u2019s series of dreams. After each of the first four dreams and interpretations, Evelyn gave feedback (through the instructor-facilitated university course) on Katharine\u2019s PMID method use. Katharine interpreted her remaining dreams without facilitation. </p>\n\n<p>To set the background for the primary relationship issues Katharine faced, we take a couple sentences from Katharine\u2019s first dreamwork. \u201CI have recurrent emotions of guilt and responsibility. I often feel like I need to keep everyone happy and not cause conflict, and that I must take on other people\u2019s views on certain things.\u201D Then, well into her work with dreams, Katharine wrote, \u201CA common thread (in my dreams) seems to be that I am not responsible for other people\u2019s feelings and I cannot carry that burden of feeling like I need to make people feel a certain way.\u201D Dream series follows: </p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div>\n\n<h3>Dream One: \u201CFamily Crash.\u201D</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Katharine is driving, the whole family is in the car, she loses control and the car crashes. The night before the dream, Katherine felt guilty for letting her family down because she could not go with them to a football game.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div>\n\n<h3>Dream Two: \u201CVictorian Mansion.\u201D</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\u201CVictorian vs. present day,\u201D could symbolize being out of place\u2026 me caretaking my mom\u2026 which is out of place.\u201D On one floor are children who \u201Cdied at about age four.\u201D \u201CI can remember at a very young age, about four, being left at daycare, and being so upset that my mom was leaving, and wanting to cry, but not letting myself, because I knew that would make it hard for her to leave.\u201D The night before this dream, Katharine worried about her mom\u2019s \u201Ctoo quiet\u201D attitude.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div> \n\n<h3>Dream Three: \u201CBlocked Path.\u201D</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Katharine is the only family member brave enough to leave the house to make a delivery to a neighbor..

In the dream, <em>Katharine invites Paige to \u201Cpaint in the basement.\u201D Paige resists. \u201CMe eventually going back upstairs:\u201D \u201CRepresents me (Katharine) realizing I can\u2019t force Paige to look deeper into herself\u2026.\u201D</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u221E \u2248 \u2248 \u2248<span></span></div>\n\n<h3>Dream Seven: \u201CNobody Believes Me\u201D</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(a dream she had before the course, but was \u201Ctoo freaked out\u201D to work with it, came again during the course). <em>Katharine first watches a sister bury a dead person in the back yard. Finally, Katharine comes out from \u201C Hiding behind a bush: My own fear of not knowing how to confront my sister\u201D and \u201CStands next to my sister: This represents me confronting my sister, but also supporting her with this problem.\u201D Before the dream, Katharine asked her parents to talk with this daughter about a disorder that seemed quite plain to Katharine. \u201CThey didn\u2019t believe me.\u201D</em> (They don\u2019t believe her in the dream either.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>(Dreamer\u2019s Summary):</strong> \u201CCommon with other dreams is the focus on me expressing myself more even if it is scary because I am not used to it.

This message is very clear to me that I have the power to change things that I don\u2019t like, even if I may not necessarily change how others respond. I can change my own actions, which does affect the system.\u201D </p>\n\n<p>A major aim for the PMID\u2122 method is to help people in the current generation make healthful differences in their own lives, thus terminating potential unhealthful patterns. For several years, coauthor E. Bruce Bynum has suggested a \u201Cpersonalized\u201D view of an extended familial system. In his explorations of dreams with individuals and with families in therapy, he has found people in close association, such as the family, resonate with each other in such a way that dreams of each family member express the family\u2019s emotional situations. This shared matrix that exists within and between us, interlaces us all in an enfolding field, in a Family Unconscious. Though dreams of each family member reflect the family constellation, individual\u2019s dreams differ, depending on the individual\u2019s particular skew or perception of the family constellation and conflicts (4, 5). </p>\n\n<p>Though we concentrate on relationship dreams, the PMID\u2122 Method is equally useful for \u201Ceveryday\u201D guidance in common activities, such as home, work, recreation, career, education, and health. Simply eliminate PMID\u2122 Step 6. Examples of what we call everyday dreams are the <a href=\"../bcpov6zprofe\">two dreams published by Dream Network</a> (6).</p>\n\n<h2>How to Become Involved in Understanding Your Dreams with the PMID\u2122 Method</h2>\n\n<p>Would you like to use the Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID\u2122) as you record your dreams in your personal dream journal?

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6kmyth1> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p>The word \"myth\" has been tainted by common usage in which it has come to refer to a falsehood. This is unfortunate for each of us as individuals and for society in general. Rather than being judged as \"true\" or \"false,\" mythology can be best thought of as a way of making sense of reality - an interpretive tool. As such, a myth can be judged only insofar as it is functional or dysfunctional for positive growth and development at a particular point in time for a given individual, family, or group. </p>\n\n<p>Just as each culture organizes reality according to its mythology, each individual also views his or her life through a unique mythological lens. As we move through life, we are called upon to update our basic mythological understanding of the world. Accepting that our conceptions of reality are mythical in nature makes it easier for us to revise and reformulate old ways of thinking rather than to feel pressured to defend outdated views. Our personal mythologies, therefore, are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>\n\n<p>We can think of our personal mythology as including all the interacting and sometimes conflicting thoughts and feelings we consciously and unconsciously have about our world. These thoughts and feelings shape our comprehension of what the world is and of our place in it, and they help determine the actions we will take as we live our lives. Although our myths do not always engage our conscious mind, they are always intimately affecting our lives. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it. Because dreams appear to synthesize one's existing mythic structures with the data of one's life experiences, any incongruity between these elements is often presented to us in dream content. It appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, personal myths appear to form in a manner that is parallel to the way dreams develop. We can hypothesize that personal myths and dreams are both related to the brain's propensity for language and narrative structure. Humans have often been described as \"meaning-seeking animals.\" Our personal myths may be a way for us to find meaningful structure in our experience, while dreams perform the same function with the torrent of images and feelings welling up from the unconscious every night. As Montague Ullman has written, \"Our dreams serve as corrective lenses which, if we learn to use them properly, enable us to see ourselves and the world about us with less distortion and with greater accuracy.\" The same can be said of our personal mythology. </p>\n\n<p>Since our personal mythology has its roots in the ways we learned to make sense of our world during childhood, there is frequently a conflict in one's personal mythology which is affecting one's feelings, thoughts or behavior. A mythic crisis is apparent in regard to personal development. This crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. When this occurs, the psyche is in conflict as each competing myth becomes a psychological entity attempting to dominate particular situations with its particular modes of perceiving and responding. </p>\n\n<p>While personal myths shape our awareness, they themselves operate largely outside of ordinary consciousness. It is possible, however, to willfully bring many aspects of our personal mythology into our awareness. Because it is the nature of dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of behavior dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness. Awakening to the mythic dimension of our lives is to achieve the freedom to inspect and revise that wh ich for most people controls them unaware. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6kmyth1-0.jpg\" alt=\"Family sleeping in bed\" width=\"500\" height=\"auto\"/></p>\n\n<div class=\"caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Christopher Ryan relaxing on his veranda in Spain.</i></div>\n\n<p>We can develop a categorization system which describes several aspects of dreams in this ongoing dialectic. A particular dream may include one or more of the aspects outlined below. For people who have learned to understand inner events in terms of personal mythology, this can be a useful framework for understanding their dreams. </p>\n\n<p>\u2022 The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\"> \n\n<li>emphasizing past experiences which provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li>\n\n<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth</li>\n\n<li>providing visions of a future dominated by the old myth - a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>\u2022 Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\"> \n\n<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>\n\n<li>interpreting new experiences in this manner and/or accommodating the old myth to fit new experiences in a manner that corresponds more closely to the counter-myth;</li>\n\n<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities; while inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>\u2022 The dream may facilitate a cognitive integration between the two myths. As ongoing experiences bring the two toward a compromise, they become more compatible, an integration of essential elements of each becomes possible, and the cognitive forces that work against conflict begin to integrate the two myths. This process is suggested in dreams which:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\"> \n\n<li>highlight experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li>\n\n<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experiences and show ways of resolving it;</li>\n\n<li>portent a future where the conflict is resolved, often instructing us in how to accomplish the resolution.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Feeling tone often gives a clue as to the function of the dream. \"Old myth\" dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining in terms of energy and vitality. \"Counter-myth\" dreams typically tend to feel hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating. \"Integration\" dreams tend to produce a calm positive, realistic feeling. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, dreams can play an important role in presenting the personal mythic structure to the dreamer. Dreams can itemize each aspect of our personal mythology and can point out when an old personal myth has become inadequate for life's current issues. The dream can point out when personal myths have become outdated, can provide a dialectical encounter between old and new myths, and can mediate conflicts between myths even providing new mythic structures and facilitating synthesis. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>For further exploration of the concepts and techniques presented in this article, please see The Mythic Path by D.

<https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#bcpov6zfflyi> <https://www.dannykennedy.co/dnj-ontology#description> "<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfflyi-0.jpg\" alt=\"Airobics\" /></p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon of flying in one's sleep is truly a miracle. If, as they say, ontogeny recapitulates philogeny, then consider the premise that we are all, at some time in our primal development. equipped with tail, gills and wings and all other aspects of an the creatures that live in air and water, especially fish and birds. The fact that dreamers can fly and breathe underwater as well as free fly in their sleep without any previous instruction or practice may be related to this innate, though undeveloped, potential.</p>\n\n<p>For some years I have been collecting flying dreams. Everywhere I go I ask people how they fly. I want to include in this book a few of the interesting reports I've received, both to encourage dream flyers to share their adventures and to inspire others, especially those timid dreamers who have never experienced free flying, to try to relax and develop your will to fly.</p>\n\n<p>The styles of flying are far more numerous than I ever imagined. They include flapping, soaring, sitting, lying, swimming, flopping, breast and butterfly stroking, dolphin kicking, whale tail snapping, and the yoga sit style of flying. </p>\n\n<p>Then we have ASSIST FLYING: people empowered to fly holding a stick, a magic wand, or by riding a refrigerator, bed soaring, carpet flying, floor grabbing, back packing, and, most original, something called bloodpressure cuff pump flying. There is low and high altitude flying. Some can fly only a few inches off the ground. Some can do barn storming. A young woman says she flies, but never above the telephone wires. My son claims he's expert at indoor ceiling hovering. Some people jump to take off and fly at head height. Some fly at building height. Some are totally weightless for outer space flying. </p>\n\n<p>We have human jet travelers and cosmic trans-gravity floaters. Some run on trans-spirit supersonic propulsion. Many hover out of their bodies. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are just plain old fashioned BIRD flappers. Some have to make a great effort to stay up, while others rise off the ground at will. We even have those who fly in the body of another. </p>\n\n<p>There are stories about effortless flight and stories of flight frustration. Some people go somewhere and others go nowhere. You can fly for joy or what one man calls efficiency flying; the only way to get there faster. Some dreamers are propelled by fear, called the fight or flight style. Some Guru followers know about spiritual transcendance, and a gal from California describes orgasmic cartwheeling. </p>\n\n<p>We have stories of people who fly on air channels, people who FLY TO SEE and people who FLY TO FEEL. METHOD FLYING uses guide ropes or long stride takeoffs. Ordinary arm flapping is common, but fish tail flopping is rare. Some dreamers have to run in air or they can't stay up. One physicist uses the balling up method where he shoots through the atmosphere. A mathematician on my street does what he calls the tadpole wiggle. He says he can also sit on the back of a couch and slip out through the top of his head. Some of the experienced meditators say they do levitation rising. </p>\n\n<p>Then there is intention flying versus guided imagining. I've got stories about losing power in midflight, as well as flying faster than light. One woman from the midwest says she flew to her father racing death, and was able to say good by before he died. Some dreamers tell about floating through walls, through floors and windows. They can float down stairs, or descend head first diving, spinning, dancing, with arms backwards and arms forward. Some have no arms at all. </p>\n\n<p>Upside-down flying is more difficult, says a girl from New Hampshire, because you can't see where you are going at all. I'm waiting for more information about ecstatic flying orgasms. The girl who can bring them on at will says she has invented a dream pill and has a teachable Olympic routine of sexual acrobatics and tandem flying. </p>\n\n<p>While presenting some dream programs for the \"outer-most\" listener supported radio station in Provincetown Mass., I received more contributions to my collection of flying dreams. I am fascinated by the variety of methods, positions, problems and adventures of those lucky dreamers who have the flying skill on command.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../images/post-bcpov6zfflyi-1.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrations\" /></p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Psi dreaming has seemed natural ever since; lucid dreaming comes easily; and I especially enjoy exploring the potential of lucid psi. I love inspiring others to expand the horizons of their dream worlds and above all I treasure the incidents that reveal our ultimate connectedness.</p>\n\n<p>My careers have ranged from ranch hand to bellydancer but my degree is in biology and my current job title is Wildlife Biologist with a subtitle of Visual Information Specialist. You can see some of my work at my <a href=\"http://fatooh.org/art/\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's been my hope since my first childhood mutual dream that science would advance beyond its hesitancy to acknowledge, let alone explore, that which isn't readily replicable and measurable with current technology. Dreams seem such an accessible gateway to the science of consciousness - what could be better than an International Association for the Study thereof? I only wish I'd found it 25 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>I'm pleased to have presented papers and facilitated discussions for IASD PsiberDreaming conferences, and recently led a workshop on lucid dreaming at the Southern California regional conference.</p>\n\n<p>The IASD YouTube page features my short video based on a true story of an elder with advanced Alzheimer's communicating via a dream, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flcxkg6roQo\">The Message</a></p>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
