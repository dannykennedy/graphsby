<p>I began my artistic work in the 1980’s as a graphic designer, operating my own design firm with clients throughout the state of Colorado, where I reside. During this time I also became known in the area for the historic murals I painted with private and public commissions, and for my work as President of the Berthoud Arts and Humanities Alliance, lending my support to other Colorado artists.</p>

<p>Preferring a new direction from commercial expression, I have recently begun to devote my talents to subjects with personal meaning, and my artistic work now reflects a passion for inner examination. Dream images have captivated my imagination and provide an unending source of inspiration for my paintings. It is my desire to express the mystery of the psyche’s inner world and the power of dreams to impact and change our lives.</p>

<p>In the year 2000, I was invited to be the attending artist to the International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and in 2001 my work was included in the art exhibit, “Dream Odysseys,” at the Porter Gallery, UC Santa Cruz, and featured in a presentation at the annual ASD conference. In 2007 my painting “Fall Into Fear” was awarded a Nancy Richter Briezki Dream Art Award, at the IASD’s conference at Sonoma University, CA. My articles and artwork are regularly published in Dream Network, and DreamTime magazines.</p>

<p>I am certified for professional dream work through the Marin Institute of CA.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Do you ever wish you could have a really <em>BIG DREAM?</em> You might imagine what it would be like: a great opportunity. Some people report having life defining dreams that remain vividly in mind for years. </p>

<p>Who wouldn’t want such an experience? In ones’ imagination, the <em>big dream</em> might be extremely vibrant, or be of the utmost clarity. Most certainly, it would be memorable and life changing. The dream might spark a spiritual awakening. </p>

<p>In an attempt to find out more about the big dream, I looked through my dream book collection. Some of the authors assured readers that their books on dreams provided all the information they needed to know about dreams. Nevertheless, scanning tables of contents, chapter titles, section labels, and indices failed to turn up any direct reference to the big dream. </p>

<p>The big dream was even elusive on the internet. The term was there. Some “big dream” sites attempted to tell internet surfers what they “really” want out of life. One site had a synchronicity card pack for sale. Another site was about a church building fund. Even “bigdream.com” billed as “your source for virtually anything” wasn’t a source of information about big dreams. On a hunch, I revisited The World Dream Book by Sarvananda Bluestone. He used the term, “great dream.” He also provided a simple yet significant reminder that “ … there are many kinds of dreams, it lies with the dreamer to determine the nature of the dream and it remains for each person to determine his dreams’ lessons.” </p>

<p>There is certainly the chance that many of us have had a big dream and failed to recognize it. We’ve been conditioned in our society to expect important things to make a big impression. The big dream may fail to get our full attention at first. </p>

<p>Symbolically, the International Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) has been like a big dream for me that began quietly but grew in importance as I worked with it. It has helped me to satisfy my intention to learn more about dreams by providing reading material, group study opportunities, dream sharing groups, and research reports. Most importantly, it has provided the opportunity to be a part of a dedicated community of dreamers. Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell are vital members of that community. </p>

<p>I met Rita when I attended an Association for the Study of Dreams annual conference for the first time. Prior to the conference, I had little contact with the organization. Rita made quite a fuss over me. She explained how she had seen my name as a founding member of the association on paperwork for about 14 years and wondered who this phantom person might be. Her welcome made me feel very much at home during a personally and professionally rough time in my life. Immediately after the conference, I got to enjoy her company when a small group of members went out to supper before returning home. Remembering the event brought a heartfelt smile as I recalled such a warm feeling of belonging. Over time, I became aware of how vitally important Rita was to the association and all of the people she has welcomed. Years later, at another conference, I was just turning to leave the ball, when Rita reached out and asked me to dance. I wondered if she had sensed that I felt alone and reached out once again to make me feel right at home. </p>

<p>I met Jean Campbell at an ASD Conference in Copenhagen a few years ago. I knew about her marvelous “Dream Bridge” project that allowed children from different countries to share their dreams. I can recall with fondness, sitting on a restaurant boat with Jean and another member as Jean shared her dreams, plans, and hopes for the organization. The weather was chilly and rainy, but she projected an air of confidentiality that made me feel like a life long friend. At a subsequent conference, I was pleased to learn that she had been elected as president of the association and I worked just briefly with her on a project. More recently, I received a note card from Jean in the mail. She was complementing me on an article I had written. I was tickled to read the compliment in her beautifully written script even before I had gotten a chance to see the article in print myself. </p>

<p>Like dream characters, Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell came into my life for an admittedly brief period of time, but have had an ongoing and meaningful effect. In order to fully appreciate the positive impact these two dedicated individuals have had on the lives of others, however, we would literally have to visit with people all over the world. You can bet that Rita and Jean represent portions of the big dreams of many individuals. So, if you get a chance to meet Rita and Jean, be sure to see that opportunity as potentially life changing, something like a big dream coming your way. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>A taste of Cyberspace for those wondering what's going on with dreaming and Internet</em></p>

<p>If you haven't been online yet, your first experience might be something like walking into a surprise party. Everyone wants your attention and many will share your same interests, no matter how off-beat. I know that Al Gore talks about the "Information Super-highway" (1) and everyone gets excited about how much data is available but the real surprises online are the people. This human connection exists at several levels, from casual and committed one on one relationships, to global community connectivity and activism. As might be expected, these levels of relationship hold true for dream concerned individuals and groups as well. </p>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

<p>Originally designed as ARPA Net by the U.S. Defense Department in the late 1960's to protect political telecommunications in case of an atomic war, the net was a series of four computers that all shared &amp; exchanged the same information. By 1971 it had attracted the attention of the universities and there were 21 host computers, but no one was sure what the common language was going to be between all these computers. By 1982, the decision was made (TCP/ IP), and by 1986 there were 5,000 host computers , mostly at universities and government offices and all able to talk the same language and share the same information. By 1989, the Internet hit the public and media and there were 100,000 host computers. The last figure I heard for 1995 was that the Net had reached 5 million computers. (2)</p>

<p>To be connected to the internet, all one has to have now is a computer, a modem, some Internet software and an account with an Internet Service Provider. If you don't have a free university or government account, there are a multitude of providers and most now give you all the software you need when you sign up with them. The average cost ranges from $10 - $25 per month. The number of people using the Internet is already uncountable, but to give you a tool by which to guess the near future , I want to paraphrase Bill Clinton's October 1995 directive: "By the year 2000, all U.S. schools K-12 will be connected." (3) What will we and our children have access to when we start a computer net search for "Dreams"?</p>

<h2>Dreaming in Cyberspace</h2>

<p>To answer that question, it is important to know the distinction between the Internet and Cyberspace. The Internet is a more technical term, the way we connect with one another in computer mediated communications. Cyberspace is the place where this all happens. And there are several kinds of platforms or venues in Cyberspace that dream concerned individuals use. The most popular are E-mail, World Wide Web (WWW) and Usenet.</p>

<h2>Usenet, IRC and Chatrooms</h2>

<p>Usenet is a group of electronic discussion boards started in 1979 to discuss various university curriculum topics, but since that time Usenet has exploded into hundreds of topic from saving the rainforests to chat about the latest episode of the X-files. Like a real bulletin board, one can post messages, read other's messages and leave replies. The first dream bulletin board (alt.dreams) went up just a couple years ago and allows individuals to post dreams and dream related issues as well as making comments on the posts that go up. Some people want advice on how to recall dreams, some want their dreams interpreted, some want to start small online dreamsharing groups. The level of discussion is very uneven and the board is predominately used as a way for people new to dreaming online to ask questions and get connected with more serious projects. But I'm hoping in the near future to include on alt.dreams discussions on dream theory, dream research and the wide array of techniques used by dreamworkers. Also I see alt.dreams as an excellent venue for networking local and regional dream groups, distributing news and developing mutually supportive projects. </p>

<p>In the last year, two more dream related Usenet groups have appeared. The first is alt.dreams.lucid, a discussion board just for lucid dreaming issues, and alt.dreams.Castaneda, which discusses all of the Castaneda issues, but seems most invigorated by the variations on lucid dreaming that are being practiced. Other newsgroups such as alt.psychology.Jung and talk.religion.new age will occasionally discuss dreams in light of their own particular viewpoints. </p>

<p>A spin-off of the newsgroups are the real time internet Relay Chat channels. On the IRC channels you can enter one of hundreds of ongoing real time discussions, simply by typing in a sentence or two and sending it to a screen where others in the room are also sending sentences. Or you can create you own rooms, invite your friends or associates or wait for visitors. Complex interactions and threads can take place but generally the quality is usually lower than on Usenet. There are exceptions. These Chat rooms are also available on most commercial online servers and Fred Olsen has been doing dream reentry work on both Genie and AOL. His directed questions style works quite well in this real time mode. Another notable exception is the Dream Studio, which Donna Campos opens on Mondays nights at 6:00 PM EST on Compuserve. She invites a different guest each week to discuss a variety of dream topics. The key to these chat channels seems to be having a host or guiding moderator.</p>

<h2>The World Wide Web (WWW): Internet Gets a Friendly Face</h2>

<p>In 1990, a couple of CERN physicists in Switzerland were given the task of developing a network that could be used by a variety of international physicists. What they came up with was the World Wide Web, a system that could go out on the Net and use any resource. In 1993, Marc Andreessen gave this route a friendly face by developing for NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the Univ. of Ill. in Urbana-Champaign) a program called Mosaic browser. He gave Mosaic away to the public for free. By December of 1993, over a thousand browsers a day were being downloaded (taken from the net).</p>

<p>What these browsers do is allow net connected users to travel from one friendly page to another at the click of a mouse. These friend ly pages, or web sites (collections of pages), run about $10.00 to $30.00 a month to put up commercially and are free to many university students. What do people put on these pages? Everything! Pictures of themselves and their kids, one's life story, all the things you want to sell, and links that let you jump to other sites, your friends' sites, your business site, similar interest sites. And so, of course, we all put the dreams and dream information we want other people to know about on our web pages.</p>

<p>There are now dozens of Web sites that include information on dreams and dreaming. Dream Network Journal has as site, Electric Dreams has a site, and even ASD and the Lucidity Institute Inc., have sites. A good place to start browsing is a directory of many (not all) dream sites on Yahoo web directory. I've also made available a file called Dream Guide to the Internet which covers most of the sites and how dreaming is represented online. (4) </p>

<p>There are also several dream sharing sites now on the Web. The most interactive and sophisticated at this time is Dream Link. At Dream Link, you can not only finds lots of information about dreams, but actually participate in interactive dreams sharing. It works kind of like a specialized bulletin board. You go to the site with a Web browser and leave your dream and information about your dream. Linton and Becky Hutchison distribute your dream to their network and put both your dream and comments on the dream back up on one of their web pages. The future of the Internet is to be found in the Web. The now static pages will give way to real time video channels and more Interactive forums. But at this time, the one thing you can't get on your Web browser is electronic mail, and e-mail rules the Internet.</p>

<h2>E-mail, E-zines and Mail Lists.</h2>

<p>In early 1993 when the Web was still more of a great idea than a reality, if you wanted to connect with someone on more than a superficial level you used email. We still do. E-mail is like a regular letter except that it's cheaper and faster. I can send a ten page letter from my home in San Francisco to my friends in Australia for about 3 cents. And it gets there in minutes. (Of course, they are probably asleep and won't read and reply for several hours!) What is even better, I can make a copy of that letter and send it to everyone I have-ever met in Cyberspace with an Internet e-mail address (say about a thousand addresses) for the same 3 cents. If I did this, I would probably get 999 letters back, each costing me 3 cents, telling me to knock it off and please send only relevant, personal letters - but I think the point is clear. </p>

<p>E-mail mini-dream groups are easy to start and inexpensive to maintain. They have sprung up all over the globe. Usually with a dozen or less participants, email groups share dreams and comments about each other's dreams. They may last a week, or become a permanent group of friends. </p>

<p>In August of 1993, I found one such community that had grown to about 30 members and put out every couple of weeks a magazine, (or e-zine) Electric Dreams. Originally the community used the e-zine to distribute dreams and comments on the dreams from previous issues. But the members wanted to cut down on the 2 week time lag between dreams and comments. The solutjon was to have the dreams distributed to those interested in commenting so that dreams and comments would be printed together every week or two. </p>

<p>These dreamsharings were certainly not the same as off-line or face-to-face groups, but I felt very excited about the process and felt there was a great networking potential in sharing dreams on a global scale. I had recently been impressed with the networking style of Jill Gregory, the director of the Novato Center for Dreams. Through a variety of news bulletins, dream groups and other interpersonal projects, the dreamers in the Bay area maintain a creative personal community, while at the same time staying in contact with the international dream community. I wanted to model this regional approach on a global scale and added news, projects and other forums to the Electric Dreams community - but the core of the process, the dreamsharing, still needed some anchoring. </p>

<p>Early in 1995 I found an online model for dreamsharing. John Herbert had been running a variation of Montague Ullman style groups on the America Online (AOL) Seniornet. John had also run these groups earlier on local Bulletin Boards or BBS and compared them to face-to-face groups. (5) These BBS are local computer networks that allow people to dial up and participate in various activities, from getting software to playing games, to doing genealogical research. He would have the participants work on one dream at a time, first asking clarification questions, then making comments in the Ullman "if this were my dream..." style. At each step, the dreamer had a chance to respond if he or she wished. Now on AOL, John uses a similar bulletin board style, and participants can anonymously post dreams and comments within the mediated process. His preliminary research indicates that the online groups provide as much or more insight than face-to-face groups. Generally he attributes this to the reflective, unpressured time that dreamer and respondents have to make comments. </p>

<p>I took this process back to the Electric Dreams community, modified it for e-mail and have been trying out variations for about a year. The first were round-robins, where we had one file and a list of participants. The file was passed around with the next addresses of where to send the file. As the growing file passed through the mediator and dreamer, the next phase was enacted; from dream presentation, to clarification questions, to replies and comments. It was an administrative nightmare. We switched to a process suggested by Jay Vinton to simply have everyone maintain the group list and send each comment or reply to everyone else on the list. This has worked pretty well and if the continually positive and enthusiastic comments received from the dreamers at the end of the process continue, the two week group mail list will become a permanent fixture to the Electric Dreams community.</p>

<p>The two week Post-and-Comment style dreamsharing is still a part of Electric Dreams and recently I added a special mail list distribution and communication channel to facilitate this. Interested subscribers join the list and can not only submit dreams, but discuss the dreams as well as comments and aspects of dream interpretation in general. Bob Krumhansl pulls all the relevant dialogues, dreams and comments together and we publish them for the whole community every two or three weeks.</p>

<p>Electric Dreams continues to be a kind of eye on Internet for dreamers and a forum for direct dreamsharing, education and news. But even more it is a swarm of mutant butterflies in Cyberspace, a community experimenting with dreamsharing at its core. New forms of dreamsharing appear every week and with the addition of new technologies, even more forms will soon be available.</p>

<h2>Technological Solution or Social Revolution?</h2>

<p>Many people are wary of the Internet and the promises of its being just the latest in a series of 19th and 20th Century technological solutions that end up causing more harm than good. I agree with this caution and feel the Net will probably bring with it more problems than solutions. Just like democracy and Rock &amp; Roll. I'm afraid it is already past the point of trying to pack it up and send it back to National Science Foundation. What we can do is become involved and shape the way that onHne interaction occurs. For example, just as with off-line dreamsharing, on line dreamsharing continues the valuing of inner resourcefulness, of intuitive perception, of supporting each person in being his or her own authority in matters of meaning and value and bringing those out into the community at large.</p>

<p>I don't mean to offer online dreamsharing as better than off-line. I'd rather not set up a feeling of competition here; I personally love the physical embodiments of dream drama and the risky emotional contact and personal closeness of face-to-face meetings. This is just not available at this time on the Net. Rather, I'd like to present online dreamsharing as something new, opening a new niche, a new wavelength that is different from face-to-face dream sharing. Online dreamsharing complements and supports all other kinds of dream sharing through the more specific development of reflective skills and more general global dissemination of the benefits of communiti es tied together through the sharing of dreams. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>What? The president of an international dream association is telling us not to interpret our dreams? Banish him to the tower immediately!</em></p>

<p>Wait! Let me explain. </p>

<p>When referring to dreamwork, I have trouble with the term, “interpretation,” as it implies determination of a finite “meaning” and we all know dreams carry multiple meanings. I don’t think the purpose of dreamwork is interpretation, but many people come to dream groups expecting their dream to be “interpreted,” suggesting that there is just one explanation for the dream – and that the dream is meant just for them. </p>

<p>In an open dream group I led in Asheville, North Carolina people dropped in and shared dreams that amazed and perplexed them. Of course the next words out of their mouths were, “What does it mean?” The group would spend the next hour or so laboriously “working” each dream and the dreamer usually left with some degree of satisfaction in regard to what the dream was about. That was the conclusion of their experience. </p>

<p>Most of these people had little interest in learning how to work on their own dreams such as starting a journal or studying their dream history. They represent many who have dreams that pique their curiosity, but would prefer others to tell them what they mean. Some are even willing to pay a few dollars to an “expert” or skim through a dream dictionary to gain insight. </p>

<p>When doing dreamwork, I prefer the term, “exploration.” I see our roles as dream facilitators or group members as ones who explore a dream in an effort to help the dreamer attain self-discovery. In group settings, exploration is magnified and multiplied. When shared, one person’s dream does not belong to that person alone but takes on its own life within each member of the group.</p>

<p>I tell my groups that a dream is brand new when it occurs in sleep and is again brand new when it is told. Each person hearing it is creating a version of the dream and it is no longer one dream, but many. In other words there is a new dream being dreamed at that moment by each person in the room as well as each person in their families, co-workers or social network friends – and each one grows from the insight of the one dream captured by one person. </p>

<p>In effect, we are not interpreting a dream, but we are opening up multitudes of possibilities for the dreamers exposed to it. I don’t call my groups dream analysis or dream interpretation groups, but rather dream study groups. We study. We explore. We experience the dream. And we each benefit from that experience. </p>

<p>Every person who hears a dream becomes a facilitator; one who serves the dreamer by listening and attempting to understand the aspects of the dream without projecting or “interpreting” it for the dreamer. During the process the veils of confusion are removed and both the dreamer and the facilitator begin to appreciate the blessings the dream has to offer. </p>

<p>To avoid projection and the danger of “telling” someone what a dream means when providing personal insight, many dreamworkers begin with the phrase, “If this were my dream....” That is, if this were my dream it would have this or that meaning or this symbol would mean such and such to me. In order to totally avoid the possibility of projection I prefer, “In my version of the dream …” By saying this, I take ownership of the dream and am less likely to project based on prior knowledge I may have of the dreamer. In this respect I am more likely to deal solely with the dream itself. </p>

<p>During a dinner party in my home, a woman at the table told an incredible dream about sheep. When she was done, everyone looked at me, as if they expected me to immediately know what the dream “meant.” Knowing my in-depth involvement with dreams, they expected me to be an “expert.” I told them I didn’t have the slightest idea what that dream meant. I took solace remembering an incident Robbie Bosnak wrote about in his book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>. As I recall, after a client of his told a dream, he broke into a cold sweat acknowledging to himself that he didn’t have any idea what it meant. I felt comforted knowing that this man, who does dreamwork for a living, goes through the same anxiety I do when expected to “interpret” a dream. </p>

<p>When first told, the dream is a mystery. Its meaning is as unknown to the listener as it is to the dreamer. But as we venture into that unknown, peeling away layer after layer, examining the details, identifying the characters and action sequences of the story - exploring deeper and deeper - the messages the dream is attempting to convey become apparent. For instance, as I delve into a dream about a bear invading my camping space, I may see it as asking me to think about how I deal with conflict or potential conflict, what choices I am making (such as facing fear or running away) or simply how I deal with unexpected consequences. Perhaps all are true. Ultimately, I come to realize there is no fi nite meaning, but infi nite possibilities. </p>

<p>Instead of using the terms dream interpretation or analysis, I support exploration. By steering away from what a dream “means,” (since all dreams have multiple meanings), we can embrace what the dream is asking us to do - to face the critical issues in our lives so we can advance and grow. They ask us the questions we need to address, and rather than giving us direct answers, they guide us to the next question. If we just decide, “this dream means this or that,” we are likely to just say, “Since I know what that dream means, I don’t need to explore it any further,” and we fail to experience the full richness of the dream. </p>

<p>Analysis leads to knowledge. True wisdom comes from being in a space of “not knowing.” ℘ </p>

  <p>“Not knowing is true knowing. One knows truly only when one has the wisdom of emptiness. Wisdom is then limitless.” <em>Chan Master Sheng Yen</em> </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Transcript of an invited presentation given on the history of the dream movement, the publication Dream Network and a brief personal history at the Association for the Study of Dreams Conference, Berkeley, CA 1996.</em></p>

<p>It is truly a pleasure and a privilege to be here tonight. This is a very new experience for me, so please be patient as I get adjusted to being up here.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I'd like to thank all of the people who have encouraged me.  I'm not going to mention names, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the dreamers, writers, artists, poets, previous editors, everybody who has helped to keep the spirit that manifests as the publication Dream Network alive over the past 14 and a half years. Quite honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed a bit right now. I have “as has been true with Will” known many of you for so long and yet am just tonight meeting you in person for the first time.  Additionally, I've never done anything like this before.  This is a first time, initiatory, trial-by-fire experience, and I ask your patience and your good energy.  And if you give that to me, you may be in for a little show, because I have a tendency to speak as much with my hands and my body as I do with my voice. So c'mon, I'll provide you with some entertainment!</p>

<p>I want to begin tonight by sharing a piece that was given to me by a poet friend some years ago.  It was a piece read at a meeting of the New Latin American Poets in Mexico City some time ago. The author is unknown.  But it's a piece that I believe holds the essence of the spirit of the dream movement, and is a credo that we've adopted among those people who are networkers within the context of the Dream Network.  I then want to spend the majority of the time introducing those of you who aren't familiar with the publication and its history... to Dream Network by introducing previous editors and sharing a little bit about what we've been doing over the past 14 and a half years. I will conclude by sharing a piece that I've written about dreams and exploring the mystery.  So to begin, I will read, if I may,</p>

<h2>A Message to Poets and Dreamers</h2>

<p>"We who are poets and dreamers know that the reason for a poem is not discovered until the poem itself exists.  The reason for a living act is realized only in the act itself.  This meeting is a spontaneous explosion of hopes.  That is why it is a venture in prophetic poverty, supported and financed by no foundation, organized and publicized by no official group, but a living expression of the belief that there are now in our world new people, new poets, new dreamers, who are not in tutelage to established political systems or cultural structures, but who dare to hope in their own vision of reality and of the future...</p>

<p>"This meeting is united in a flame of hope whose temperature has not yet been taken, and whose effects have not yet been estimated, because it is a new fire.  The reason for the fire cannot be apparent to one who is not warmed by it.  The reason for being here will not be found until all have walked together, without afterthought, into contradictions and possibilities...</p>

<p>"We believe our future will be made by love and hope, not by violence or calculation.  The Spirit that has brought us together, whether in space or only in agreement, will make our encounter an epiphany of certainties we could not know in isolation...</p>

<p>"The solidarity of poets and dreamers is not planned and welded together with tactical convictions or matters of policy, since these are affairs of prejudice, cunning, and design.  Whatever our failures, the poet and dreamer is not a cunning person.   His or her art depends on an ingrained innocence which he or she would lose in business, in politics, or in too organized a form of academic life.  The hope that rests on calculation has lost its innocence.  Let us band together to protect our innocence!" (end ‘Credo’)</p>

<p>That is called again, "A Message to Poets," author unknown, but very relevant, I believe, to the challenge that stands before us as we create new ways of recognizing that so many of the ways that we've been taught are not working for us any longer.</p>

<h2>History of Dream Network/Past Editors</h2>

<p>Now I want to talk about what I know of the history of the Dream Network.  There are many details that I don't know.  I was fortunate to be able to make contact with most of the previous editors and get statements from them and I'll be sharing those.  But, in essence, I do know that the publication was started with an intention to bring dreams back to dreamers, to acknowledge the fact that we've learned that we all dream every night, and that we have a right to learn, to understand, the symbolic and metaphoric language of dreams.  It was begun in the spirit of being a grassroots publication and it's remained that way over the past 14+ years.  And it couldn't have happened without, as Will said, the dedication and effort that so many people have put into it over the years.  At this point, if we could have the house lights out, we'd like to show a few slides to show the evolution of the publication over the years.</p>

<p>Dream Network was begun in January 1982 by a very fiery and compassionate young man by the name of Bill Stimson.  And I'd like to read... That's his picture there and that's the first issue of Dream Network.  And, in that issue he published an article that he wrote called, "Armed with our Dreams." I'd like to read just the last paragraph of that article:</p>

<p>"Armed with our dreams, we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around.  The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women.  To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness."</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote Bill and asked him if he'd be willing to share a few words and he was aware that I was going to be making this presentation.</p>

<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>

<p><em>"The Dream Network is not the publication; the enterprise proper isn't a publishing one. To speak the truth of what the Dream Network is about for us is to find our myth -- where else but among our dreams? -- for us to use our dreams in a way that enables us to come together honestly and deeply, for what was broken to be rendered whole again, our community with one another, our connection with our deeper selves, our oneness in purpose, our ability and our resolve to embody the light itself. What makes the Dream Network special is that it's fundamentally different.  People sense this somehow and so they've helped the energy and unfoldment move forward."</em></p>

<p>During Bill's time (and if you'd please show the next two slides, Will)... I don't understand the dynamics that were behind this, but there were different publications coming out in different parts of the country that were called Dream Network affiliate publications.  One of them was called Fusion.  I believe it came out of Seattle.  And there was another called DreamCraft, which came out of somewhere in the northeast.  I'm not certain about that, however.  There was a big stir of energy happening at that time.  One of my advisors and a very, very good friend, who is one that I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting in the flesh, is Barbara Shore.  And she was a part of the original New York dream community.  I wrote her and asked if she'd share some of her experiences from those early days. I think this might sound familiar to a lot of you because, I know in my own experience, when I first began having these incredible dreams, I didn't have too many places to turn and there wasn't a lot of information available to help me understand what was happening.  What Barbara has to say is,</p>

<p><em>"In my mind's eye is Bill Stimson's small, walk-up flat on a hot summer's night...the beginnings of the New York dream community.  We never formed a tight-knit group because the people kept changing too often for that.  The room was usually crowded...15 to 20 people.  Essentially, we knew nothing about dreams, but Bill's enthusiasm and passion for dreams was contagious. It was a dream whose time had come, like the classic dream of finding yourself in your own home but entering a new room that you've never been in before.  We were electrified.  This group was the core of the New York dream community and the New York dream community was the core of the early dream movement in the United States.  Although we couldn't articulate it at the time, I think we realized that we now had a mission in life. We were converts to dreams.  Was it Bill's vision of a global network of dreamers we were envisioning or did it arise spontaneously among us?  I don't know, but it was powerful.  When Bill got an idea, he didn't rest until he got it out there.  He was the prototype of the populist networker, the Trotsky of the dream revolution. It might have happened without him, but it never would have been so fast, so intense, so like a prairie fire in a season of drought.  Maybe this was the next step after the revolutionary 60's.  That world-changing vision hadn't fully worked, so maybe we had to go back to the inner drawing board, and remake the world from the individual psyche's infrastructure inside out, instead of the other way around."</em></p>

<p>Bill did the Dream Network; he was at that time putting it out monthly. It was a four to eight page bulletin.  And he did that for approximately two years, at which time it came into the hands and heart of Chris Hudson.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't contact...I couldn't locate Chris, so I don't have anything to share with you directly from him.  But I did meet him in my early days of work with the Dream Network, and want to share some of that meeting with you a little later on.  For this purpose, I'll say that I did get letters from people who have been long-time readers who made a lot of comments about their appreciation of Chris's willingness to share his own process, to share his own dreams during the years that he was editor and publisher.  And they also appreciated the very lively Letters to the Editor section that he introduced into the publication.</p>

<p>Chris was in Brooklyn and Henry and Bob Van De Castle are the people who took responsibility for the publication next, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>

<p>Once again I don't know any of the dynamics that occurred when the publication was making its moves around the country. But Henry and Bob have shared that even before the Dream Network appeared on the scene, Henry had published several issues of the "Sundance Community Dream Journal," which was the precursor to the Dream Network.  It was the first published journal declaring that dreams belong to dreamers.  The Sundance Journal and Henry's early efforts have had him dubbed "The Father of the American Dream Movement" in many circles.  Henry and his wife, along with Bob Van De Castle, took responsibility for the Dream Network in 1985, and during that time, Bob conducted a very successful dream telepathy experiment through the publication.  And Henry did a real interesting study on shoes as symbols in dreams.  Articles and his findings were published throughout the time that he and Bob were doing this.  I'm a little embarrassed and self-conscious because both Henry and Robert are sitting right here in front of me.  And I know that there are probably many things that I'm not saying. Would either of you like to make comments about your time? (Henry and Robert signal ‘no.’)</p>

<p>Okay. ... During the period of time that they were co-editing the publication, Bob was also serving as the president of ASD.</p>

<p>From their hands, in approximately 1987, it traveled into the hands and heart of Linda Magellon, here in nearby San Jose. Linda, who I don't believe is here tonight, (she said she had responsibilities elsewhere), had this to say,</p>

<p><em>"Dream Network Bulletin is a communal project.  It couldn't happen without the help of family, friends, and colleagues, without the assistance of volunteer staff, contributors, and subscribers.  Under my tutelage, the most important goal was to assure that new voices would be heard, new visions seen, especially those dreamers who'd not been previously published. They were nurtured and encouraged to dare to dream in the public forum."</em></p>

<p>Linda had a great deal of support as well from Bob Trowbridge and Jill Gregory, whom I know many of you are familiar with. It was during Linda's time that the publication first began to take on color. I think that if the right slide's up there, you're seeing the first issue that appeared with color on the cover.  </p>

<p>My Own History with Dream Network,</p>

<p>including a brief Dream autobiography</p>

<p>In 1989, literally on summer solstice, I was informed that the Bay Area Dream Workers had accepted my "bid," so to speak, to take responsibility for the publication.  And I'd like to go on kind of a diversionary path here for a moment and share a little with you about my history with dreams and my history with the Dream Network, because I recognize that I'm a stranger to most of you.  This is kind of a labyrinthical tale.  I hope you'll be able to follow along with me:</p>

<p>It starts back in 1975-76.  I was in a very, very busy part of my life, living in the Pacific northwest and working full time, raising my family, in a new marriage.  One afternoon on a weekend, I took a nap and had the most extraordinary dream that I'll probably ever have in my life. It is the first dream that I ever recall as an adult.  I remember dreams from my childhood but this one was like going to a full-length movie.  When I awakened, I went, "My goodness, what on earth was that?" I'd been keeping a journal for several years and I immediately wrote down every detail of that dream.  In the dream...</p>

<p>I found myself going into the community center where I was, actually where I actually worked, where my office was located.  It was a multi-service community center.  And rather than the typical kinds of activities that were taking place there on a day-to-day basis in waking reality, there were... Oh, as I was walking down the hallway... In this room there'd be dancers dancing, and in this room there'd be musicians playing, and in this room there'd be artists drawing...  And it was totally full of people who were doing all kinds of creative activities.  And as I went to the back of the building, into the area where (in daytime reality) there's a basketball court, there were groups of people working, constructing. I couldn't tell you what they were constructing, but they were using hammer and nails.  And every time, they were hammering in unison, and every strike of the hammer was in concert with music that was playing in the background.</p>

<p>It was just a lovely sight to see.</p>

<p>That's a part of the dream; that's the tone of the dream.</p>

<p>That particular dream must have carved some new pathways in my psyche, because it was at that point in time that I began dreaming and recalling my dreams prolifically.  I didn't know what was happening.  I was seeking out everything I could find.  That was not long after Patricia Garfield's and Ann Faraday's books had come out, and I found those, and found a Jungian who lived in the community and went and spoke with him, learned a few things from him, continued to dream...</p>

<p>Time went on, and in the fall of 1981, I was reading our local, weekly paper.  We had just elected a mayor in our community of Port Townsend who was a jazz pianist, and his wife was a flautist, and they were both very environmentally-conscious.  It was a very extraordinary and wonderful era in that community. He wrote a weekly column in the paper, and in August of 1981 his column said, "Is there anyone out there who'd be interested in coordinating an event to honor the 35th anniversary of the United Nations?"  For a number of reasons, which I won't go into now, I was compelled to respond to that call.</p>

<p>I called together a group of my colleagues.  We had a meeting, literally at the office where I worked in the community center. And as we were brainstorming ideas about what would we do in our small little backwater town to acknowledge the United Nations anniversary, I began getting a full-blown memory of the dream that I'd had back in '75-76, and I said that to the group.  I said, "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!"  And one man said, "Well, we've got to do it then."  Thank God!  I mean he just picked right up on it.  There wasn't a beat that was skipped before he said that.  Each of us took a piece of the work away from that meeting and proceeded to coordinate this event, which occurred on October 11, 1981. The entire event, itself, was like walking through the dream that I'd had five years ago, step by step by step.  There were no details missing.  I was existing for that time, at that intersection between the dream reality and this reality, off the ground. It started at noon and continued until two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>In some of the rooms we had arranged that artists would be there drawing portraits.  We had arranged in other rooms that there would be international foods available. In other rooms, we arranged that there would be information booths sharing news from countries in which there were concerns like apartheid, and so forth.  And, in the back room, we had a program later in the evening that went on and on and on. It just did not want to end until it finally did at two or three in the morning with Sufi dancing. It was just an absolutely wonderful and very successful event.</p>

<p>It was at that time that I knew something of extraordinary significance had just taken place and, on some level, a commitment was made in my soul to learn more, to understand more. At the same time, I'm still in this busy part of my life where there wasn't a lot of opportunity to seek out information.... and there wasn't a lot of information available.</p>

<p>Well, not long after that event happened, I had a visit from a friend -- a woman poet  -- by the name of Christina Pacosz.  She had been published a few times in the publication.  And she came to me to ask, to tell me that she had just received a letter from a man in New York City who had just started a publication called the Dream Network Bulletin.  And he had asked her to find someone in the northwest area to, what her words were, "to focalize dreamwork."  And she said, "You're it."  And she gave me the letter and encouraged me to write him.  I sat down immediately after she left and wrote Bill Stimson a letter and sent a picture of myself off to him in New York.  Fortunately, I kept a copy, I don't know why, but I made a copy of that letter before I sent it off.  But I never got a response. It just felt, after two or three, four months went by, like it had gone off into a black hole in space.</p>

<p>So once again back to the, you know, 8 to 5.  I'm back to work. This event that I just talked about, the poet coming to me, happened in the fall of '82, and I don't remember much, because I was still in that hurricane of work and family and so forth until the fall of 1987, when the harmonic convergence occurred on August 17.  I'd been carrying that date forward in my journal for about 20 years, because I thought it was going to be the magic moment, you know, the ‘blink of an eye’ that we’re all waiting for. And I was invited to a number of different events that were happening to acknowledge that occurrence, but decided to go to a place nearby Boise, Idaho, to an event that was called, "Dancing the Dream Awake." It was sponsored by Brook Medicine Eagle, and it was an all-night dance/ritual around the fire to acknowledge and celebrate the beginning of this period that we're in the midst of right now.</p>

<p>After returning from that event, I can only say that things began to change very rapidly in my life.  It wasn't very long before I decided to let go of a 20-year career as a public servant, in a wide variety of very interesting jobs.  I was very fortunate, but it was time to let go.  I wasn't certain what I was going to do, but I knew that it had to have to do something with dreams.  I needed to learn more.  And so what I did was apply to a graduate degree program that I had found that would allow me the opportunity to co-create, with my committee and faculty people, a study plan that met my needs.  And I found that program and was accepted. It was Vermont College, at Norwich University. In the early stages of that program, one of my first responsibilities was to meet with my committee and faculty people for the purpose of designing the study plan.  That process took place in California, in the spring of 1989. I went to Southern California and developed the plan.  We worked over a period of two or three weeks.  I got my study plan approved.</p>

<p>At that time, I had moved back to my home state, Utah.  When it was time to leave California, which is a two-day trip, I took a different route than I normally do, and stayed on the west side of Hopi land.  I was on a Navajo reservation, that night staying in a Navajo-owned motel. I want to back up just one minute and tell you that, while I was in the process of developing this study plan, I had relocated the Dream Network.  I had found out it was being published out of San Jose and subscribed while I was in California.  So the night that I'm staying at the motel on Navajo land, west of the Hopi reservation, I had a dream.</p>

<p>In the dream, I saw  papers hanging from the branch of a tree, blowing in the wind, and heard a voice say, "If you don't do it, somebody else will." I woke up and wondered, "What on God's green earth could that possibly mean?"  I had no idea.</p>

<p>I made my way home to Moab, Utah, which is where I've been off and on for the last 40 years.  Shortly after I got there, now with this new project, this new adventure before me, this new challenge of the graduate degree program, I was all ready to launch in it...  But not long after I got there, something occurred which is very typical in that part of the country, and it was a period of seven to ten days of absolutely relentless winds, 24 hours a day, just stirring up all of the sand in the desert, and making it virtually impossible to feel like you could complete a task in the way that you normally would, because it was very unnerving.</p>

<p>After two or three days of trying to accomplish something and being unsuccessful, I decided to stop trying and threw a few books and my journal in the day-pack, and walked up a canyon, a very beautiful canyon that I live near, and spend the day in a cave, a beautiful cave...In fact, a cave that I was guided to in a dream some years before.</p>

<p>On my way up the canyon, I stopped at my mailbox and, lo and behold, there was my first issue of the Dream Network Bulletin!  It had just arrived and so I put it in my day-pack, headed up the canyon, got about half way up the trail (it was going to be a mile, mile and a half, before I got to the cave)and I heard a voice say, “You’re going to see a snake.”... then immediately, a snake slithered across the trail. I said thank you to the voice,  hello to the snake and went on my way.</p>

<p>When I got to the cave...  (it's a beautiful cave. If you ever come to Moab, please look me up.  I'll take you there.  You won't believe it.  It's absolutely gorgeous!) ...and I  took everything out of my day-pack.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was grab the new issue of Dream Network, open it at random, and the first thing I saw was the graphic image of an eye with a snake coiled in the pupil, and it just...goosebumped me!  Ah, I'll never forget that moment.  I knew something was about to happen, and when I turned just inside the front cover, the words that my eyes fell on were,</p>

<p>"This publication is seeking a new Editor/Publisher."</p>

<p>Well, I threw everything right back in my day-pack, ran back home,  called Linda, and began communicating with her -- a communication that took place over a two or three month period of time, both by phone and letter.  As I said earlier, on summer solstice 1989, I was called by Linda and told that the Bay Area dreamworker’s group had agreed to pass the responsibility, the torch, and the beauty -- and what an adventure it is! -- on to me.</p>

<p>Not long after Linda informed me, she put out her last issue from San Jose. In it, she introduced me.  Shortly after that issue came out, I got a call from Chris Hudson, and here's where I'm going to go back to my story about Chris, because he had just moved from Brooklyn to Bellingham, Washington, very nearby where I was living, and was very excited that the publication was going to be happening so nearby him.  At that time, I was again in the northwest doing my graduate degree program. By the way, I know that part of my tale has got to be confusing because I was literally like a pinball, bouncing back and forth between the northwest and the southwest during this period of time. So don't get too confused.  I was on the Olympic Peninsula and back in Utah quite a number of times during that period. Chris called and wanted to come over and meet me.  So we agreed on a weekend, he came, and it was a very beautiful day. I had decided to suggest that we go to a beautiful park in Port Townsend to have our talk.  He was agreeable. So we went to Chetzemoka, got out of the car, began walking into the park, and Chris stopped in his tracks and said, "My God, I've got a picture of you sitting right over there in that flower garden."  And I said to him, "How could you have a picture of me sitting over there in that flower garden? We just met 15 minutes ago!"  And he proceeded to tell me that when responsibility for the publication was handed to him by Bill Stimson, that there were a good number of unopened pieces of mail.  Among them, the letter that I had sent to Bill back in 1982, which contained my picture.</p>

<p>One gets a feeling of a certain amount of destiny when these kinds of things happen.</p>

<p>Evolution of Dream Network in current years</p>

<p>The next few slides are some pictures and images of the issues that have come out over the seven years that I've been doing the publication. During this past several years, we've evolved, naturally, a few new dimensions to the publication.</p>

<p>One of the first steps that I took was to develop a Council of Advisors, and I'd like to just name those people.  Many of you know some of them, and some of these people may be completely unfamiliar, but I really want to acknowledge them because they've been an incredible help and aid to me on so many occasions:  Kelly Hunter, she's from the east coast; Stanley Krippner, most of you know; Marcia Lauck, who is here in San Jose and co-author of "At the Pool of Wonder"; Will Phillips, who you all met a short while ago; Bill Schuman, from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Barbara Shor, from New York City; and Graywolf/Fred Swinney, from southern Oregon.</p>

<p>There have been other individuals who have served during my time that include Montague Ullman, Jeremy Taylor, Deborah J. Hillman, and all of whom really taught me a lot and helped a great deal during the period of time that they served in that capacity.  We also made a decision to focus each issue around a question or a theme and that seems to have worked very well.  It narrows the focus so that we aren't wandering too far over creation.</p>

<p>We've developed a statement of purpose.  I'd like to read just an excerpt of that for you:</p>

<p>"Our purpose is to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams.  We seek to disseminate information that will assist and empower us in taking responsibility for our  cultural, emotional and spiritual well-being, with the help of dreams and mythology.  Our goals are to unite and serve those who respect dreams, to empower dreamers in demystifying dreamwork, and to assist with the integration of dreamsharing in our culture, in whatever way of integrity is shown and given us.”</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, we've activated the title of the publication by encouraging committed and knowledgeable dreamworkers around the country...and in  Canada, France,  Germany, South Africa... to become listed in each issue as Networkers/Contact Persons.  Over 50 individuals are listed in each issue of the Dream Network, and are there to respond to your calls, your questions, your needs, to point you to resources, to point you to existing dream groups or help you form dream groups.  So those individuals are listed, and willing to share and make the path a lot smoother for new seekers than it was for us.</p>

<p>We've also evolved from what was a 24-page publication to 52 pages.</p>

<p>We've currently developed a presence on the World Wide Web - that's been an incredible experience to say the least.</p>

<p>We've begun just recently accepting advertising.</p>

<p>We created one subject-specific booklet that's composed of articles drawn from our very rich archives.  The one that is now published is, "The Art of Dreamsharing and Developing Dream Groups."  And we hope to publish a series of booklets bringing forth so many of these beautiful words of wisdom and experience, and articles that have only really been seen by a small handful of people over this last 14 and a half years.</p>

<p>And lastly, we're being distributed nationally on a relatively small basis, but nevertheless, being distributed nationally.</p>

<p>I'd like to close by reading and sharing some of what I've learned over this past seven years, and something else that I believe that we all have in common:</p>

<p><strong>Exploring the Mystery of Dreams</strong></p>

<p>Together we have learned that dreams constitute a field of</p>

<p>meaning and purpose as vast and complex as our knowledge</p>

<p>of the known universe. </p>

<p>We know that, although we're just becoming reacquainted,</p>

<p>other cultures and civilizations in the world have valued,</p>

<p>cherished, utilized, and manifested dreams and visions for centuries. </p>

<p>Many have been persecuted over the past 20 centuries</p>

<p>for doing the work we share today. </p>

<p>Like mercury, the field of dreams is elusive,</p>

<p>a mystery, expansive, ever evading definition,</p>

<p>description, categorization,</p>

<p>and forever earning our respect.</p>

<p>I believe we all agree that dreams are meaningful and purposeful.</p>

<p>We know that we all dream every night,</p>

<p>in fact many dreams each night.</p>

<p>Not all of our dreams are recalled,</p>

<p>and not all that are recalled can be readily</p>

<p>comprehended or shared with another.</p>

<p>We know dreams are essential and vital tools in therapy,</p>

<p>still they can be engaged in silence,</p>

<p>in our journals, with our spouse, our children, our neighbors,</p>

<p>in dream groups, because we know we all dream every night.</p>

<p>We have learned that dreams can be incubated to solve problems,</p>

<p>answer questions, provide guidance.</p>

<p>Dreams often give timely warnings for ourselves or for another.</p>

<p>Dreams provide insight, bring darkness into light.</p>

<p>Dreams awaken us, frighten us, shake us up,</p>

<p>puzzle and perplex us, allow us to waken within them. </p>

<p>And, if we're inclined, to control them.</p>

<p>We can meet together in the dreamtime reality,</p>

<p>a time and space beyond time-space.</p>

<p>In dreams, we can fly or die, and be reborn.</p>

<p>Dreams show us the future, shed light on the past,</p>

<p>even past lives.</p>

<p>In dreams, we're often prepared for the death of a loved-one,</p>

<p>and there is provision of ground for contact with them</p>

<p>from the other side.</p>

<p>Dreams are known to have been the catalyst for authoring books,</p>

<p>composing music,</p>

<p>creating new inventions,</p>

<p>inspiring poetry,</p>

<p>creating art and sculpture.</p>

<p>Dreams prophesize.</p>

<p>Dreams are spirits' way of speaking to us.</p>

<p>Dreams heal.</p>

<p>In one word, dreams Reveal.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><!--nopreview--><h2>The birth of my new dream-inspired song</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>This song and the fact that I chose to record it are inspired by a number of dreams. I have experienced many dreams spread over a couple decades that encourage me to record and share more music. Many such dreams involve various famous musical artists. These come at least monthly, sometimes weekly, and occasionally more often. I am lucky to be amongst the tiny percentage of people whose dreams include music and sound. </p>

<p>My newly released song <em>“Lucid (Never Felt As Good)”</em> was originally inspired by a music-only dream where I “received” the lyrics and melody from the song’s opening line and chorus. Just before I awaken, I clearly hear a disembodied voice singing, <em>“Wherever I’ve been in my life, I’ve never felt as good as when I’m with you.”</em> This type of dream melody with lyrics is not unusual for me, but I liked the tune and decided to experiment with it on guitar. Within a few weeks, I composed more lyrics and created a chord pattern and song structure around the dream melody. That was the easy part. </p>

<p>Then came another dream, again music only: <em>I hear the last few notes of the song’s guitar solo bridge as a distorted electric guitar.</em> Again no visuals, but what seems to me a clear suggestion from the muse to switch the feel from acoustic/folk to more rock and roll, especially for the solo. The sound of the electric guitar solo in the recording is much like I heard it in the dream. I recorded the song with friends but the quality was low. Dreams urged me to again record more music and I decided to revisit this song since I felt it was kind of catchy. The recording-arranging process spread over 10 months. In that time, I had multiple dreams encouraging me to continue recording and arranging it. Towards the end of arranging, I had a breakthrough evening where I found the sound I was looking for. I went to sleep very late, but happy. In the morning, I had what felt like a celebration dream: </p>

<p>*A spiritual teacher of mine is strolling along the red carpet. Waking, the dream feels related to the song. *</p>

<p>A week or so later, when I was having trouble blending the mix, another dream came: </p>

<p><em>I’m with my sister at the breakfast table, listening to the current mix with her. It seems that the mixing process is dragging on far too long on the last few notes. I am also shocked to hear that the drums and guitar arrangement has been changed and now sounds quite heavy metal, though it sounds good in an unusual way. At that point, I decide not to change the arrangement any further.</em></p>

<p>Within a couple weeks of completing the recording, Grace has blessed this song with air play on about 150 radio stations so far and I am very grateful. </p>

<p>Among other music I’ve composed, dreams also inspired the recording of my fun environmental song Polymers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU</a></p>

<p>Life has now blessed me with well over a thousand lucid dreams, so to share some of the dream and lucidity skills and insights that have come my way, I lead lively online interactive teleclasses about how to harvest dreams for creativity (music, art, inventions, film etc.), healing, life path guidance, spiritual growth, adventure, etc. ℘ </p>

<p>The phenomenon of flying in one's sleep is truly a miracle. If, as they say, ontogeny recapitulates philogeny, then consider the premise that we are all, at some time in our primal development. equipped with tail, gills and wings and all other aspects of an the creatures that live in air and water, especially fish and birds. The fact that dreamers can fly and breathe underwater as well as free fly in their sleep without any previous instruction or practice may be related to this innate, though undeveloped, potential.</p>

<p>For some years I have been collecting flying dreams. Everywhere I go I ask people how they fly. I want to include in this book a few of the interesting reports I've received, both to encourage dream flyers to share their adventures and to inspire others, especially those timid dreamers who have never experienced free flying, to try to relax and develop your will to fly.</p>

<p>The styles of flying are far more numerous than I ever imagined. They include flapping, soaring, sitting, lying, swimming, flopping, breast and butterfly stroking, dolphin kicking, whale tail snapping, and the yoga sit style of flying. </p>

<p>Then we have ASSIST FLYING: people empowered to fly holding a stick, a magic wand, or by riding a refrigerator, bed soaring, carpet flying, floor grabbing, back packing, and, most original, something called bloodpressure cuff pump flying. There is low and high altitude flying. Some can fly only a few inches off the ground. Some can do barn storming. A young woman says she flies, but never above the telephone wires. My son claims he's expert at indoor ceiling hovering. Some people jump to take off and fly at head height. Some fly at building height. Some are totally weightless for outer space flying. </p>

<p>We have human jet travelers and cosmic trans-gravity floaters. Some run on trans-spirit supersonic propulsion. Many hover out of their bodies. </p>

<p>Then there are just plain old fashioned BIRD flappers. Some have to make a great effort to stay up, while others rise off the ground at will. We even have those who fly in the body of another. </p>

<p>There are stories about effortless flight and stories of flight frustration. Some people go somewhere and others go nowhere. You can fly for joy or what one man calls efficiency flying; the only way to get there faster. Some dreamers are propelled by fear, called the fight or flight style. Some Guru followers know about spiritual transcendance, and a gal from California describes orgasmic cartwheeling. </p>

<p>We have stories of people who fly on air channels, people who FLY TO SEE and people who FLY TO FEEL. METHOD FLYING uses guide ropes or long stride takeoffs. Ordinary arm flapping is common, but fish tail flopping is rare. Some dreamers have to run in air or they can't stay up. One physicist uses the balling up method where he shoots through the atmosphere. A mathematician on my street does what he calls the tadpole wiggle. He says he can also sit on the back of a couch and slip out through the top of his head. Some of the experienced meditators say they do levitation rising. </p>

<p>Then there is intention flying versus guided imagining. I've got stories about losing power in midflight, as well as flying faster than light. One woman from the midwest says she flew to her father racing death, and was able to say good by before he died. Some dreamers tell about floating through walls, through floors and windows. They can float down stairs, or descend head first diving, spinning, dancing, with arms backwards and arms forward. Some have no arms at all. </p>

<p>Upside-down flying is more difficult, says a girl from New Hampshire, because you can't see where you are going at all. I'm waiting for more information about ecstatic flying orgasms. The girl who can bring them on at will says she has invented a dream pill and has a teachable Olympic routine of sexual acrobatics and tandem flying. </p>

<p>While presenting some dream programs for the "outer-most" listener supported radio station in Provincetown Mass., I received more contributions to my collection of flying dreams. I am fascinated by the variety of methods, positions, problems and adventures of those lucky dreamers who have the flying skill on command.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-0.jpg" alt="Hoffman at his computer" /></p>

<p>Dreams have long been a source of inspiration for musical composers of all genres. For example, Richard Wagner – who once wrote that “all poetry is only true dream interpretation” – recounted in his autobiography that he was unable to find a way to begin his gigantic Ring of the Niebelungen cycle when he had a dream in which he felt that he was drowning in overwhelming waves, while the figurations of an E flat major chord sounded in his mind. When he awoke, he realized that his dream had provided him with the opening of Das Rheingold, which is set at the bottom of the Rhine River. </p>

<p>When I proposed doing a symposium on music and dreaming to some colleagues at the 2010 IASD conference, what I had in mind to present was exploring how music finds its way into my dreams and how my unconscious mind is able to recognize musical themes and compositions. However, recent events in my dream life have transformed this study into an exploration of how music found its way out of my dreams and into a partially finished composition. </p>

<p>I have journaled my dreams for the past 19 years, using a database program that allows me to retrieve motifs with ease over the entire period. Out of a total of 9,696 recorded dreams, 332 contain the words “music” or “musical” – an average of 3.4% of the total. Over time, the number of musical dreams averaged 17.3 per year, and tended to increase to a peak in year 11 (2002-3), then to decrease to around the mean, and lastly to increase again sharply, starting in year 18 and continuing to the present (2009-11). (See Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-2.jpg" alt="Graph" /></p>

<p>In addition to these two keywords, there have been numerous other occurrences of musical genres in my dreams. Music has always been a part of my life; I trained as a clarinetist from an early age and played in bands and orchestras through my second year in college. Over the past 9 years, as the result of a dream I reported in DNJV24#1, I have returned to instrumental practice on the crumhorn, a Renaissance double reed instrument ancestral to the oboe and the English horn. Mostly my interest is in classical music, but as Table 2 shows, both jazz and rock music appear in my dreams and are part of my waking appreciation, also. Missing from this list—and of less interest to me in waking life—are popular music, folk music, country, hip-hop, rap, and such genres. They do show up in my dreams, but more rarely. So, this listing somewhat parallels my musical tastes. However, as I do not consider myself to be a particularly good singer, it is a bit surprising that song shows up at the top of the list.</p>

<h3>Table 2: Genres (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Song – 100 <br>Performance – 96 <br>Tune – 86 <br>Symphony – 46 <br>Opera – 25 <br>Voice – 23 <br>Jazz – 20 <br>Concerto – 17 <br>Rock – 16 <br>Classical – 10 <br>Prelude – 10 <br>Overture – 7 <br>Duet – 7 <br>March – 7 <br>Hymn – 6 <br>Sonata – 6 <br>Composition – 6 <br>Trio – 5</p>

<p>Also, there have been a number of more technical musical terms appearing with some frequency in my dreams. These are shown in Table 3, and obviously reflect upon my familiarity with the language of music and its incorporation into my dream life.</p>

<h3>Table 3: Technical Terms (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Theme – 63<br>Note – 62<br>Movement – 39<br>Bass – 36<br>Key – 24<br>Tenor – 22<br>Rhythm – 21<br>Staff – 19<br>Harmony – 16<br>Measure – 13<br>Alto – 13<br>Melody – 13<br>Beat – 12<br>Tone – 12<br>Pitch – 11<br>Lyrics – 10<br>Variation – 9<br>Soprano – 9<br>Scale – 8<br>Flat – 7<br>Octave – 5<br>Sharp – 4 </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-1.jpg" alt="Music" /></p>

<p>In addition, actions of a musical nature appear in my dreams, especially playing and singing. These are shown in Table 4. (This listing does not include any non-musical instances of these verbs, such as playing games, or conducting tours.) Though I am not a profi cient vocalist, once again, singing is high on the list. Composing is rather far down on the list; while I composed a little music during high school, it is not something that I have felt motivated to do… until recently.</p>

<h3>Table 4: Key Actions (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Play – 298<br>Sing – 143<br>Perform – 49<br>Chant – 33<br>Conduct – 14<br>Practice –10<br>Hum - 10<br>Compose – 6 </p>

<p>A wide variety of musical instruments have appeared in my dreams, as shown in Table 5. Not surprisingly, the crumhorn and the clarinet—the two instruments I actually play—have a high frequency; as a crumhornist, I play with a recorder group, which might account for the frequency of recorders on the list. But I do not play piano, or any stringed or brass instruments. So their frequent appearance in my dreams would seem to derive from listening rather than playing music.</p>

<h3>Table 5: Instruments (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Instrument – 87<br>Piano – 52<br>Crumhorn – 37<br>Recorder – 31<br>Clarinet – 29<br>Drum – 23<br>Violin – 19<br>Flute – 17<br>Trumpet – 13<br>Guitar – 12<br>Reed – 11<br>Saxophone – 10<br>Cello – 9<br>Organ – 7<br>Viola – 6<br>Bassoon – 6<br>Oboe – 6<br>Harpsichord – 6<br>Mouthpiece – 6<br>Trombone – 5<br>Pipe – 4<br>Sitar – 3<br>Tympani – 3<br>Bow – 3 </p>

<p>The same pattern is demonstrated by the types of performers who appear in my dreams. As Table 6 shows, although wind players are near the top, singers exceed them in frequency; and other types of performers are not far behind. Much of the music I listen to is orchestral but increasingly, chamber music as well. I haven’t listened to much choral music, so it’s surprising that choristers appear so often. This may prefigure the developments I will discuss later in the article.</p>

<h3>Table 6: Performers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Singers – 40<br>Conductors – 26<br>Wind Players – 26<br>Orchestra – 24<br>String Players – 19<br>Table 6<br>Keyboardists – 10<br>Music Teachers – 9<br>Rock Groups – 9<br>Brass Players – 8<br>Bands – 7<br>Jazz Musicians – 6<br>Percussionists – 6 </p>

<p>A wide diversity of composers is represented in my dreams: 54 identifiable composers in all. Table 7 indicates all those appearing at least twice. Mahler and Wagner, who definitely rank among my favorites, are at the top of the list. However, the rest of the distribution is not entirely in accord with my waking life tastes. Some of my favorite composers — for example, Rachmaninoff and Vaughan-Williams — are very far down on the list; others, like Bruckner and Puccini, have only appeared once. With the exception of Michael Praetorius, none of the Renaissance and early Baroque composers whose music I now frequently play appear on this list. It might be suggested that the frequency of composers in my dreams is correlated with the degree to which their music impacts me emotionally … but the four Late Romantic composers I mentioned above, appeared only once or twice, and yet they wrote highly emotionally charged music.</p>

<h3>Table 7: Composers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p>As I reported in DNJ V29#3, during the summer of 2010 I read Jung’s Red Book and it had a profound effect upon my consciousness. Themes from the book frequently appeared in my dreams and waking synchronous experience, and in dreams, often prior to my reading them. The “biggest” dream in this series concerned my observation of a group of choristers performing an a capella cantata based upon texts from the Red Book. Upon awakening, I realized that the texts derived from the “Incantations” section of the book, in which Jung presents a series of prayers within his dreaming that was directed to the Babylonian hero Gilgamesh, whom he had previously (in the dream) mortally wounded then saved, by collapsing him to miniscule size and placing him within an egg, which he brought to a village for incubation.</p>

<p>Subsequent dreaming has made it clear to me that I have been asked to compose this cantata out of themes my dreaming presents to me. Even though I had no formal education in musical composition, I agreed to undertake this project. The first stage was to translate the words of the Incantations from German into Akkadian, the actual language of the Gilgamesh epic. My training in ancient Near Eastern languages has made it possible for me to accomplish this. Next, I am applying to the Incantations section text the specific musical themes derived from my dreams.</p>

<p>My dreams indicated that the cantata would be sung a capella by four voices, and that it would be in 6 sections. In order to manifest this, I have audited two Music Theory courses this year, which enabled me to set the melodies my dreams gave me within a tonal harmonic structure. Far from easy!</p>

<p>The first section I was moved to set to music is associated with a powerful Red Book image (Jung 2009:55): the sun barque of the Egyptian god Ra sailing over the surface of the waters, beneath which lurks a monstrous fi sh, identified by Jung as the “Spirit of the Depths.” The text consists of four lines and the melody for it was given to me in a dream. Translated into English, these are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One word, which has never yet been spoken; </p>
  
  <p>One light, which has not yet shone; </p>
  
  <p>One confusion, without equal; </p>
  
  <p>And one road, without end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-3.jpg" alt="Music spiral" /></p>

<p>Underlying the text, the Akkadian words for “Spirit of the Depths” are intoned as an undulating pedal, representing the waves. In addition, singers from time to time hold long notes on “a,” which is the Sumerian word for water. </p>

<p>The piece is in four sections, each of which corresponds to one of the four lines of the text. The first section picks up the theme of “one word” from the dream, as each line is sung solo above the bass pedal, first by the tenor, then by the alto, then by the soprano, then again by the tenor. </p>

<p>In the second section, the melody is taken up by the sopranos, harmonized by the altos, while the tenors sing the pedal and the basses harmonize beneath them. This corresponds to the “one light” phrase. </p>

<p>In the third, “confusion” section, the sopranos sing arpeggios while the altos hold the pedal and the tenors sing the melody, harmonized by the basses. </p>

<p>The fourth, “road” section, the sopranos sing descending road-like quarter notes while the altos harmonize, the tenors hold the pedal and the basses have the melody. There is a brief coda in which the pedal finally reaches the water’s surface with the soprano line and then works its way down through the voices. </p>

<p>This piece was premiered at the 2011 IASD conference to a receptive audience. A second section of the cantata was performed in August of 2011 at the same music camp that provided the inspiration for the original dream that “commissioned” the cantata. </p>

<p>Since I undertook the writing of the cantata, dreams about it have come in profusion. I have had 47 dreams in which the cantata was featured, 35 providing musical themes. In 11 of these, I have actually visualized the notes on the staff; more often, I just hear the themes. Most of these dreams are just brief snippets… or the theme occurs only at the end of a longer dream. Some dreams have provided me with insights into the structure of the cantata or helped me to revise what I have written. I know that there are themes that I have not been able to recall in the morning, but one dream early in the process informed me that these are being stored in my unconscious for when I will need them later on. </p>

<p>The creative process sometimes takes unexpected twists and turns; for example, the section performed last summer combines two dream themes in a canonical structure. I had no idea that the second theme would fi t the fi rst as well as it does. An early dream indicated that I would need to incorporate a chorale from Bach’s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> into one section of the cantata. Recent dreams have shown me that this will actually be in a rondo form, with several repeats of the chorale interspersed with other dream themes. A section I am working on now contrasts a vigorous hora rhythm from one dream against a more melodic pastoral theme from another. As Jung observed of the paintings which accompany his dreams in the <em>Red Book</em>, sometimes they didn’t come out the way he expected! </p>

<p>In many instances, I have no idea with what portion of the cantata the themes will go. But in other cases, I get the words with the music. My knowledge of music enables me to see that some of the themes bear a relationship to existing music. But other themes are unfamiliar and hopefully my dreams will give me more! ℘</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a language older by far and deeper than words. It is the language of bodies, of bodies on body, wind on snow, rain on trees, wave on stone. It is the language of dreams, gesture, symbol, memory and music. We have forgotten the language. We do not even remember that it exists.” - A Language Older than Words, Derrick Jensen</p>

    ns1:description """<p>People are becoming increasingly health conscious. Dreams, however, are often overlooked as a potential aid to good health. The following account of a persistent health problem shows how dreams can be called upon to provide continuing health care information.</p>

<p>The situation has a history that begins over twenty years ago when I had my first hangnail infection. A hangnail may sound like a minor problem, but the infection was resistant to medical treatment and led to hospitalization. A surgeon removed the infected tissue including the bone tuft. This procedure was effective, but left me with a smaller fingertip. Years later, a similar infection in another finger was treated on an outpatient basis. The result of this treatment was a healed finger that included a hard, sensitive scar tissuelike projection near the nail. I learned that serious risks accompany traditional medical care of such infections. </p>

<p>On December 1, 1984, I recognized the beginning of another hangnail, this time in the original, slightly shrunken, left index finger. It was during a period of considerable stress. I had left full time employment to complete my doctoral program in psychology. My resistance to infection was down. I was also dealing with the residual effects of flu along with persistent middle ear fluid buildup problems. In the intervening years, however, I had adopted a more wholistic life view and this time decided to take more direct treatment responsibility. I began with a small castor oil-soaked bandage. Castor oil is reported to facilitate the healing process.</p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-1.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The next morning I had the first in a series of dreams related to the finger. The dream confirmed the fact that I had a "hangnail" and would riot be seen as a "good patient" by conventional medical doctors. Several days later, the swelling had Increased and the finger was very sensitive to touch. I wrote in my dream journal, "Help, I'm scared." I feared surgery, a medically accepted treatment of choice. I could imagine what the surgeon would cut now that the bone tuft was gone. I did not want to chance losing more of the finger. Neither did I want the expense, risk, or time away from my academic work that traditional medical care would require. I now actively sought help from my dreams. </p>

<p>I interpreted an unclear dream as an indication I should see a doctor. So, on the next day, December 10th, I saw a doctor. He recommended that I discontinue my castor oil treatment, but continue with epsom salt soaks accompanied by an antibiotic ointment. I followed his advice and added visual imagery exercises to encourage the infection coming to a head, so the doctor could cut the upper skin and release the resulting pus. </p>

<p>A frightening dream came the day after I saw the doctor. In the dream, I took a piece of wood my grandfather handed me and noticed that it had termites in one section. I banged the wood on the ground and watched the termites come out, go Into a pile and then die from exposure. I then smashed the Queen and one other termite. To me, the termites in the wood represented infection in the bone. I knew that bone infections are notoriously resistant to treatment. Fear prevented me from seeing positive aspects of the dream. </p>

<p>I became obsessed with the infection. I got my name added to a prayer group listing. I began calling friends asking for their prayers. One friend, who is especially psychic, called back moments after my call. He had been meditating when I called, returned to the meditative state and asked for advice on my behalf. The recommendation which came to him was accompanied by a brilliant white light. I should use a castor oil pack. I was familiar with castor oil packs and had been using one before the doctor recommended I stop. </p>

<p>I got castor oil soaked wool felt and made a total finger pack which I used with heat for an hour and a half two times a day. My psychic friend called a couple of times during the next two days and mentioned he had also gotten the recommendation that 1 use epsom salt soaks followed by a cleansing with lemon oil; that I would see improvement in from three to six days. I followed this advice, but wasn't sure what form the "improvement" would take. The swelling began to increase and was now accompanied by redness and subsurface yellow pus which began to spread around the base of the nail. Seven worrisome days after my friend's initial recommendation I actively sought dream guidance that I could understand. I awoke with a vague impression of perforation of the skin -the idea that if I found a preparation that would help to draw out the infection at this point, that would be helpful. </p>

<p>The following day, December 18th, I saw the doctor for the second time. He carefully cut the surface layer of skin, drained off the pus and applied antbiotic ointment. The finger improved dramatically. I was more relieved than I had been in days. I was able to reflect on my consuming fears of pain, surgery, and possible failure of my wholistic measures. I got insight regarding how I developed the very fearful side of myself. I realized the powerful impact of fear and toned for situations where I had caused fear in others. I could now relax. </p>

<p>The respite was short lived. Ten days after the doctor's treatment, I dreamed: I saw an index finger with the little flap of skin turned back to expose pus. </p>

<p>I checked my finger carefully and noticed pus around the base of the nail. The infection had come back to life. I resumed ointment and castor oil treatment. I anxiously sought dream information. The resulting dreams indicated a connection between the infection and my overly strong preoccupation with it. It was difficult to reduce my preoccupation since I was constantly reminded of the problem by the ever present protective bandage and the fact that I typed several hours each day. Nevertheless, my finger did improve noticeably. Two months after the onset, it looked healed but was still extremely sensitive and barely sable. I had the doctor check it. He assured me that the finger was fine and that I had healed quickly. I knew the finger was not fine. </p>

<p>The sensitivity continued. Once again, I resumed the castor oil treatments and requested dream guidance. My answering dream included a scene where I got castor oil all over my trousers and could not find anything to wipe it off with - hardly a positive recommendation for continued castor oil use. A few days later a dream made reference to a crayfish biting one of the fingers of my right hand. The possibility of the dream being related to the problems with my left index finger were unclear. Another dream reference occurred a few days later when I dreamed of wrestling with someone "in play, but must be careful of my finger." This last dream was dramatic and revitalized fears for my finger. </p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-2.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The question was, if castor oil were not indicated, then what could I do to provide effective treatment? In desperation I began an intense search for treatment clues that included every medical reference I owned, including: <em>Conn's Therapy</em>, the <em>Merck Manual</em>, and wholistic health sources. As a result of my haH day search, I decided to use lodex, a topical preparation I had never used before. I called a store and reserved a jar, planning to pick it up the next day. That night, my dreams came alive. The following dream on February 19, 1985 was a breakthrough: </p>

<p><em>I'm looking into a school yard fenced with chain link fence. In a leanto-like shelter are two college friends sitting in a special mud. It is a life experiment! I recalled having difficulty "getting" the name of the mud. Finally I got it - ICHTHYOL.</em></p>

<p>By the time I was fully awake, I recognized lchthyol as a medication I had react about the day before. I did not associate it with my finger, but thought that the dream was somehow related to my ear problems for which I was also soliciting help from my dreams. I later reread the description, noticed a functional similarity to lodex, and then made the connection. As indicated in the dream, it was difficult "to get." lchthyol is the trade name of a discontinued product - a drawing salve. I did locate the medication under its generic name, ichthammol, and began using it immediately. Surprise! It smelled and looked like mud. I was fascinated and read more about it. The descriptions warned about becoming reliant on such preparations. I slowed down my use of the product. A dream responded by pointing out the spiritual nature of dream guidance and its relevence to my current problem. I resumed full use of the ichthammol. </p>

<p>Three months after the first indication of a problem, I was shocked by the following dream's power and lightning fast action. </p>

<p><em>I'm the lead character on stage in a play. The fellow who designed the play pushed a sword through my lapel and on through my finger. Just as quickly, he withdrew it. I looked down and was surprised to see that it didn't hurt. He had done it expertly. later, I looked at the wound. Each opening had healed, although of course it was still healing inside. I thought about putting salt water on it, but didn't think it needed it.</em></p>

<p>My immediate reaction was: IT WAS A CLEAN CUT. THE FINGER WAS HEALED. </p>

<p>In my joy of realizing the infection was gone, I neglected the statements about continued healing and salt water. Continued finger stiffness renewed my concerns. On March 14, 1985, came the last dream of the series; simply an impression that all the finger needed was exercise. Careful exercise soon brought my finger back to full use.</p>

<p>Overlooked dream clues and encouragement became apparent in a later review of the log. The critical use of a drawing salve in the Jast phases of treatment was indicated by a couple of early dreams. The reference to my grandfather was undoubtedly related to his frequent use of a "drawing salve" as treatment for job-related metal splinters. Another dream referred to a "preparation that would help draw out the infection" long before the mud experiment dream. Other uninterpretted symbols undoubtedly hold a wealth of untapped information. Dreams clearly played a helpful, dynamic andmultifaceted role in the entire healing process.</p>

<p>His thoughts floated on the mist of awareness into a dream where…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A slender, almost shapeless woman covered in silence appears before him. Her features dissolve, leaving only the sheen and smooth perfection of her short, silvery-white hair. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream woman was important. She was to be his comfort, his source of reassurance that he needed to give energy to a new dream. She would be able to release him from his worries, the worries of many elders: that their potential for making a mark in the world will be denied them in this new world of speeding change that defies comprehension. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time is visibly absent. Neither the old man nor the woman disturbs the stillness. They just stand opposite one another, seeing each other, but with no exchange of any kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>THE TIRED, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN</strong> had just changed careers. She had emerged from the stifling cocoon of a corporate management position to pursue a new life. With adrenalin-charged power, she worked her way through a grueling graduate education program right along side quick learning students in there twenties. She emerged victorious with a master’s degree, enormous debts, and only a part time job. As she drifts into dreams, she looks forward to seeing her grandfather again. In the comfort and silence of their meetings, their love for each other eclipses the need for any talk.</p>

<p><strong>THE YOUNG MAN IN HIS THIRTIES</strong> feels invincible. His power and vision are as yet unchallenged by the need to overcome the inevitabilities of future discouragement and pain. Dreams provide him with strong counselors and teachers whose advice and answers he knows will ensure success in his all-encompassing endeavors. </p>

<p><strong>THE LITTLE GIRL</strong> is spritely, engaging, and well cared for. She is growing up as she weaves her way through a world of confusing mirages, unspoken rights and wrongs, and the inconsistencies of adult behaviors.</p>

<p>In dreams ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She bravely meets the frightening and comforting lady in blue who returns night after night to stand by her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We usually consider archetypal figures—which are there to help—as being most important in our dreams… but they are not the only ones. Who we draw into our dreams as guides and helpers is influenced by our personal history and our stage of life. </p>

<p>The size of emerging problems, our belief system, our intentions for direction in life, and unconscious drives all combine to govern who will show up in dreamtime to assist us. </p>

<p>Even more so than in waking life, those who come to us in dreams allow us to grow spiritually. Respecting our gift of free will, they rarely tell us what to do. Their unstated perspective is a universal one that transcends the needs of the dreamer’s ego and focuses on the collective Whole. </p>

<p>The more we consider the seemingly simplistic question of who is the most important person in our dreams, the more complex the question becomes. Adding to the complexity is the fact that we ourselves are participants in our dreams - if sometimes only as unseen observers. </p>

<p>With the realization that the power of the universe embodied in love can be focused on us as we dream, we are drawn to an awareness of our own deep value. The dream in all of its quiet, veiled power comes to celebrate us as half-asleep dreamers, who when awake can be enormously vital and important contributors to the welfare of Humanity. </p>

<p>So we might then conclude that the most important person in your dreams very well may be <em>YOU!</em> ∞</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>“Butterfly Party” Photography by Laura Atkinson</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>As I unlocked the polished white door of my hotel room, I recited the inscribed jet-black lettering that read: "June 12th, Procession of the Unmarried Woman. In which single women walk through the centre of their village looking for a husband. (Palestrina, Italy.)" I felt obligated to check the calendar. Yes, indeed it was June 12th. On an afternoon that supplied an abundance of heavy, dark clouds pregnant with moisture, I had set out on a solo journey to navigate a foreign railway system determined to find my own way to the city. I asked the universe “..please show me some signs to follow…” In retrospect, that fine lettering seemingly indicated the type of day it had been. </p>

<p>Months before, I began selling my belongings; furniture, knick knacks, dishes, paintings and more. I left behind the city apartment which I had called home for 14 years and started my journey to be with my partner of 5 years in his beautiful European country. Too soon after arriving, I found myself on a plane returning to the States. These events would prove to be the pivotal moments for my individualized catalyst of change. </p>

<p>Being an artist, photographer and devoted dream journalist, I had always considered myself to be moderately skillful at recognizing dreamscape symbolism. Admittedly I am not an expert interpreter, but I consider myself capable of identifying their appearances and working with them. As I wandered my way back to the States, uncertain of any predetermined destination, it felt natural to ask my dreams for guidance. My dreams had been my constant friends in the past, but now I was depending on them.</p>

<h3>Thin Veil of a Butterfly</h3>

<p>I dream of being wrapped in thin silk from head to toe. It is wrapped around my legs and arms, quite difficult to move. I wiggle my arms above my head and push my hands outward against the silk. Through its transparency I am able glimpse a view to a new world…</p>

<p><em>7/12/10</em></p>

<h3>A Visit to the Butterfly Garden</h3>

<p>It was my second visit to the garden nursery in Rhode Island. The warm, milky sunshine and abundance of flora provided a sweetly scented backdrop to what would be the beginning of an ongoing and wondrous experience in synchronicity. With my camera strapped around my neck, I walked upon a pebbled walk-way through a beautiful butterfly garden. Like fidgety toddlers, the butterflies were not behaving and refused to sit for the portraits I longed to take. Rarely would they land on a flower and if they did it was never long enough to catch their image. I shook my head with impatience and was ready to put my camera away. </p>

<p>From the corner of my eye I caught sight of a grey-blue painted, metal chair sitting alone at the corner of the garden. Delicately dangling from the curved edge of the chair was the chrysalis of a Monarch butterfly. It captivated me, those fine details of tightly folded orange and black wings that could be seen through the translucent casing. As I gazed upon it, my dream from earlier that month immediately entered my consciousness. I became the solitary cheerleader for the emergence of this little creature. I stayed with the Monarch for over 45 minutes as it struggled from its outer shell. In my mind I heard unspoken words <em>“You cannot rush a butterfly,”</em> nor can you help it break free of its cocoon, otherwise the risk exists of damaging delicate wings. I simply watched and waited patiently while I slowly snapped photographs of the small miracle unfolding before my eyes.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Consignment Store</h3>

<p>After arriving in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I was introduced to a lovely little consignment store. Nestled among four butterfly dessert plates was Jung’s book <strong>Synchronicity</strong>. Having never read it before, I purchased it, thinking: “Well isn’t that a nice coincidence!” Little did I know that this synchronicity of change and butterflies was still in play. </p>

<p><em>8/24/2010</em></p>

<h3>The Mountain Top</h3>

<p>I drove with my car windows down to an overlook pass on the top of Buffalo Mountain, my camera and Jung’s <em>Synchronicity</em> on the passenger’s seat. I parked my car and grabbed my newly purchased book. It was at that moment a lemonade-yellow butterfly fluttered in through the passenger side window, landed on my arm for a few moments, and then flew out the driver’s side window. My internal dialog asked: <em>Is this a dream? Am I awake?</em> And my inner voice answered my question with another question: <strong><em>Does it make a difference?</em></strong> I decided to simply be moved with the moment, enjoy the metaphor, the beauty, the symbolism, and just become present with the experience. I followed the flight pattern of this single yellow butterfly as it landed on a group of soft-purple milk thistles. Then I watched in awe as at least a dozen more multi-colored butterflies of various species began landing on the flowers surrounding it; each one, carried by the soft wind, landing right before my eyes. Among the many there was a Monarch with its recognizable markings, a deep black butterfly with metallic blue luminescence spotted with pumpkin orange and white droplets, a butterfly speckled with colors of curry and saffron, and my special lemonadeyellow butterfly sitting tall on the highest thistle. Softly and gently they went about their daily business of sipping nectar and picking up pollen, each pausing briefly on the tips of the thistle. I stood alone for an hour on top of the blue-green mountain with only the butterfly-party as my company as I captured their images.</p>

<p><em>8/25/2010</em></p>

<p>So how do I define the butterfly experience? Great question. I had been navigating without a map for several weeks, asking the universe to provide guidance, some signs about the path I am on; provide some sort of divine inspiration I could draw upon. And in response, my dreams answered as did the collection of “coincidences” happening with my eyes wide open. </p>

<p>The continuing butterfly events were dreamlike and awe-inspiring. With my camera I have been intentionally, physically and symbolically “shifting my focus.” My 20/10 eyesight provides minor details at great distance on the horizon, but in doing that so frequently, I often fail to see what’s right in front of my eyes. What I had been doing is purposefully noticing and appreciating the finer details. </p>

<p>This series of experiences not only raised the bar but it shifted it as well. It triggered a new awareness from within, and united it with a new appreciation for symbols and synchronicities. Just as I am capable of interpreting the metaphors and symbols that dreams provide, the time has come to start acknowledging and working with the signs and symbols while awake. Quite possibly, this is what it is all about. Shifting focus to see the microcosm, the macrocosm, the foreground, the background, connecting it all and being open to “seeing” it all, including the coincidences that thread it all together. </p>

<p>I will openly embrace synchronicities that may unfold in both future waking and sleeping dreamscapes, for I know that my personal transformation is not over. You cannot rush a butterfly. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>At a most fascinating time in my life when I was learning how life can respond in real time to the lessons I was /am learning internally, I had the following experience:</em></p>

<p>One summer night, I am walking on the street towards the subway. A car passes with dogs barking out of the window. The barking reminds me of a quote I had read recently about “listening to the barking dogs of the unconscious” (i.e. noticing subtle experiences like nightmares that try to catch our attention with an important message). The driver stops and asks directions and I gladly tell him how to find the street he is looking for. I continue to the subway, contemplating a principle I seem to be learning in my life, symbolically exemplified by the passing car and barking dogs... about how it is wise to give help to people when they ask for it. I don’t think it applies in every situation but there seems to be some truth to this principle, at least spiritually speaking. Like Jesus might have meant when he said, <em>“Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened.”</em></p>

<p>As I descend the subway stairs, I am a little lost in my thoughts when I see an old gentleman slowly hobbling down the steps with a cane. Without thinking twice, I ask him if he needs help. He does not look at me but he does say something very odd: <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> He has a British accent, which is quite unusual in Montreal. I’m confused by his response, yet out of good will I repeat my offer to assist him. He shakes his head and says,<em>“It might be a little convoluted, but hopefully you get the point.”</em> </p>

<p>Well, I don’t get it, but I wish him well and continue down another couple flights to the subway. Nearing the bottom, it strikes me that perhaps the old gentleman is trying to help me learn the precise lesson I was contemplating as I entered the subway, since I twice offered him help when he hadn’t asked for it. I immediately run back up two long flights of stairs to speak to him again. </p>

<p>At the speed he was hobbling down the steps—unless he was completely faking it—there is no way he could have either passed me or even turned back and left the subway. In the 20 or 30 seconds it takes me to sprint back to where he <em>should</em> still have been, there was, amazingly, nobody there! </p>

<p>His peculiar statement suddenly seems to make sense. He said, <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> I laugh at the magic of the moment and return to catch my train, no older gentleman anywhere to be seen. ∞ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>It was time to dig those old dream journals out of the basement. Yes, they were all there stored in plastic storage containers, thirty-three years worth. The early journals were 9½ by 6 inch spiral notebooks. That spiral format had many advantages. Those notebooks could be opened and laid flat and were easy to write in even when lying in bed. And, the day’s events could be recorded on the left side with the resulting dreams of the next morning beginning on the right. They also came in all different colored covers adding a bit of fascination to them. Years later, larger format spirals replaced the small ones only to be replaced still later by three ring binders. </p>

<p>With all of those journals, the question was where to start. An approach that included spot reviews of dreams from ten, twenty, and thirty years ago was appealing. Opening one of the containers, however, revealed the very first notebooks. My plan went out the window. Those early notebooks were just too fascinating to be ignored. My dream work had begun just before my daughter was born. There were the documented worries about Elizabeth who had developed toxemia toward the end of her pregnancy. There was the record of an early dream incubation to let me know what I could do to help her. The dream came through in a simple piece of music, “It’s Sleepy Time down South.” The message was clear. I just need to help her get as much sleep as possible. </p>

<p>The faithfully kept records of days’ events were there too: the exhaustion from getting the nursery ready, even a comment my mother had made that she had climbed up on a chair to hang curtains the day before I was born. There were notes about all the help we had gotten from friends and neighbors. Then of course notes about the joy I experienced when Shannon was born and how amazing it was, just to hold such a precious and beautiful little person. </p>

<p>In true synchronistic fashion, the early journals revealed other things of interest to my current waking life: the name of an old friend that had been eluding me; and toy train dreams that fit in with a problem I’ve been having trying to fix a toy locomotive.</p>

<p>Having given up on the idea of an organized dream search, I followed an impulse to look up the circumstances surrounding the writing of my first article for the Dream Network Journal in 1987. There it was, a note that my article had been published, with a star drawn next to the note showing how pleased I was. </p>

<p>But while looking for references to the DNJ article, I came across a dream of my daughter’s when she was five years old, in her last year of preschool. The dream had been a favorite for years. I remembered it being about a scary monster wearing yellow boots. Because of the dream, I spoke to Shannon’s teacher about little Ritchie, who I recalled wearing yellow boots to school and w known to bite other children. In a quickly arranged conference, the teacher reassured me that Shannon was safe and that she almost never interacted with Ritchie.</p>

<p>As written, however, Shannon’s dream was much different than I remembered. </p>

<p>*I was going that way and I saw a man with big green boots. You know? Like Ritchie’s boots. He was going in big high puddles. I wanted to kiss my mom. He let me kiss you dad because mom wasn’t home. Then he took me home. I’m glad that dream didn’t come true. I don’t like dreams that come true. *</p>

<p>The dream was multi-layered. The meanings, which related to school, big men, high puddles, home, and Shannon’s relationships with her mom and me, are still not entirely clear. On one level, the man represented Ritchie. I had taken action on that assumption. A brief entry the next day indicated that I was with Shannon when she drew pictures of the big man from her dream who wore green boots. Taking control of the big man in her drawings had been effective. He did not return to her dreams. I don’t recall if I had dealt with the dream issue of Shannon’s mom being unavailable or if I encouraged Shannon to share the dream with her mom; but if it had happened today, I would. Her mom and I would have discussed Shannon’s need for reassurance, concerning her mom’s availability. The outcome might have at least resulted in Shannon getting some additional cuddling and an extra kiss or two. </p>

<p>As a young mother herself, I wondered what Shannon would recall of the incident all these years later. Because she lives nearly a day’s drive from me, I scanned and attached the dream journal page to an email and gave Shannon a follow-up call. Shannon said that the dream seemed unusual to her in a couple of ways. In the dream, her mom was not home, but she recalled her mother as always being at home. The dream did not trigger thoughts about her mom being unavailable. Reading the dream, however, did trigger memories of her being a very frightened child. To me, Shannon hadn’t seemed to be a particularly frightened child. During our conversation, I learned about some of her childhood concerns of which I had been unaware. </p>

<p>Eventually our conversation moved back to the present and the topic of availability. Shannon wanted to make sure that I would continue to be accessible to her and the grandchildren. We realized that we hadn’t been visiting as much as we would like. As a result, we scheduled visits that we’re both very much looking forward to.</p>

<p>After putting down the phone, I felt much better about having carted those dream journals around for so long. They not only helped correct and enlarge on old memories, they also confirmed the enduring importance of old dreams. Because dreams are so relevant to the present and come with perfect timing, it may be tempting to discard dreams after they have been read and interpreted, the way we used to discard day old newspapers. Luckily for me, I had kept those old dreams as well as some of my daughter’s. Randomly finding and revisiting one of my favorite dreams of hers was more valuable than finding a gemstone. That old dream had helped strengthen our relationship when she was only five and helped re-strengthen it again over a quarter of a century later. And the icing on the cake was that it provided the catalyst for strengthening relationships with my granddaughter Annabelle, who just happens to be approaching age five, and her three-year-old brother Alex. </p>

<p>After looking at all those old dreams, they with a doubt have relevance for the present and don’t seem to be quite so old after all. ∞</p>

  <p>“Nothing happens unless first a dream.” - Carl Sandburg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to talk to you about <em>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</em>, my current dreaming project. In order to do so it is necessary to first give you a little background about myself and about the fairly unique dreamwork process in which I have involved myself over the past thirty years or so. </p>

<h2>Some History</h2>

<p>I was fortunate that fairly early in my career in that I was asked to direct a small, non-profit organization in Virginia Beach, Virginia, called Poseidia Institute. At that time, the focus of research was on the intuitive process — what made people able to do such things as accurate psychic readings(?), for example. What made it possible for ‘healers’ to ‘cure’ and ‘telepaths’ to give information for someone halfway around the world? </p>

<p>Because these questions were primary to my own research as well, it quickly became clear to me that dreams — whatever else they may be — are the one altered state of consciousness we all share. Therefore, talking to people about dreaming might reduce the general awe in which psychics and psychic phenomena were held, that is when they were not being denied or ridiculed. </p>

<p>So I began with the premise that we are all psychic, that being psychic is our nature. It wasn’t long before the necessity to examine the nature of time and space became important to me as well, since the psychics I knew often talked about alternate realities, or other areas of time and space. </p>

<p>These were interesting times in the field of dreams, during the 1970s. John Herbert, Richard Wilkerson and others summed some of that history up in articles in the last issue of Dream Network. </p>

<p>On the East Coast, Dr. Henry Reed was publishing his <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> for the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE). This journal served the function of bringing dreamers into dialogue. So popular was this quarterly journal that, when the ARE stopped its production, a New Yorker by the name of Bill Stimson decided that something needed to be done to keep the grassroots dream community going. He was so convinced, that he started a small publication of his own, the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, which was an immediate precursor of the Dream Network you now hold in your hand. </p>

<p>The staff of Posiedia Institute was involved in these events, with other editors of the DNB, Suzanne Keyes, and Linda Magallon. We were all volunteers in a project we called <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em>, a group dreaming experiment. </p>

<p>At the same time Henry was publishing the <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em>, he was also conducting his <em>Dream Helper</em> experiments, a process he had devised for getting people incubate dreams to help another dreamer. </p>

<p>In conversation one day, Henry and I decided it might be interesting to see if dream helpers could work with someone they’d never met, or met only briefly. So it was determined that the next person who filled out an application for a psychic reading from one of Poseidia’s staff of very competent psychics would be, if they were willing, the target for a Dream Helper experiment. </p>

<p>The majority of people coming to Poseidia for readings at that time were there for medical assistance, often referred by their doctor or therapist. So when the next application arrived, we invited the young woman to participate in this joint ARE/Poseidia Institute experiment. </p>

<p>What occurred to me the next morning, when the ‘dream helpers’ met to report their dreams—myself among them—was that not only had several members of the group accurately targeted the young woman’s illness, but the dreamers actually appeared to have shared dreams.</p>

<p>This subject of sharing dreams fascinated me so much that I decided to devise some sort of experiment to see if people could share dreams, possibly even lucid dreams, on a planned basis. This was the beginning of a set of experiments which took place over several years. The results of these experiments more than convinced me that spontaneous mutual dreaming is fairly common, though not so commonly reported; I was also convinced that skills such as mutual, and even mutual lucid, dreaming can be developed.</p>

<p>It was out of this background then that I returned in 1996 to The Association for the Study of Dreams. As one of ASD’s earliest members, I had presented at the second ASD conference in Charlottesville, Virginia, but then left dreamwork behind for doctoral work at American University, and later for work as a senior Science Fiction/ Fantasy editor. </p>

<h2>We’ll Cross That Bridge When We Come To It</h2>

<p>So how does all of that bring us to the World Dreams Peace Bridge?</p>

<p>The period between 1985 and 1995 was very important to the study of dreams. In California, Linda Magallon continued the study of mutual and group dreams, finally resulting in her book, <em>Mutual Dreaming</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1997. Interest in dream lucidity continued to grow, supported by activities like Ruth Sacksteder’s Lucid Dream Exchange. </p>

<p>Although there continued to be an interest in both interpretive dreamwork and theoretical dream research, dreamers were also becoming interested in such things as Dr. Stanley Krippner’s ongoing research into Shamanic dream practices around the world, and the work of Australian author, Robert Moss. These researchers and others were talking about the important role dreaming has played in world cultures, apart from the more scientific models of Western culture.</p>

<p>I have often told the story of sitting at a table overlooking the ocean on the terrace of the beautiful University of California Santa Cruz campus, with a group of some of the top experts on dream lucidity. Someone asked how people had first become lucid. One man responded, holding up his hands, “I looked at my hands.” One by one, around the table, people grinned and held their hands in front of their faces in silent homage to Carlos Castaneda who, even if he made it all up, introduced an entire generation of dreamers to lucidity through <em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em>. </p>

<p>During the decade in which I was away from dreamwork, more dreamers had become conversant with theories of time and space presented first by Albert Einstein, followed by an entire group of nuclear physicists and popularized by writers such as Gary Zukov, Michael Talbot, and Fred Alan Wolf. Now it was not so unusual as it had once been for dreamers to believe that possibly consciousness—particularly dreaming consciousness—could extend beyond the boundaries of linear time and cross the boundaries of space. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly the single most important development of the decade was the Internet, where almost as soon as longdistance communication was possible, dreamworkers like the Rev. Jeremy Taylor, John Herbert, Jayne Gackenbach, and Richard Wilkerson were communicating globally with dreamers around the world and constructing Internet dream resources which far outshone anything available to dreamers prior to that time. </p>

<p>When I returned to ASD in 1996, almost the first thing I did was volunteer to moderate the Online Bulletin Board at http://www.asdreams.org. I was fascinated by the potential of the Internet to link dreamers with one another and to provide instant communication. Whereas before, when the <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em> research was going on, weeks of sending dream accounts and responses through the mail were discouraging to dreamers. Now communication was instantaneous, free... with the click of a key. </p>

<p>As soon as I began to moderate the Online Bulletin Board, I noticed one less-than-surprising thing: a majority of the questions—from kids writing school papers, from adults with sleep disorders, from dreamers all over the globe—focused on subjects which, heretofore, had been classified under ‘paranormal’ dreaming or ‘anomalous’ dreams. There were questions about out-of-body experiences, about dream telepathy, about mutual dreams and experiences of sleep paralysis. It seemed that this type of dreaming, far from being paranormal, was — if we were to believe the people who came to the Bulletin Board — very normal indeed. </p>

<p>The visitors to the Bulletin Board, some of whom became so regular that we began to call them Boarders, carried on the practice of grassroots dreamwork which began in the seventies. Even though dream interpretation is not done on the Bulletin Board, wideranging questions about dreaming and dreamwork are discussed, with equal participation from therapists, sleep and dream researchers, artists as well as from dreamers themselves. </p>

<p>In the two years after I began moderating the Bulletin Board, Ed Kellogg developed the Paranormal Dreaming Forum on the ASD site, and we began also to create ASD Member Pages, which allowed for members to put up a page online, introducing themselves and their work. It was not long until I conceived a plan for bringing International members even closer, through the medium of the Internet. In 1998, I invited ASD members around the world to participate in the construction of the Online Guide to International Dream Work. This project not only provided a stunning array of multi-language pages for the ASD web site, but it also built a feeling of camaraderie among the ASD members working on the project, even though they lived in Greece, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and many places in between.</p>

<h2>The Effects of 9/11</h2>

<p>Given my sensitivity to the issues of interest to the online dream community, it wasn’t much of a stretch for me, when I saw the televised report of the second plane flying into the Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, to go to the computer and invite people to post their dreams and feelings to the Bulletin Board. I saw the number of precognitive dream reports without surprise and before long I was writing an article called “Dealing With Precognitive Dreamer Guilt,” <a href="http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm">http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm</a>, which Richard Wilkerson generously published in his online magazine <a href="http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm">Electric Dreams</a>. I was touched by the outpouring of sympathy and understanding, which came to the U.S. from dreamers around the globe. </p>

<p>Then, as the bombs began dropping in Afghanistan, two of my lifelong interests came together with a very loud click. I have been a pacifist ever since, as a graduate student in the 1960s, I did Conscientious Objector counseling for the American Friends Service Committee. </p>

<p>I remembered the plenary speech Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, director of Pacifica Graduate Institute, made at the 1999 ASD Conference in Santa Cruz: <em>‘Dreaming the World.’</em> That lecture caught my attention because Aizenstat was saying what I had believed for years: that people, and all sentient beings, are dreaming the world into existence, all the time. </p>

<p>This is not a new idea, having been the foundation for Aboriginal Australian culture for thousands of years, as well as fundamental to other indigenous cultures. Numerous psychics, such as Edgar Cayce and Jane Roberts, have said the same thing. </p>

<p>In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace. </p>

<h2>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</h2>

<p>In October of 2001, I sent an e-mail to approximately one hundred people: friends, family, those ASD members who had worked on the Online Guide to International Dream Work, inviting them to join me in a discussion group, which I later labeled the first-ever longterm group journaling experiment. There was something that had struck me in my own briefly precognitive dream on the morning of 9/11. In that dream, <em>I was standing in the control tower of an airport, watching as an air traffic control person dealt with an obvious emergency.</em></p>

<p>What struck me about the dream was that, although I was in the control tower, I was only an observer. My dream reminded me that I had the ability to respond, a response-ability to be in control, as we all do if we believe that we are dreaming the world. </p>

<p>In the last issue of <em>Dream Network</em>, Richard Wilkerson labeled this emerging attitude as Dream Activism. In fact, there are other groups now following the model of the World Dreams Peace Bridge, and there are a growing number of dream activists. Is this a new concept? Not entirely. During the time between the emergence of ‘grass roots’ dreamwork and today, many dreamers have recognized that — from a certain position in the dream, often a lucid dream, and sometimes a group or mutual dream — it is possible to act consciously from the dream state, to communicate with others and to participate in creating the magic of reality. </p>

<p>The World Dreams Peace Bridge, which maintains an active membership of around fifty people, is composed of dreamers from around the world: Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, New Zealand, the U.S. and many other places. In its waking form, as a discussion group, the Peace Bridge operates as a support system for dreamers. New ideas are explored; dreams are told; because of its international membership, news is often reported from one country or another before it is picked up by the press. </p>

<p>At the dreaming level, the World Dreams Peace Bridge has acted as a catalyst for creativity. One example of this is the Peace Train Project, which has grown from a dream Jeremy Seligson dreamed in Korea in August 2002. </p>

<p>In the dream, <em>Jeremy was riding with a group of people on a train across the country. The train, which bore a banner calling it the ‘Peace Train,’ ended up at a platform on which President Gore stood.</em></p>

<p>From the dream, when he first recounted it, Jeremy began to muse. What would happen if people all over the world began to create peace trains? What would happen if children were asked to create peace trains? What would peace trains carry? </p>

<p>Other members of the group began to get enthused and now—less than a year later—Peace Train projects and Peace Train workshops have been held or are planned for Korea, Australia, India, Turkey and the United States. UNESCO has praised the Peace Train Project. Jeremy has created a Peace Train song and is working on a video. There will be a Peace Train workshop at the ASD Conference in Berkeley in June. And the Peace Train Project has brought more dreamers to the Peace Bridge. </p>

<p>By the fall of 2002, the World Dreams Peace Bridge had become so active that we needed to create a web site. With the work of webmistress, Liz Diaz—who had already designed a beautiful World Dreams logo—<a href="https://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org/">http://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org</a> was created. The site, among other things, now houses a marvelous collection of art, which has grown out of the dreams of various peace dreamers. </p>

<p>Most recently, in the time just preceding massive world-wide peace demonstrations against U.S. attempts to convince the United Nations to approve war against Iraq, members of the World Dreams Peace Bridge sponsored a Peaceful Solutions Dream In, inviting not just members of the Peace Bridge but dreamers everywhere to join us in attempting to dream up peaceful solutions to the world’s conflicts.</p>

<p>In my own estimation, these are good questions for all dreamers to consider, not just dream activists. In the work I was doing at Poseidia Institute in the 1970s, I was often told that I was ahead of my time. Recently, when I helped to facilitate ASD’s first PsiberDreaming Online Conference, an online psi event that had participants asking for more, I was told that my first book on dreams, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, published in 1980, had withstood the test of time. But, for myself, I have seen Dream Activism as a natural development, an outgrowth of believing that dreams might predict the future or support such things as lucid/mutual communication. </p>

<p>Much has happened in the past thirty years to convince Western dreamers that we might be creating the world (or many worlds) through our dreams. Dream Activism, or projects like those of The World Dreams Peace Bridge, are no more than our attempt to become increasingly more conscious of what we already know to be possible. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It all began in a dream telepathy contest, where strange – stranger-than-usual – things happened.</p>

<p>It was 2006, my first year attending the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) annual online PsiberDreaming Conference (PDC), which always includes psi dreaming contests. For this one Beverly D'Urso was “sender,” endeavoring to mentally transmit a target image. We contestants were to post our dreams online; when four pictures were posted we'd each choose which best matched our dream; then judges would select winners with the best “hits.”</p>

<p>On the designated night I took off flying and called out, “Beverly, show me the picture!” I found myself “flying over a snowy scene.... A stretch of bare soil... a very large dog appeared.... Another smaller, darker dog was with him... possibly rescue dogs.... Suddenly I was indoors looking at and hearing an announcement of the answer... pictures of different types of dogs.”</p>

<p>Mary Pat posted her dream just after mine: hers had “reindeer with red leather harnesses... intense cold, rounded hills of snow and ice....” and then, “the image of a dog, nothing else, the background dark.... I realized he was a husky....”</p>

<p>At least four others dreamed of snow. Bob dreamed of a snowball fight, then twice of dogs: one on a bed with him, one on the bedroom floor. Val dreamed her parakeet was “the size of a large dog”!</p>

<p>When the four picture were posted, surprisingly, none had a dog. But one was a scene of snow and bare ground – with two elves looking up into pines: a young one in a gray jumpsuit, a scowling older one in a red pointed cap. Had anyone dreamed the elves? </p>

<p>Yes! Sonia's dreams had a boy in a gray jumpsuit; B.A.'s, a boy, then “a red triangular shape.” Dolores dreamed of two dwarves in pointed red caps. Ilkin got the facial expressions: “Grumbling/curious.... Looking for something.... Snow.” Patricia dreamed of elves sheltering in a tree from a storm; “the dog alerts them....” </p>

<p>Some dreamed evergreens and Christmas scenes. It was like putting together a puzzle. Indeed Ed, an experienced psi dreamer, dreamed that he failed to solve a blue and white interlocking puzzle on a white countertop. He correctly took this as a clue that the dreams of snow were better “hits” than his! </p>

<p>We were delighted when Beverly revealed the target: the elves-in-snow. Then she posted her own dreams from her night of “sending,” including this: “Extremely large dog... climbed into this little bed with me. I was saying, 'No, no, no....'”!</p>

<p>So where did all the dogs come from?</p>

<p>Finally Suzanne disclosed that, the same night, she'd also participated in another dream psi experiment. The target? A team of sled dogs in the snow!</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-0.jpg" width="300px" height="auto" alt="Snow target image with two elves"></img></p>

<p>Discovering these and other complex interconnections unfolded an extraordinary camaraderie. Kathy posted that she was “impressed with the way people are dreaming together – we seem to have woven a tight fabric of related dreams in the last 24 hours: a harmonious dream song....” </p>

<p>I agreed. “What an experience – tuning into shared dream-space with not only Beverly but, as it turns out, all who participated.... Everybody wins by participating and experiencing our connectedness. There could be no greater reward.” </p>

<p>The judges deliberated an extra day, citing “the strange and wonderful things that happened,” then gave ties for first, second and third with a flock of honorable mentions.</p>

<p>I posted, “It was difficult to evaluate my own dreams' relation to the target without looking at everyone else's. Think how fun and rewarding it would be if that were the object of the game! – especially if choosing among possible targets as in [this] contest – treat it as a group dream and say, for instance, “Wow, there's a lot of snow in here! …And look at all the elves. I vote #1 is the target.” </p>

<p>Six years later I helped create just such an event for the 2012 PDC. The Group Remote Viewing Game proved a splendid test of the hypothesis that a group can work together to generate dream clues, then solve a mystery. </p>

<p>But I've told that story elsewhere (IASD's Dream Time magazine). Here, let's play with a less-testable idea: Do people dreaming toward a common goal form something like a group mind? </p>

<p>The target: King Tutankhamun's golden funerary mask. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-1.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"></img></p>

<p>The dreams: multiple puzzle pieces, including two or more of each of the following: ancient cities, artifacts, the Middle East, rulers, spiritual figures, temples, ceremonies, statues, portraits, boxes, graves, dimly-lit rooms, mummy-like wrappings, gold – lots of gold. And there were surprising mirrorings in ways dreaming minds interpreted these themes. A few among many oddly intersecting dreams that pointed to the target:</p>

<p>Dale dreamed, “I am traveling to a remote place where I witness some type of ceremony inside a building... possibly a communion.” Jay dreamed “a single image. A flat smooth shiny green leather case... containing a shiny metal plate (paten) with a single large communion host on it.”</p>

<p>Sarcophagus-like, the case holds what many Christians call the body of Christ, considered – as Egyptians considered the Pharaohs – both God and man. But why green? Perhaps because Rita was dreaming of a “magical/mystical... green box”?</p>

<p>Rita also dreamed of a golden “statue of the Mary, the Madonna” while Valley was dreaming of “the embodiment of Mary [with] large dark living eyes.”</p>

<p>No one dreamed “Egypt,” but Carol dreamed initials UR and thought of the ancient Mesopotamian city, while Kate dreamed “a repeating motif of blue and aqua” reminding her of "the detail work on an ancient frieze from Mesopotamia.” </p>

<p>Kate had apparently zoomed in on the mask's lapis lazuli and turquoise inlays. It also has alternating blue and gold stripes; Sharon dreamed gold stripes on a gold-framed portrait of a revered and famous man, while Ed dreamed blue stripes on the head of a powerful, reclining magician.</p>

<p>Now here's another unscientific notion. When people dream together, does the waking world collaborate?</p>

<p>Maria recounted her experience on the night designated for dreaming the target. “I have a model of Tut's sarcophagus [that] toppled over that evening for no apparent reason, obliging me to take notice of it as I set it right again....”</p>

<p>Carol was deliberating which image best matched the group's dreams when when “out of nowhere” an acquaintance told her, “Maybe you were a pharaoh's daughter in a past life.... I thought of you last night when I turned on a movie and watched The Mummy Returns!” </p>

<p>When I revealed the target, Kate was listening to a presentation on her iPod. “The presenter started talking (out of the blue) about Egypt, pharaohs, and how people had said Obama looks like a pharaoh.”</p>

<p>And at that moment Carol heard “Walk Like An Egyptian” on the radio.</p>

<p>A few participants' closing remarks:</p>

<p>Sharon: “So glad we all did what we did together. It does work....”</p>

<p>Maureen: “It's nice to feel that the combined vision, the pieces of the puzzle that each dreamer contributed, each in his or her own way – really made this event work.... I'm very, very impressed with the success of this event and the rich psi content of the dreams....The communal focus felt extraordinary to me.”</p>

<p>Laurel, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.: “'We must give an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in our individual societies.' Seems like this game has been an excellent example of a group coming together in this way.”</p>

<p>Tony: “It's been a lot of fun and left me with a very strong feeling of – what's next!”</p>

    ns1:description """<p>In the process of living, I often incubate a dream to get information. So, in keeping with the current Dream Network theme, I turned to dream incubation to give me additional understanding about the experience of living one's life as if it were a dream. </p>

<p>My incubated dreams are often quite understandable so I was expecting to get some quick and easy to understand information. Instead, I got a middle-of-the-night dream about a family that had been getting light over a period of years. The meaning of light as well as other dream elements, however, all lacked clarity. The dream itself seemed to be more like the waking process of ‘brainstorming’ often used to generate ideas. </p>

<p>After jotting down the dream, I had to use the bathroom. Without turning on any lights, I walked into the bathroom and saw a star through the window, beautifully framed by an opening in the surrounding tree branches. I realized that the light of the star could in some way be a continuation of the focus on light in my dream. As I turned from the window, my attention was caught by a lighted wall switch. The thought occurred to me that seeing lights could be the beginning of a waking nightmare experience if I allowed it to be. That realization triggered more thoughts of lights before I was able to bring the train of thought to a close. </p>

<p>I began walking back to the bedroom without switching on any lights that might disturb the sleep cycle. Even so, my eye caught the lighted switch in the hallway. Then, upon entering the bedroom, the lighted switch on the electric heater caught my attention. The realization came that if I didn’t jot down the unusual waking experience of noticing/seeing these lights, the recall might drift away in dream like fashion. So, I groped for my flashlight, and realized that I was faced with still another light. </p>

<p>Possibly the awareness of the parade of lights in my nighttime waking moments had been initiated by the dream theme of collecting light. The experience was not particularly pleasant. To eliminate the unpleasantness, I considered the more comforting thought that when we see “the light,” we’ve gotten the answer. Conflicting with that idea was a bunch of nighttime scribbles in my dream journal that contained no simple answer about waking as a dream. As the disappointment became clear, I heard a still small voice say, “Wonderful.” At hearing the voice, my resulting excitement blocked out whatever was supposed to be so wonderful. </p>

<p>So, I turned off my flashlight to go back to sleep. As I did so, I saw the glow from the digital display of my clock that I had carefully covered so I wouldn't see the light. Agh, more light. I figured that there must be a message here somehow about seeing the light. Next, I realized that I’d forgotten to put in my mouthpiece to avoid nighttime teeth grinding. So, I got up again and had difficulty finding it because the night-time glow built into its container had gone out. </p>

<p>The experience with light was becoming more complicated and difficult to understand. With relief, an idea came to mind from Ralph Blum’s The Book of Runes. He writes of the desire to immerse oneself in the experience of living “without having to evaluate or understand.” With that in mind, I could go back to sleep. </p>

<p>The next day, an old choir friend gave me a call. During the course of our conversation, I told her about my recent dream along with my intention to learn more about experiencing waking life as if it were a dream. She didn't seem to resonate with the topic. Instead, she said, “Well Arthur, you know the first thing God said was ‘Let there be light.’” She then proceeded to sing a song as a prayer for me that finished with “May God’s light shine on your face.” She brought our conversation to a close by repeating the last line of the song. </p>

<p>Later, as I sat back and contemplated the call, I realized that not only was the focus on light continuing in my life, but also that I’d been given a heart-felt gift. That gift of a blessing was related to immersing myself in and being conscious of my waking and dreaming experiences. My dream incubation process that had been designed to more fully understand waking as if one is in a dream certainly yielded unexpected results. The results were reminders of a number of factors including: the powerful effect of intention on our dreams and waking; the back-and-forth flow of information and emotions between dreams and waking; how the mystery of light is alive and well; the question about which comes first, the dream or the waking and finally, the un-predictability of life, the energy drain that can occur when trying to understand things, and the fact that there just aren’t any simple answers. Possibly most important, however, was the reminder that by immersing ourselves in life—and ‘The Light,’ we can experience satisfaction and a fullness that no amount of understanding can bring. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Whenever I am getting ready for a radio interview or a talk, I try to anticipate the questions. I usually get questions like … How can I remember my dreams? Do dreams answer questions? Do they foretell the future? What does the dream I had last night “mean?” </p>

<p>But on this particular talk show, I was thrown off a bit. The kind lady on the phone handed me a really simple, basic question. But it caused me to hesitate. To think a bit. </p>

<p>Her question: <strong>What is a dream?</strong></p>

<p>I thought back. Had any of the so called dream “experts” answered that question? I have noticed that most writers of dream books dive right in, assuming everyone knows what they are talking about when they discuss dreams. </p>

<p>The question is definitely worthy of a thoughtful answer. So here is my take on it. My response draws on my understanding of ancient wisdom and eastern philosophy. Our personalities have three aspects: the physical, the emotional, and the mental. The brain is part of the physical aspect. When we die, the physical aspect ceases to exist, but for some time we continue to experience emotion and retain our mental capabilities. </p>

<p>When we dream, we are experiencing a state of consciousness similar to death. Our physical senses are shut down, but our emotional and mental aspects are running full steam. Dream researchers tell us the brain is still functioning during dream periods. The motor and emotional areas of the brain are highly active, enabling us to actually “experience” the dream. But I think the dream is less a function of the physical brain than it is of the mind, an aspect of ourselves that transcends the physical. </p>

<p>In the dream state we are free from the distractions of waking life. Free from our day-to-day concerns. I compare it to the Hubble telescope. Scientists knew that to fully experience the universe they had to free themselves from the bounds of earthly atmospheric distractions. In the dream state you can experience whatever happens to you without thought of prejudice, of what it will cost, of who is watching you, of what will happen if you fail. Here your mind receives objective information. Even better, in the dream state you are connected to universal consciousness. You are able to see all the universe has to offer. Your dream is what you see in your Hubble telescope. </p>

<p><strong>What <em>is</em> a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information. A dream is what you would be thinking about if you weren’t so busy working, or buying things, or paying bills, or worrying, or seeking pleasure. </p>

<p>As you sleep, at the end of a day of working, buying things, paying bills, worrying, seeking pleasure, whatever … your mind processes these events and all the emotions associated with them. It considers them in relation to all that you are and all that you could be. Your mind selects a theme—an essential issue, idea, or perception— that your need brought to your consciousness at this point in your life. Your mind then attempts to present this theme in a form you can understand. </p>

<p>Most of us are accustomed to the narrative, storybook form. So, for most of us, the mind attempts to tell us a story. This story presents the issues you need to deal with in your waking life. These issues are normally things you know about but are avoiding or afraid to face. They may be things of which you are not yet conscious. </p>

<p>Of course, not everyone processes things in this narrative sense. For instance, artists may just experience visual images, with no storyline at all. </p>

<p>We are told that Billy Joel and Sting are given their musical inspiration in the dream state. I know a potter in Virginia who first “sees” her new projects in dreams. Artists, scientists, and other visionaries often experience ideas, perceptions, and new perspectives in their dreams. </p>

<p>At the point of waking from your dream, you have choices about what to do with your new-found objective information. You can ignore it and say, “It was just a dream.” Or you can act on this profound message that has come to move you forward, to take you to a new level of understanding about yourself and your world, to give you new insight into your skills and abilities and what you can produce. Someone said, “We cannot discover new oceans unless we have the courage to lose sight of the shore.” Dreams are asking you to be brave, to take a step forward into new adventures. They are asking you to explore the mystery. </p>

<p>True, they are normally filled with complicated symbolism. True, they are normally asking us to consider some degree of change in our lives. These concerns do not have to stop you in your tracks. I believe the quickest and best way to get past these hurdles is to seek out the core messages—the themes—our dreams are asking us to explore. </p>

<p>Consider a recent dream you have had. Ask yourself, what is the theme of this dream? Generally, did it deal with how you differentiate yourself from others, or how you express yourself, or how you interact with others, or how you capitalize on your experience? Think in terms of broad issues. For example, in the dream, did you experience need, vulnerability, success, failure, exploration, new discovery, adaptability, sharing, love, desire? Were you threatened or criticized? Did you have trouble communicating or applying your knowledge and skills? Did you feel out of control or restricted in some way? Were you surprised to learn there was some new world to explore or some new direction your work can take? </p>

<p>These are all common themes in dreams. But your specific dream is not “common.” It deals with you and your life. Ask yourself where in your waking life you are experiencing these issues or feelings or activities. Finally, look back at the details of the dream to see if it contains new information or clues about how to deal with waking life issues or how to develop and present new ideas or perceptions.</p>

<p><strong>What is a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information from deep within you and from the universe around you. It is coming to help you grow. To find your role in the world. To be the best you can be. To be free and to be whole. Honor it by acting on the specific message it is asking you to address. </p>

<p>For more information on themes and how to work with them in your daily dream work, I provide general information on my website, <a href="www.heartofthedream.com">www.heartofthedream.com</a>, and more detailed information in my book, Dream Exploration: A New Approach. ℘</p>

<p>My career started as a photojournalist for a weekly town newspaper. My style has evolved to include nature, dreamscapes, landscapes, and travel &amp; tourism. I’ve been awarded grants and won awards for my imagery, and have exhibited on both coasts of the United States.</p>

<p><em>Photography Then–</em> My first “real job” was at a local newspaper in my hometown. After talking with the editor, he gave me a few photo assignments on a trial basis. A month into this new photojournalist position, I had my first of many front page photos.  It meant lugging 50 pounds of camera equipment through seventeen local communities on assignment for human interest and breaking news stories (and through all types of crazy New England weather, too!) I stayed with the newspaper for 7 years before enrolling in computer training school.</p>

<p>My formal art training at Rhode Island School of Design included alternative photographic processes and design.</p>

<p><em>Photography Now –</em> I have been exploring the links between art, visual therapy, and the realities of the dream state for many years. My work, while being a deeply personal exploration of my own dreams, jars the viewer with its beauty of light interplay, form, and design. Its my intention to create a tactile beauty that brings viewers into my private world while simultaneously giving one the permission to touch, feel, and experience each piece, while making it part of his/her own world, language, and life.</p>

<p>I take a very “Zen” / organic approach in creating recognizable images that strike a resonate chord. My approach to making photos is a quietly hidden metaphor for the ever changing fluidity of our dreams and frailty of beauty. A haunting reminder of how both shimmer before us, but can disappear in the blink of an eye. An eternal aide memoir that everything is not always as it appears to be.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>"Just when you thought nothing new could be written about dreams, Janice Baylis has applied chaos theory and complexity theory to dream interpretation. Her suggestions are grounded in cutting edge paradigms." Stanley Krippner, PhD. Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University</p>

<p>How I, Janice Baylis, got interested in dreams: In 1959 a fellow teacher had major surgery. We set up a car pool where I picked her up in a strip mall parking lot and drove the 30 miles to our school.  One morning Mabel phoned and asked me to meet her around the corner on the residential street.  She said she didn't like her car taking up space in the store lot all day. </p>

<p>I said, "Okay."</p>

<p>As Mabel was getting into my car that morning, we heard an enormous CRASH!  A small airplane had landed upside down in the corner of the parking lot where we would have been.  Then she told me she had dreamed it during the night. "WOW!" exclaimed my eight year old son, Brad, from the backseat.</p>

<p>That launched me on a life-long, self-directed and academic study of dreams. From the first, the practical side of dreaming has been my focus.  The Edgar Cayce dream material was the first I found to study.  He also emphasized the practical aspects--health, finances, job, creativity, and interpersonal, as well as the personality growth and spiritual aspects.</p>

<p>With my BA degree in Education and a MA degree in Psychology, I got a credential/license to teach dream-study at the community college level.  I taught 36 hour, semester, night classes and weekend workshops.  My students urged me to write a book, so I wrote Sleep On It! The Practical Side of Dreaming in 1977. </p>

<p>In my teaching I found many dreams use overt sexual imagery and that people were confused by the symbolism of sexual images.  I made this a secondary focus of my dream work.</p>

<p>My earliest memories include dreams and my fascination was intensified by sharing a mutual dream with my sister at the age of 11. Psi dreaming has seemed natural ever since; lucid dreaming comes easily; and I especially enjoy exploring the potential of lucid psi. I love inspiring others to expand the horizons of their dream worlds and above all I treasure the incidents that reveal our ultimate connectedness.</p>

<p>My careers have ranged from ranch hand to bellydancer but my degree is in biology and my current job title is Wildlife Biologist with a subtitle of Visual Information Specialist. You can see some of my work at my <a href="http://fatooh.org/art/">website</a>.</p>

<p>It's been my hope since my first childhood mutual dream that science would advance beyond its hesitancy to acknowledge, let alone explore, that which isn't readily replicable and measurable with current technology. Dreams seem such an accessible gateway to the science of consciousness - what could be better than an International Association for the Study thereof? I only wish I'd found it 25 years ago.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to have presented papers and facilitated discussions for IASD PsiberDreaming conferences, and recently led a workshop on lucid dreaming at the Southern California regional conference.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were no humans on the planet.  You may be too young to remember, but it seems the earth did just fine in those days.  The earth gave birth to an incredible, rich diversity of life, and yet maintained a delicate, sustainable balance between it all.  Even in the early days of human life, it seemed that we could be part of this magical balance as we found our niche and explored our possibilities.  Sure, we made mistakes in those days, but we could usually learn from those mistakes and try to do better in the next generation.</p>

<p>But recently the humans seem to be acting like the worst kind of invasive species, spreading all over the planet, dominating, killing and destroying everything in sight.  The delicate balance of life has been seriously disrupted by humans.  What is happening here?  Will the humans finally win their war against nature and thus destroy all chance for balance to be restored?   What will it take for humans to change our ways, to strive again for some kind of balance?</p>

    ns1:description """<p>By way of introduction, may I share two of the dreams/experiences that compelled me onto this path, an abbreviated dream autobiography. It is, of course, an ongoing adventure.</p>

<p>The event that marked my starting point appeared in the form of a technicolor, stereophonic sound, full length movie-like dream which was the first of its kind in my experience. Its power and beauty were such that I recorded it, not knowing why at the time.</p>

<p>Many other dreams followed, compelling enough that I started journaling regularly and began reading what related literature I could find. But it wasn't until that particular dream took the form of an actual event several years later that I got deeply involved.</p>

<p>This dream occurred during summer 1975 and in it,</p>

<p><em>I find myself in a community center (which in waking life housed the office in which I was working). In every room of this building are people participating in an amazing variety of artistic activities: dancers, singers, musicians, artists...</em></p>

<p>The energy in the dream and afterward was exhilarating!</p>

<p>In the Autumn of l980, the mayor of my community, in his weekly column in the local newspaper, cast an open invitation for "someone" in the community to coordinate an event. I considered accepting that invitation by calling together a group of colleagues to brainstorm ideas and as that process was unfolding, ideas and images were being put forth from members of the group which formed in my mind's eye a clear memory of the above-mentioned dream. To the group I exclaimed "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!" One person responded immediately: "Then we've got to do it!"</p>

<p>The program was scheduled, very well attended... and I found myself presiding over a virtual re-enactment of the dream in full detail. It was the ever-sought-after experience of Being at the intersection between the dreamworld and daytime 'reality.' The occasion for this event was the 35th anniversary of the United Nations.</p>

<p>By the way, the photo (above) was taken during that event:</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, I was working as a counselor for the City &amp; County of San Francisco. These kids were from broken homes and they had generally experienced little but abuse and neglect throughout their lives. As that time I was interested in how fantasy and creativity (and lack of it) played a role in development, but I didn't know much about dreams.</p>

<p>I began studying with Jungian analysts in San Francisco in the early 1980s, and found that dreams provided not only a wonderful arena for exploring fantasy and creativity but also provided a soulful feedback system and continual inner dialogue. After a few years I began studying with other people who worked with dreams in many other ways and shifted my focus away from pure Jungian dreamwork</p>

<p>I was especially interested in the lack of education that therapists were receiving in graduate counseling programs and began a dream tutoring practice to allow counselors from various modalities to respond to their clients' dreams in a more sophisticated manner. I felt a little boxed in by the work. The one-to-one contact was meaningful, but I felt I was not reaching a large enough audience. Also, the notion of dreams only being in the service of healing seemed limited. I wanted something that involved the wider culture. Both of these needs came together when I first experienced the Internet.</p>

<p>I began developing a wide variety of programs to network dreamworkers, distribute news, experiment with online dream sharing and provide information and education on dreams. This kind of global networking seemed the natural extension of the grassroots Dream Movement that had been developing since the 1960s, and I modeled much of the online community around this. The first part of the model I found in local dream sharing groups such as those made popular by Strephon William-Kapalan, Jeremy Taylor, Gayle Delaney, Stan Kirppner, Montague Ullman, and many others. Another grassroots trend was a networked outpouring of information, education and creative group projects that included such organizations as BADG (Bay Area Dreamworkers Group), the Dream Library and Archive, and the Dream Network Journal.</p>

<p>My initial online community, the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/ed/">Electric Dreams</a> Community, had, and still maintains at its core, a peer/partnership paradigm, and a focus towards online dream sharing. As new Internet projects came up, various members volunteered to coordinate and direct them. In this way the community remained a public service, being able to offer a monthly magazine (e-zine), continual online dream groups, the Global Dreaming News, and other projects.</p>

<p>About the same time, I noticed that there was a great need for education about dreams and dreaming and started the DreamGate classes online which offered not only a background in the field of dreams, but hands-on groups through the Net.</p>

<p>In 1996 I was part of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) Conference Committee and developed the Computer and Internet Resource and Exhibition Center for the Berkeley Conference, as well as contributing to the initial development of the IASD presence online and IASD web site, which I now manage for IASD. I have been very impressed by the way IASD attempts to provide a way for all fields to come together and study dreams encompassing all sides of the dream field, from anthropology, dream therapies, dreams and spiritual work, dream inspired art and literature, non-clinical dreamwork, dream telepathy, dream bio-physiology, and many other disciplines.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, I was the IASD Webmaster, the Chair of the Electronic Communications Committee, and provided regular articles on dreaming and dreamwork online to the IASD magazine, Dream Time in the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/dream/cyberphile/">Cyberphile column</a>. This has allowed me to develop the online projects for IASD with many, many people from around the world, and unfold the IASD mission to provide dream education for the public and to make the Association a truly international enterprise. For example, beginning in 2002, IASD began offering an international online conference with Ed Kellogg, Ph.D., call the PsiberDreaming Conference, for which I built the technical infrastructure.</p>

<p>In 2005 I became the IASD Operations Director, managing the IASD office and its operations at the office in Berkeley. In 2018 the office went virtual and is now PO Box 206, Novato, CA 94948</p>

<p>Another interest has been interested in the application of philosophy to dreamwork. How can the application of novel ideas compliment and further the developments in dreamwork?</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Ann used Milton Erickson's common-sense and self hypnosis approach to dreams. She used art, dreams, and closed eye visioning in workshop intensives here and abroad. She taught at Lesley College Arts Institute, where she helped develop the Expressive Therapies Program, trained teachers, and earned her Master’s degree. Ann kept dream journals for fifty years, published two books on dreams, and was an ASD member and presenter for over 20 years, offering workshops and slide talks at IASD (almost every year), and at California’s Esalen Institute, The Cambridge center for Adult Education, and organizations here and abroad. She derived much inspiration from the work of Patricia Garfield, Freud, Jung, Milton Erickson, Gibran, the I Ching, the Dalai Lama, and others.</p>

<p>This adaptation of her Introduction to her last book, Satisfy the Image, summarizes her work: </p>

<p>Autodrama on the Paper Stage is a concrete mapping method that works for dreams and all kinds of life problems. You create your own symbols to represent the people and things in your story and set them on a sheet of paper we call the stage. Instead of telling the story in words, we use colored paper or found objects to represent characters and significant objects—it’s very simple. As you answer questions about the scene, you begin to understand the problem and manipulate the characters in search of resolution. </p>

<p>As a mini psychodrama, it shrinks the stage to a sheet of paper, eliminates other players, and offers a quick, direct approach. Working alone or with a guide, the dreamer plays all the roles, speaks and hears the dialogue, harvests projections, and negotiates a resolution. </p>

<p>The method came to me in a dream where I saw myself as a tiny human attached to the earth’s globe by gravity. Up in the universal darkness, a giant megaphone shouted “FIND THE IMAGE AND SATISFY IT.” Immediately I understood that the way to resolution was through the image, and the way to the image was through your feelings. </p>

<p>Since the age of three, I drew, painted, designed textiles, perfected and taught various crafts. When I had kids, I made bread sculpture, rag tapestries, furniture, and toys, and then turned it into how-to books. In the 1970’s, as Program Director for the Boston Children’s Museum Visitor Center, I developed how-to workshops so visitors could make paper, build looms and kites, and invent musical instruments from junk. I also conducted workshops for the New Hampshire elementary school system: sixty to ninety teachers came once a week for five-hour sessions on “Methods and Materials” and “Creative Enrichment.” We called it “Kindergarten for creatively deprived adults,” who were then very excited to take the ideas and methods back to their classes. </p>

<p>From there it was a short step to Expressive Therapy, a field just being defined at Lesley College. In addition to teaching there, I designed and completed my own Masters program based on work I did with teachers all over the country and in India. </p>

<p>Dreams were an arrow leading straight to the unconscious. Like parables, they provide perspective on truths too close to see. Visual methods make problem solving exciting because they require you to think outside the box and use all kinds of intelligence and sources of wisdom. Impatient with the time required by conventional dream work, I asked students to “show me your dream. Show me your problem. Create images. Make characters from torn tissue papers or find an object to represent people and things. Set the stage and tell the story on a sheet of paper.” </p>

<p>In half an hour, everyone in a class could create a scene and begin to work using ten simple questions. I just walked around the room helping to move things as needed. And there was the magic of working in groups. People borrowed from each other, saw what others were doing, heard the first solutions, and were inspired to take risks or reach out. Originality was rampant. Everyone left the room with new information, and often with a new resolution. </p>

<p>A Harvard student who took a workshop said, “This work you do is more interesting than all my psychology courses. I’d like my professor to see.” I did a workshop there, but the professor asked what books I was using, what theory? </p>

<p>“No books, no theory—just common sense and the wisdom of the dream, the power of peoples’ images. We simply ‘satisfy the image.’” </p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t going to make much sense to Academe is it?” he says. </p>

<p>“No. I guess not. It is not a theory; it is an experience.” </p>

<p>So you are the system. You are the method. It’s the doing that heals, creates change, and enlightens. When you experience it, you know it. It is the “Aha!” method. </p>

Since then, he has conducted workshops on dreams in the Metropolitan D.C. area and in North Carolina. He designed a four-part mini course on dreams, which was well received in Asheville, NC. It was in these courses and workshops that he fully realized the importance of themes in the dream work process and the need for formal guidelines on the subject. He has found that themes are the most misunderstood aspect of dream work.</p>

<p>Below, you can download each volume as a .zip file, or download each issue individually from the list of images. If you'd like to look up an individual author or article, here's a (not-quite-complete) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfm83Fnx9m9Q_Bfu3bpDv2kQqUwDG6exOj-Zny-MnMw/edit?usp=sharing">list of Dream Network articles</a> in spreadsheet form.</p>

<p>Feel free to send the PDFs to your friends, but rather than publishing them online please just link to the archive site once it's public. We also ask you not to publish the articles in the journals, unless you have the permission of the author (or you are the author, in which case, the rights are yours!)</p>
