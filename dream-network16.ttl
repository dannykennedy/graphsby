<p>I began my artistic work in the 1980’s as a graphic designer, operating my own design firm with clients throughout the state of Colorado, where I reside. During this time I also became known in the area for the historic murals I painted with private and public commissions, and for my work as President of the Berthoud Arts and Humanities Alliance, lending my support to other Colorado artists.</p>

<p>Preferring a new direction from commercial expression, I have recently begun to devote my talents to subjects with personal meaning, and my artistic work now reflects a passion for inner examination. Dream images have captivated my imagination and provide an unending source of inspiration for my paintings. It is my desire to express the mystery of the psyche’s inner world and the power of dreams to impact and change our lives.</p>

<p>In the year 2000, I was invited to be the attending artist to the International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and in 2001 my work was included in the art exhibit, “Dream Odysseys,” at the Porter Gallery, UC Santa Cruz, and featured in a presentation at the annual ASD conference. In 2007 my painting “Fall Into Fear” was awarded a Nancy Richter Briezki Dream Art Award, at the IASD’s conference at Sonoma University, CA. My articles and artwork are regularly published in Dream Network, and DreamTime magazines.</p>

<p>I am certified for professional dream work through the Marin Institute of CA.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Symbolic Sound Forms from the Akashic Records</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Roberta Ossana (DNJ):</strong> Dr. Bonnell, Thank you for being willing to share your unique gift and perspectives with our readers. By way of introduction, will you please share a bit of your background? How did you come to be an Akashic record reader? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> I began my journey into the Akasha as a child of eight. This actually came about as a result of a severe beating given me by my stepfather. I was knocked out-of-body. This experience (OBE) seems to have facilitated my ability to do so at will and I found it to be so delightful that I repeated it the next day. Thereafter, after school I would go immediately to my room, close the door and go out to my special place. About a year into this activity I met a guide by the name of E-Ly. He took me into the Akasha, or Great Hall of Records. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How would you define or describe the Akashic records? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> E-Ly helped me understand the nature of the Records by way of taking me back to when the Records were first formed by the originating Twelve Logos as a means of communicating their unique frames of reference regarding Creation in this realm without bias. As these original Souls began begetting, each subsequent Soul added their knowing to the web of energy spiraling around Earth. Eventually the concept of time was added as a means of self-discovery within the maze, or the dimensional layers of consciousness we call our reality. It was then that the need for an oversoul, a point of integration of all knowing, was added to the equation, thus creating the need to individuate self into linear formats to satisfy a progression through the maze. It is said that the Records contain all that is or ever will be, including information from all of world incarnations of individual beings.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> In your book, you speak of consciousness and evolutionary cycles, in particular the 13,000 year cycles that swings on a continuum/pendulum from Duality to Unity. The Records indicate that we are on the threshold of completing a 13,000 year cycle of duality that began with the demise of Lemuria and Atlantis... and we are now entering into a cycle of Unity that will be initiated by an Event: The Twelve Days of Light. Would you summarize this Event and its implications for the Earth and humanity? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> There are rings of energy constantly emanating from the center of Creation. If we were to look back over time to the rise and fall of civilizations we could get a fairly good idea of the intensity and duration of past waves. This current wave began to overtake us some five hundred years ago. At the center of each of these waves, no matter how long in duration, there is a period of great intensity. Every 13,000 years, a wave one thousand years thick in duration overtakes us. We are quickly coming to the center of this current wave (seventh month of 2001) and will feel an intensity event for twelve consecutive days. This event is the line in the sand between the Aquarian and Piscean ages. We, the whole of mankind, will move into a unification of body, mind and Spirit similar to that experienced during the end time of Lemuria and the height of the Atlantian period. This move from separation into Unity will be experienced by everyone, regardless of the level of preparedness. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You have sited Old Testament prophets (Isaiah and Ezekiel), prophecies of the Hopi and Mayan people and those of noted prophets like Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce . Information from these various sources seem to corro-borate that which you have glean-ed from individual readings and questions you have posed directly to the Records . Most prophets and prophecies, however, tend to focus on apocalyptic and/or negative 'endtime' scenarios. The Records indicate a place 'Beyond the Veil'-The Fifth Dimension-the ushering in of the long-awaited Age of Aquarius. What is the Light you have seen beyond the end of this present day tunnel of chaos and approximately when will we arrive there? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> Timing of this event is the single most difficult aspect of this prophecy. It has been said that only God knows when. But then if everything is God ... we know. The difficulty is in how time is determined on the other side, i.e. you have to break cosmic references into Earthly equivalents. Not as easy as it may sound. </p>

<p>This is where the Old Testament and ancient text stuff comes into play. As best as can be interpreted the exact timing of this event is around the 17th of July 2001 with the collective mind stepping beyond the boundary of time in the year 2011. The Light at the end of the tunnel is full realization afforded us by this current wave. The timing is immediate. The good news is, every lifetime you have had since the last shift in Atlantis has been the preparation for this event. You will not be left behind again. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Do you perceive that we often enter the realm of the Akashic records in the dream state? Could you give an example, please. </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> The Akashic Records are our collective gathering of data that is freely shared without bias or prejudice. Because most of us have very strong waking opinions about what is right and wrong, we are kept from consciously entering the Records . The only other primary entrance is through our unconscious state, or dream consciousness. We all get data through intuition and hunches. But these are little snippets. Dreams are whole volumes of data that pertain directly to our concerns of the waking world, mainly our perceptions of how others view our contributions. This is the human predicament: how others perceive us. Not if we are clear and lucid about our place in Creation, but how others perceive our place. Dreams are extremely important streams of data that communicate the most direct path to our self dis-covery. The data released in streams of consciousness during the dream state are from an indi-vidual's personal Book of Life held with the Akashic Records. Because of this, dreams are very important. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You stress throughout the book that our work Now is the release of conflict and that since profound conflict is the current state of the collective mind, conflict itself will self destruct. This sounds like Chaos Theory in its finest hour! Is this (release of conflict) in your opinion <em>The</em> work we need to do, individually, in 'Preparing' Soul &amp; Spirit for the Millennium? Please elaborate and provide, if you will, a Vision of how it will be for those who sustain consciousness. </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> As we get closer to this cosmic line in the sand between ages, we will see a dramatic increase in collective conflict. This will act out in some very bizarre struggles as individuals, groups and cultures let go of the need to be right about their beliefs. The more individuals who are aware of the need to let go of conflict, the smoother the transition from third and fourth-dimensional awareness to third, fourth and fifthdimensional awareness. It is up to the individuals within the context of their like-mindedness to let go and let God. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Thank you, Dr. Bonnell, for sharing with us!</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-3.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Dancing is my form of self-expression. I love to have wide open spaces to fill up with my moving body, and music with which to dance that touches my soul. Having taught hundreds and hundreds of children in schools and studios across the country, I can say with great authority that I am not alone in appreciating the pleasure of this physical sensation. Encouraging children to move freely and expressively enables them to maintain the body-mind-spirit connection that is a natural part of childhood exploration and development. </p>

<p>Although my clientele has changed from elementary children to college dancers in the last eight years, my basic goals remain the same: Freedom of expression is what I seek to unlock for college students who enroll in the Dance Improvisation class that I teach. Dance Improvisation is spontaneous movement that springs from an internal source within the individual, as opposed to dance technique, which is a codified movement vocabulary that seeks to achieve a standard of excellence. </p>

<p>My training and experience as a Dance Therapist colors my approach to the students I teach. My objective is to educate the whole person, meeting students where they are in their developmental journey and taking them further down the path of self-knowledge. When the course content is dance, this means that the dancer must thoroughly know his or her body in order to move with abandon. When the goal is to teach choreography, the art of making dances, the choreographer must go within to create work that has depth. </p>

<p>One of the most effective ways I have found of helping students access their own authentic movement source is through ‘Dream Dancing.’ Each person’s dreams are both unique and universal. By going to a personal dream as inspiration for dancing, the individual has everything necessary with which to create: story line, plot, images, action, characters, setting, conflict, climax and resolution. The aspect of this experience that opens up the individual to uninhibited movement exploration is that there is not a right or wrong way to dance a dream. Dreams do not conform to the requirements of daily life or aesthetics. They are not necessarily logical or linear, beautiful or harmonious. Therefore, there are no restrictions placed on Dream Dancing! </p>

<h2>The Dream Dance Activity</h2>

<p>As leader of the Dream Dance Activity, I structure the process carefully to give participants a sense of where the work is going and to answer any initial questions. I assure the dream tellers that they are not required to share anything that feels uncomfortable. I also give permission to stop the dream dancing process if it becomes too difficult or threatening. Then, I talk the participants through each step of the process and facilitate the flow of the session. </p>

<h2>Dream Telling</h2>

<p>The process begins by selecting a partner with whom one will take turns. The first partner verbally shares her dream material, while her partner witnesses her dream telling. Witnessing involves active listening, without interrupting the dream teller with verbal responses or non-verbal signals of approval or disapproval. This enables the person telling her dream to get into a flow-of-consciousness description of her dream. </p>

<h2>Dream Dancing</h2>

<p>The first partner relaxes in a comfortable position on the floor and allows images from her dream telling to arise. I invite her to call the dream characters back into her imagination. Then, as the music begins, the dream dancer begins moving through the shapes and postures that became vivid through the dream telling, as well as the physical actions that evolve out of the reenactment. As she explores her dream dance, her partner witnesses her movement, taking in her body posturing, noticing movement patterns, and making sure she is safe in the space (since the dream dancer may close her eyes). Music accompanies the dream dance to support the process and to provide a timeframe in which participants know they will begin, explore and complete their dances. </p>

<h2>Closure Dialogue</h2>

<p>After the first partner has danced, she receives the gift of a shoulder massage to gently bring her back to alertness. The dream dancer may then begin telling what she experienced or she may ask her witness what he observed, inviting him to reflect back to her what unfolded in the dream dance. (Partners exchange roles and repeat the dream dance process.) </p>

<h2>Dream Dance Reflections</h2>

<p>After both partners have experienced the roles of dream dancer and witness, I welcome them back together as a group and discuss important personal discoveries. I also ask students to write about and draw their in-class experience of the dream dance. The responses are as unique as the individual. </p>

<p>Jennie Melvin depicts her experience this way: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“One of my favorite things that we did in the class this semester was portraying our dreams through dance improvisation—we entered into a place of solitude and then depicted what we saw or felt. While I was ‘dreaming,’ I had an awesome experience. The image that I had was of me walking through a thick forest, dragging through mud and thorns. To me, it symbolized all the stress I was going through at the time. When I reached the end of the forest, I was on one of the most beautiful beaches I had ever seen. In the water was Jesus. I walked toward him and he cleansed me of all the mud and scrapes all over my body. It was so wonderful to dance this dream out.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Della Arrington discusses a greater personal awareness that developed out of the dream dance experience: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“A major part of the class that I enjoyed was the process in which we explored our dreams. It was a very interesting period in which I discovered that I really dream some bizarre things. I always have dreams that are either scary or very sensual. Kissing is a major theme within my dreams. As I was closing my eyes and allowing the dream to flow through my body and communicate, it was interesting to just feel my body being taken over by this passion.” Danielle Lowery describes a sense of acceptance that grew out of the dream dance process: “One of my favorite activities was the dream work session. It felt very relaxing to be able to explore my unconscious thoughts, which are usually suppressed. Working with a partner allowed me to verbally express my inner self without being judged, and also get input on how my portrayal of dreams was interpreted with music. The shoulder massage at the end of this activity was wonderful. It was as if we were being rewarded for being ourselves.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Out of the Nightmare, Into the Light</h2>

<p>The Dream Dance is not simply an exercise I reserve for students. I find it to be an excellent way to process my most powerful dreams. I don’t shy away from ‘scary dreams’ that are desperately trying to get my attention. That is where I begin. </p>

<h2>The Victim and The Perpetrator</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-1.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>In my dream telling, I begin with an anxiety-producing nightmare: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This woman tells these people she is protecting them from something evil and takes large sums of money from them. However, there is no real threat. I see her go to her car, pop the trunk and inside, there is a barrel. She takes the locked-down lid off and a very wealthy woman very slowly unfolds her body and emerges. People everywhere are being released. Then, the lie of the danger is told to all.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This nightmare brings up very strong feelings in me. Immediately after having this dream, I write in my dream journal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am horrified by the entrapment. I cannot imagine wishing to survive in that barrel. I feel like hurting the woman that trapped those people by making them victims of their own fear. As I awaken, to my horror at seeing this poor woman emerge from this barrel, I say, ’I would never have the will to survive that.’”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first response to the dream is to sympathize with the wealthy woman who paid a great fortune for protection from her greatest fear: an overwhelming sense of evil. However, there really is no external evil. Instead, her fear traps her in a place that is not fit for human habitation. She hides away from an active life. She allows physical boundaries to contain her. I am horrified by the existence she has had to endure. I can’t imagine being able to tolerate such torment. When she emerges, I can see her wealth; therefore, she must possess obvious gifts. </p>

<p>My next reaction is that I want to punish the woman who has perpetrated this atrocity. The depths of her darkness are unfathomable. How can anyone be so hateful? For me, she embodies the very worst possible female. She wins the trust of the helpless, takes their finest gifts, and then imprisons them with their own permission under false pretenses. </p>

<p>In this dream, I see my shadow reflected in both the victim and the perpetrator. As the victim, I surrender what is best about me to a situation that feels confining at its best and suffocating at its worst. Fearing to expose the very worst in me, I stuff myself into a mold. Even though I cannot breathe, I attempt to keep my Self under control, at all personal costs. The vulnerability of my soul is the victim. As the perpetrator, I commit a most horrific crime of the heart. I convince myself that what I’m doing is a necessary evil. The wild side of me needs to be kept under lock and key. The perpetrator is my Judge, she who knows best. </p>

<p>In the dream, I sell my Self out. I take all my greatest gifts—all of my creativity, love and passion—and stuff them into a filthy, dark, dank barrel which presses in on me and stops everything but the faintest heart beat and shallowest breath. There I sentence my soul to solitary confinement until I can get my Self more in line with my persona. There I waiver, uncertain I can convince myself to keep breathing, where survival does not feel like a worthy choice. </p>

<p>By dancing these characters, I begin to understand why this particular dream came to me. My dream portrays two polar opposites. Perhaps this dream is trying to help me see both of these aspects of myself: the consenting, passive victim and the perpetrator of the crime, the judge. Dancing these dream characters is a very intense experience. This place is too painful for me to linger long. I move into the protagonist of my next dream. </p>

<h2>The Goddess</h2>

<p>The second dream that I explore in the dream dance portrays a very different image of a woman: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am outside in the country on a very sunny day. I’m standing with my legs in a strong, wide stance with my feet planted in the earth, my arms flung open wide, and my head tilted toward the sky. As a snake slithers between my feet, I startle awake.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream character is a Goddess, strong and receptive. Dancing this dream feels delightful! The arm movements open from the heart. My lower body is powerful and grounded. I breathe deeply as I explore this dream image. I look upward as my gestures extend away from my center toward the sky. I also release my body into gravity, sliding toward the floor. The snake brings the connection with the dark, hidden places of the earth. Rolling and pressing against the floor, I connect with this snake energy. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-2.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This dream dance experience did not end for me when my class was over. Instead, it highlights my need to further explore these dreams. I dance these dream images in the studio alone. I write about them. I draw the barrel and the Goddess. I narrate the dream dance for witnesses. I process the dreams with a Jungian analyst. I research the Snake Goddess. I compile visual art images that portray both the barrel nightmare and the sunlit dream. </p>

<p>My in-class exploration of this dream dance exercise has sparked the dance that I am currently creating for my dance company. In the process of describing recurring nightmare images and dancing those postures and places that haunt my dreams, I realized I had a dance that needed to unfold. After exploring these dreams further, I knew that I would entitle the dance, ‘Out of the Nightmare, Into the Light.’ The title provides a road map of the dance for me. I begin with the first anxiety-producing dream, take the audience through a full range of nightmare scenarios of oppression, and then move into the light of the Goddess, still grounded by the presence of the snake. The dance is not yet finished, but the process is exhilarating! </p>

I see her go to her car, pop the trunk and inside, there is a barrel. She takes the locked-down lid off and a very wealthy woman very slowly unfolds her body and emerges. People everywhere are being released. Then, the lie of the danger is told to all.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This nightmare brings up very strong feelings in me. Immediately after having this dream, I write in my dream journal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am horrified by the entrapment. I cannot imagine wishing to survive in that barrel. I feel like hurting the woman that trapped those people by making them victims of their own fear. As I awaken, to my horror at seeing this poor woman emerge from this barrel, I say, ’I would never have the will to survive that.’”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first response to the dream is to sympathize with the wealthy woman who paid a great fortune for protection from her greatest fear: an overwhelming sense of evil. However, there really is no external evil. Instead, her fear traps her in a place that is not fit for human habitation. She hides away from an active life. She allows physical boundaries to contain her. I am horrified by the existence she has had to endure. I can’t imagine being able to tolerate such torment. When she emerges, I can see her wealth; therefore, she must possess obvious gifts. </p>

<p>My next reaction is that I want to punish the woman who has perpetrated this atrocity. The depths of her darkness are unfathomable. How can anyone be so hateful? For me, she embodies the very worst possible female. She wins the trust of the helpless, takes their finest gifts, and then imprisons them with their own permission under false pretenses. </p>

<p>In this dream, I see my shadow reflected in both the victim and the perpetrator. As the victim, I surrender what is best about me to a situation that feels confining at its best and suffocating at its worst. Fearing to expose the very worst in me, I stuff myself into a mold. Even though I cannot breathe, I attempt to keep my Self under control, at all personal costs. The vulnerability of my soul is the victim. As the perpetrator, I commit a most horrific crime of the heart. I convince myself that what I’m doing is a necessary evil. The wild side of me needs to be kept under lock and key. The perpetrator is my Judge, she who knows best. </p>

<p>In the dream, I sell my Self out. I take all my greatest gifts—all of my creativity, love and passion—and stuff them into a filthy, dark, dank barrel which presses in on me and stops everything but the faintest heart beat and shallowest breath. There I sentence my soul to solitary confinement until I can get my Self more in line with my persona. There I waiver, uncertain I can convince myself to keep breathing, where survival does not feel like a worthy choice. </p>

<p>By dancing these characters, I begin to understand why this particular dream came to me. My dream portrays two polar opposites. Perhaps this dream is trying to help me see both of these aspects of myself: the consenting, passive victim and the perpetrator of the crime, the judge. Dancing these dream characters is a very intense experience. This place is too painful for me to linger long. I move into the protagonist of my next dream. </p>

<h2>The Goddess</h2>

<p>The second dream that I explore in the dream dance portrays a very different image of a woman: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am outside in the country on a very sunny day. I’m standing with my legs in a strong, wide stance with my feet planted in the earth, my arms flung open wide, and my head tilted toward the sky. As a snake slithers between my feet, I startle awake.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream character is a Goddess, strong and receptive. Dancing this dream feels delightful! The arm movements open from the heart. My lower body is powerful and grounded. I breathe deeply as I explore this dream image. I look upward as my gestures extend away from my center toward the sky. I also release my body into gravity, sliding toward the floor. The snake brings the connection with the dark, hidden places of the earth. Rolling and pressing against the floor, I connect with this snake energy. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-2.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This dream dance experience did not end for me when my class was over. Instead, it highlights my need to further explore these dreams. I dance these dream images in the studio alone. I write about them. I draw the barrel and the Goddess. I narrate the dream dance for witnesses. I process the dreams with a Jungian analyst. I research the Snake Goddess. I compile visual art images that portray both the barrel nightmare and the sunlit dream. </p>

<p>My in-class exploration of this dream dance exercise has sparked the dance that I am currently creating for my dance company. In the process of describing recurring nightmare images and dancing those postures and places that haunt my dreams, I realized I had a dance that needed to unfold. After exploring these dreams further, I knew that I would entitle the dance, ‘Out of the Nightmare, Into the Light.’ The title provides a road map of the dance for me. I begin with the first anxiety-producing dream, take the audience through a full range of nightmare scenarios of oppression, and then move into the light of the Goddess, still grounded by the presence of the snake. The dance is not yet finished, but the process is exhilarating! </p>

    ns1:description """<p>In all the groups that I've participated in throughout my life, whether educational, political, artistic, professional and even ones based on mere conviviality, the undermining elements of factionalism, ego conflicts and various other differences have interfered with achieving a lasting sense of genuine conspiracy. Originating in the shadow sides of our psyches and hidden by our facile personas, these factors serve to discourage healthy and effective group functioning on many levels, in terms of achieving consensus, creating viable solutions to problems and gaining clarity of visionary goals/objectives for the group. </p>

<p>Why, in spite of sharing common interests, political, socioeconomic and humanitarian values, are we unconsciously antagonistic towards the groups we choose to be a part of? What kinds of subjective reluctance do we harbor in fully contributing ourselves to the group consciousness? James Hillman observes that, "the Self is the interiorization of community." Yet what exactly prevents us from reaching the Self, the ultimate core of the psyche and experiencing truly universal communion with others?</p>

<p>My experiences with persistent group dysfunction prompted me to develop a dreamwork technique which I call "Integrative Dream Narration" (IDN). I first tried IDN on a class of art students who, myself included, could not fully cooperate with one another in a way conducive to our spiritual, artistic and intellectual well being. I had each participant write a dream synopsis on a notecard, emphasizing the use of symbolic, transformative dreams concerning wholeness, i.e., getting in contact with the Self. I then combined the dreams to create a collective story which all could listen to and participate in, since each individual dream contributed to the cohesiveness of the narration. </p>

<p>The inherent fluidity of dreams became much more apparent, for I did not have to struggle to synthesize the dreams as they seemed to coalesce on their own accord, like tributaries flowing naturally into a river and then into the communal ocean. Instead of assuming the role of an improviser or story I was more like a mediator of the unconscious mind of the group. </p>

<p>When I finished the story, class members sat in peaceful silence. The narration had encouraged a shared consciousness amongst us. We all seemed to be open to one another and breathing together in the true sense or conspiracy. No one was prompted to speak right away. We all enjoyed this feeling of being fully present, instead of just pretending to be together under the guise of a shared interest. None of us, it seemed, needed to follow the impulses of our egos to rationalize and explain the experience away. During the rest of the class, we were able to come to a consensus as to how the remainder of the semester would be navigated and actually came up with a syllabus which all agreed upon. </p>

<p>I have since employed Integrative Dream Narration to enhance the integrity of many different collectives - from musical and spiritual to political - with very effective, though never predictable, results. Many of the resistances we have toward surrendering to a group consciousness - resistances deeply rooted in fear - loosen up and a newfound integrity is created. </p>

<p>The word, "Integrity" has its etymological meaning: "entire, untouched, unmarred, an original state." What has so thwarted the success of many different groups, I feel, has been the inability to recognize the sense of entirety and originality that is always present, if only subliminally. For example, the Australian Aborigines considered Alcheringa or Dreamtime to be the original state of the world prior to the arrival of human beings. Dreamtime was the world in its unmarred entirety (the Self). </p>

<p>IDN serves to facilitate a contact with the <em>primordial</em> community, encouraging an experience of interrelatedness that helps to diminish many anxieties and isolating/ alienating effects that are often deliberately promoted in consumerist societies. A holistic communication, both in speaking, listening and feeling, becomes possible once the collective dream matrix is brought into awareness and utilized, when it is substantially grounded in the body politic, so to speak. Since many illnesses- both the somatic and psychic- are induced and prolonged by blockages, encouraging the opening up of communicative channels on all levels allows mind, body and spirit to align themselves to a healing sensibility. This is true not only from within oneself but from within others as well. IDN influences and heightens one's awareness of shared experiences - of the subtle body - that are for the most part rooted in unconsciousness and remain unrecognized by most of us. Especially when we spend so much of our time maintaining our protective personas when amongst others and outside of the comfortable circle of our families and friends. </p>

<p>Dreams in themselves have a fluid, autonomous quality to them. We are constantly astonished by what our unconscious minds can create. The word <em>influence</em> has its origins in the word <em>fluid</em>. Directing the current of dreams towards communal integrity can greatly enhance the success and effectiveness of small group functioning and its influence upon our collective environment. The profound sense of inter-relatedness evoked by IDN has its basis in synchronicity, or the merging of outer and inner events to create meaning. To paraphrase it in Jungian terms, IDN evokes synchronicities as a result of the dreams being combined. On an intuitive level, awareness of synchronicity becomes heightened, in not only the narrator but the participants as well and it influences the direction the narration takes by sensing what is occurring when each individual integrates into the group dream dynamic. </p>

<p>The matrices within which synchronicities occur can be perceived and/or experienced, i.e., the psychic space which encompasses both inner and outer worlds in which so-called coincidences happen. Imagine the possibilities of creating atmospheres where synchronicities occur, like a lightening storm, through our combined dreams. </p>

<p>I once gave a demonstration of Integrative Dream Narration to a group of forty people. Six souls volunteered to participate and contributed their chosen dreams. One dream concerned a woman who was led by three angels to what she called a "Wellness Spa" but she didn't know how to run the place. Another woman dreamt that her grandmother was pregnant. One participant dreamt that her ex-boyfriend appeared and told her how sad he was that they were no longer together. </p>

<p>During the course of the unpremeditated narration, everyone arrived at the wellness spa where there was a fountain in the center. (I always emphasize communal places where all can gather). The grandmother gave painless, underwater birth to a golden baby. The baby was then handed to the woman who came to the fountain with her ex-boyfriend. I finished the narration, making sure all dreams offered were included in the story... and listened to enthusiastic comments from the participants and the audience. Afterwards, the woman who dreamt about her ex-boyfriend came up to me and confided, "I didn't want to say this in front of everyone but the reason that my boyfriend and I broke up is because I wanted to have a child."</p>

<p>As I proceeded with the narration, something in me or rather, in the Integrated Dream Community, intuited this and had the baby handed to the couple as some sort of reconciliation which I intuitively sensed was needed. The combination of these dreams created the matrix in which this synchronicity took place. As the narrator, my sense of individuality became less and less pronounced as all the dreams were combined. Perhaps synchronicities occur outside of the realm of the ego and it is only when we are not solely in this realm that we experience them. The synchronicities that occurred during the narration manifest also in bodily response, in both the narrator and participants. At first there is a considerable amount of tension, which is natural when strangers come together to form a group. The tension is usually born of the illusion of a sense of separateness among the participants. Breathing becomes restricted (the antitheses of conspiracy or breathing together). </p>

<p>But when all the dreams are integrated, the tension dissolves and what I sense as the collective heart, begins to beat and open up... the heart of understanding which transcends judgment, definition and ego centered identity. Interiorization of the communal heart in turn opens one's own heart, creating a reciprocal balance between self and group. As I proceed with the narration I feel blockages in my own body begin to open, for my body is but a microcosm of the collective dream macrocosm. I cannot emphasize enough that participants pay attention to their bodies during the narration. The results of opening are beneficial in allowing a person to respond to their own dreams in a way devoid of the usual anxieties born of trying to interpret (as opposed to integrating) the dreams.</p>

<p>Once an awareness of the relation between one's body and the integrated dream body is achieved, the next stage of the IDN dream work method is an interactive one, i.e., participants are asked to contribute to the narration, instead of just one person creating what happens. The interaction takes place not only in oral articulation of dreams but in working with imagery and movement as well, creating a foundation on which to base further involvement in collective dreamwork. In essence, a dream democracy is being created every time IDN is used. </p>

<p>Integrative Dreamwork has not only promising therapeutic potentials but most importantly political ones as well. The political dimension is tragically absent in many aspects of the New Age movement and it is time to act. Imagine integrating the dreams of a dysfunctional family to create a harmonious dream consciousness. Consider the long range benefits of integrating the dreams of the board members of major corporations with its employees. Or consider integrating the dreams of a republican with those of a democrat. The collective dream body created from such integrations could hold the key to long range solutions to some of our most immediate and seemingly irresolvable problems. Here are the guidelines for the technique or rather psychnique, as I call it: </p>

<h2>Integrative Dream Narration: The Process</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Have each participant (there should be no more than five or six) sit in a circle and pass around color coded notecards. Participants are instructed to write their dreams down, legibly, particularly ones that are highly symbolic and important to them. The dreams should not be read by other participants. A synopsis of the dream is adequate as long as a meaningful scene or symbol is included. Extended or complicated dreams do not work well. Always emphasize the inclusion of an important scene in the dream, if the dream itself is too long but the participant wants to contribute it. The dream narrator leaves the room. </p></li>
<li><p>The dream narrator enters the room, sits down and reviews the note cards that have been gathered by shuffling through them and imprinting images, sequences, even the tone of dreams in her/his memory. It is best for Dream Narrators to go through the cards two or three times. Writing down clues as to how the dreams could be connected on a separate sheet of paper is helpful in making sure all dreams are integrated. </p></li>
<li><p>The Dream Narrator initiates the Integrative Dream Narration by using one of her/his dreams, one that has been evoked by reviewing the notecards and/or a pre-chosen dream. Once a portion of the dream is conveyed, the narrator begins to integrate participants' dreams into the story. The narrator can pause and instructs the participants to pay attention to their bodies throughout the narration, i.e., changes in breathing, where they are holding tension, where they are relaxing. </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to ask if everyone's dream has been included before continuing. When all the participants dreams have been integrated, the narrator pauses and allows the participants to sense the integral presence of the collective dream matrix evoked by incorporating all dreams into the narration. The participants are instructed to begin breathing deeply for a few moments, noting where they may be holding tension in their bodies while encouraging them to let go of the tensions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Integrative Dream Narration is resumed and then brought to some 'completion', i.e. a sense of wholeness or resolve. The facilitator sounds out a color and the person whose notecard corresponds to that color shares with the group what dream she/he contributed. When all have shared their individual dreams, breath awareness is resumed. Instruct all participants to return to their bodies and become centered and separate.</p></li>
</ol>

    ns1:description """<p>The best news far in 1997 has been an invitation to write a column for <em>Dream Network</em>. I have chosen the title <em>Network Nous</em>, using the Ionian philosopher Anaxagoras's coinage for what he perceived as the universal mind. The scientist Itzhak Bentov in his book, <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em> calls it the Isoelectric field which surrounds the earth. The Jesuit Priest, Teilhard De Chardin used the Catholic modifier: Noosphere. Many other names from all dreams of life describe the phenomena of shared mind as well. It is poignantly embodied in what is called the Erur dream, which translated means 'circle dream' where the initiate dreams of putting his arms around the world with the fingers touching, an all embracing symbol of global knowledge. </p>

<p>In Vol. 13 #3 of Dream Network, I premiered with an article called <em>Integrative Dream Narration</em> which describes a psychnique I've devised where individual dreams are merged into a collective story to create a shared consciousness, an oneiric Nous of sorts. I have been researching dreams and dreamwork for 25 years and am currently writing a book called Dream Democracy where I express my belief that dreams are urging us on to a more substantially political involvement in life. Currently residing in Minneapolis, MN., I am a freelance writer, art critic, intuitive counselor and valet/ferryman at a nearby old folks home as well.</p>

<p>In Network Nous, we will be specifically exploring how dreams have assisted in furthering the betterment of humanity by offering up the seeds of discovery, which in turn inspire practical inventions, artistic creations, as well as spiritual and secular visions. In the Islamic tradition, dreamed ideas such as these are the result of 'Istikhara' which means 'asking a favor of heaven.' In Sufism they could be considered a form of 'tallaji' which indicates 'a breakthrough of the limitations of time and space'. Inventionary dreams assist us in breaking through outdated belief systems, dogmas and doctrines and other restrictive codicils. </p>

<p>Historical as well as contemporary examples of dreams will be included in this column. Exploration will be employed as an alternative to interpretation and analysis. It is my belief that inventionary dreams hold energy patterns (morphogenetic fields) that we can utilize and benefit from. For all dreams are interconnected in a kind of electrostatic field in the collective unconscious waiting to be reactivated and utilized. </p>

<p>From St. Augustine to August Kekule and his Benzene ring dream to St. Perpetua and Joan de Arc's dream of leading an army to victory, we will investigate creationary and inventionary dreams themselves in confidence that they will serve as a catalyst for furthering our current dreams into manifest reality. But first let us start in the 1600s, when most of our recent troubles began, troubles which have made it exceedingly difficult to break completely through the limitations of time and space. </p>

<p>One of the most ironic conceits in western philosophical history is that Rene Descartes, the infamous 17th Century French philosopher who helped spark the Enlightenment, formulated his doctrine of mind body dualism from a series of dreams he had. How he tried to permanently rend the mind from the body, making reason reign eternally supreme all the while using the wellsprings of the irrational as inspiration, is a most vexing and troublesome quandary. When one regards just how psychologically, environmentally and spiritually devastating such a rift has been, even in our holographic era, the paradox becomes even more troubling. Could Rene, with pineal idiosyncrasy, have misinterpreted the deeper import of the dreams themselves? Was he fearful of what the dreams were really trying to tell him? Could his philosophy of reason have been a cerebral career move, a panicky defense against what the dreams were really trying to urge him towards? See Karl Stern's book <em>Flight From Women</em>. He offers some viable interpretations of Descartes's dreams in an attempt to answer these questions. </p>

<p>Three hundred years later, a teenager dreamed of riding a sled so fast that the stars in the sky started to distort into fantastic shapes and beautiful colors. This dream led him to eventually develop a unified counterpoint (with a three century pause between the notes) to Cartesian doubt. Mr. Einstein's unconscious was merely counter pointing, if not counter-punning with a kind of relative resolution or retribution which would once again reunite mind, body, even soul into a unified field of dreams. I suspect dream fugues of this nature are occurring at all times around the world. Perhaps there are contemporary dreams answering to the echoes of paleolithic dreams in such a fashion. We simply need to dilate our dream awareness to embrace such synchronic and diachronic fugues. </p>

<p>Even after the Tallaji of Einstein and others, the Cartesian illusion still dictates much of how we conduct our lives. Our science and industry for-profit organizations still rely on mind-body dualism which is used in attempt to control our world, make us unhappy. The dubious reputation for abstraction (from the word abstrahere: to draw away from) institutions ranging from the National Rifle Association to the National Academy of the Sciences have could very well be counterpointed if dreams are included in papers written by scientists, researchers, underwriters, in patent applications, even W-2 forms! Not just written descriptions and compulsory interpretations but drawings and paintings of the symbols, locales and dream personae as well. Imagine Ph.D theses peppered with dream icons instead of bar graphs and charts! Or how about a scientist dancing a dream in front of the members of the National Academy of the Sciences. A doctor doing a dream cha-cha for the AMA? All these are near-fetched possibilities if we simply ask a favor of our dreams to reveal the inventions needed to bridge the rift.</p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> When I watch you dream tending, what fascinates me most is how you shape-shift; the manner in which you physically change your physical being as you listen to the dream. I have witnessed you seeing the image, sometimes when it is not even in the narrative of the dream. So, if you could speak to that magical ability, I think it would serve anyone attempting to work with dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Not magical, but imaginal. When I develop an image-centered relationship with the figures, by that I mean entering their world on their terms, images come to life, present themselves, say, “Here we are.” On the other hand, when or if we meet the dream for the purposes of interpreting or analyzing, then we’re going to bring our rational mind only into relationship with the material or content of the dream. At that moment, the visitation is lost, the actuality of its presence disappears. To witness the activity of a living image is a very different mode of perceiving and therefore a quality of relationship is needed. The “trick” is to meet the dream in the way of the dream. When I bring a dream-like consciousness to the dream then one thing happens, dreams come alive; and if I bring a rational, analytical mind for the purposes of interpreting the dream, then something else altogether takes place, dreams become static. It’s not that interpretation or analysis is bad, it’s just that my preference is to first let the dream come forward to show itself as its Self, as an embodied enactment; then, secondly, to bring my capacity for insight or analysis. I think that is what you are most likely noticing. It really is a different mode all together. It’s a mode of perception that is anchored in an imaginal consciousness rather than an exclusively logical, scientific mind. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How do you teach that or suggest that people wishing to get there begin the process?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> There are four core skills that I suggest experimenting with. One is curiosity. When we get curious, we get interested. Rather than jumping so quickly to what we think the dream means, we get curious and follow the activity of the images and the figures of the dream. Curiosity takes us to a very different place altogether. The second, along with curiosity, is a way of listening. One way of listening is to listen for the purposes of offering an answer. So, we’re already rehearsing what the answer or the response will be before we have even listened fully to what is being presented. When tending dreams, it’s a question of taking a deep breath, getting anchored, and becoming receptive and responsive: listening first and allowing the conversation to emerge out of the silence, rather than using our active mind to fill the space. Responsive listening is the second skill. The third is to really pay attention to detail or particularity. Rather than seeing each image as the same— for example, the elephant, or even the house as all being of one kind— noticing how each image comes with its particular distinction. When we view every house or creature or elephant or animal as the same we go into a kind of explanatory system and begin to categorize these images. On the other hand, if we notice that each house is different in its own details and that each animal or creature has its own particularity or uniqueness or oddity, then we slow down, take the time to watch and look and carefully notice its particular actuality. The fourth core skill is patience. In order for images to reveal who they are, we must slow down and be patient. With patience, images will reveal what they offer from the inside out. Working with these core skills we get interested in the “visitation” of the living images. We are asking the question, “Who is visiting now?” rather, than being hell bent on determining, “What does this mean?” Our insistence on “getting to the bottom of things,” and finding the “correct answer” or “meaning” renders the image lifeless. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That’s a lovely way of answering that question.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> It’s similar to the artistic process, I would imagine. When I watch you dance, for example, one way is to rehearse the steps and know the choreography; and that’s wonderful, helpful. Another way is to know the choreography and then in performance to allow something else to move through and fill the body. There’s a certain spontaneity that goes with the discipline. It makes all the difference. When you watch, some people fill the room with their resonant quality. They originate from a deeper source. Other people are moving through the action but you don’t have a sense of their depth of presence. And the same is true, I find, when working with a dream. When we work out of the deeper sources, something comes forward that otherwise would not. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What is your feeling about working with dream images to create poetry, haiku, or dance?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Well, I think that the psyche itself is poetic from the beginning. So, there’s a poetics of psychic reality; it’s not as linear or rational or literal as we might imagine. Rather, there’s a certain kind of poetry that’s always going on. After all, the dreams, when they come forward, aren’t in paragraphs or sentences. They present themselves in imagery, and often in story, gesture, or sound. A certain quality of metaphoric elaboration is already a part of the enactment. There’s a poetic quality from the beginning. To meet the poetic psyche in the way of a poem is very different than to meet it as a literary critic, for example. I think to appreciate that a poetic quality is already a part of the dream is to listen and allow the dream to live in its own rhythm, its own complexity, and its own intelligence. It’s just remarkable to imagine that every day there are a thousand images available to depict any particular dream motif. The dreaming psyche “chooses” a particular set of images and after creatively combining them, putting them together, a story comes forward that at first glance often makes no sense whatsoever to the rational mind. Yet, once you start listening with a poetic ear, something altogether different happens. It’s as if the poetry is already there presenting itself for those who have metaphoric ears to listen and aesthetic eyes to see. And like seeing through a looking glass, each dream is multi-leveled like a parable, commenting on circumstances of the day, on my life history, and on the archetypal themes that are running through it. In addition, it’s picking up on images or expressions from the world’s psyche or the world’s soul. All that’s happening and can only happen as a creative presentation. Otherwise, every dream would be two volumes of written narrative. Like a great painting, it captures us and opens us in multiple ways, which is what I think dreams are meant to do. They come forward and, when we tend them, rather than interpret or analyze; they engage our imagination. Like an extraordinary painting or a great piece of art or a remarkable piece of theatre or dance, dreams resonate with poetic depth. That which is to be revealed will become known if we allow ourselves to take a step back and allow them to work on us as much as we work on them. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> One phrase that has resonated with me for a long time that you often say is that “the body is always dreaming.” Long before I ever started studying dreamwork, I was using dance as a way of working with my dreams, not to analyze or necessarily even understand, but to make the image alive for me. I just want to hear how you are now with the idea that “the body is always dreaming.”  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I have a couple of ideas about that. As I have suggested, I don’t think dreams originate in our rational mind. They originate from a deeper source. One such source is the body. When we experience an upset stomach, or a place in our back where we’re feeling tight, or the onset of a cold or flu, or more seriously, something like a cancerous growth, the dreaming psyche is going to pick up those symptoms and most likely present them in the imagery of dreams. On that level, the body is always dreaming. So, when we listen to dreams, we are always listening to the body talk about itself in one way or the next. On another dimension, images themselves come with body. They are alive and active and they walk about. They breathe and have presence and pulse. They certainly are not incarnate like our bodies, but in an imaginal context—in the world of dream—they’re very interactive and very embodied. In that context embodied images have emotion or feeling. It’s not only we who have emotions in response to the image. Images will come with emotions to begin with and then in turn create an affect inside of us. It’s simply a different way of appreciating dream and it’s not esoteric. It’s very “just so.” When we take the time to listen to dream or to watch the actuality of the dream presentation, we see images walking about affecting one another—one figure impacting another figure. Embodied images are filled with emotions and feelings; and they tend to evoke our response. We then can allow our bodies to move with gesture or even with dance to greet the image. In a curious way, in those moments we are interpreting the dream—not through words or through our mind-—but through our bodies. We’re meeting the image body of the dream with our bodies. That kind of interaction I find quite important and useful. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How about those dreams in which—not people—but animals are communicating with us?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Our tendency is to interpret the animal or capture it or dissect it like you would a butterfly; put it in the case and label it. The animal means an in-law or the animal means an aggressive creature like a boss that’s overly aggressive or it may be a partner who is overbearing. Our tendency is to attribute personal characteristics to the creatures. There’s probably some value to that, actually. In addition, though, the animal has its own reality, its own autonomy, its own independence, and its own presence. In all the stories when we follow the animal something out of the ordinary is bound happen. When the creature comes and you follow, we find our way “back to Kansas.” When ET comes, something “out of this world” reveals itself. Animals forever take us on a journey, are important guides through unknown terrain, or serve as important teachers. Sometimes they even come to us as ancestral spirits. So, I always suggest taking great care to listen to the intelligence that lives in the animal and taking the time to follow the animal. If you follow the animal, something unexpected tends to show up. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You have a book coming out quite soon.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yes, in the first part of next year. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What can you tell us about it?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> The book is called Dream Tending, and it documents the approach that I use with dreams. It is woven around a personal story. There are some personal reflections about my experience and my relationship to dream and how it has affected my own life. There are many teaching points. So, it covers the primary ideas that anchor Dream Tending. It talks about the concept of the “living image.” The book has a full chapter about tending nightmares. It has a section about tending images as medicines for work with physiological aliments and illness. Part of the book describes in detail Dream Council, which is a way of sustaining relationship in a long-term way with dreams. And too, the book talks about the World’s Dream, an eco-psychological approach to dream work. In addition to the teaching points, there is an experiential component, so that people who are reading the book will have an opportunity to work with their dreams. There are particular exercises or methods that are presented—tools that are embedded all throughout the text that will help people work with their dreams and have an actual experience of what tending to a dream is and how that is different than simply interpreting or analyzing a dream. When tending a dream, there is an immediate correspondence to the challenges presented by daily life. In fact, in the book I have a section on the practical applications of working with dreams. I offer skills, elaborations, and case examples of working with dreams in the workplace, in intimate love relationships, in relation to money, and vocation. So, there are a lot of practical applications of how to work with this material in relationship to issues of everyday life. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How does the book play into the huge following of people who have taken the Dream Tending classes and those who are interested but haven’t yet participated?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> The challenge of the book is to do two things. One is to really put a lot of what I’ve been working on for now over thirty years in one place, so that people will have a foundational text or a touchstone out of which to continue and sustain their practice of dream tending. To work with dream, to tend dream, is a life practice as much as it is a therapy. It’s a way of being in the world, oriented and anchored in dream, in a relationship to dream. So on one hand, I think it is going to be very helpful and useful for those who have worked with me and worked with the art. In addition, the book is written in such a way that a person who has never been acquainted with my work or has never worked with dream will have an opportunity to move through the book gradually and find the methods and the tools that they might find useful in developing a relationship with a dream. So, it’s really working on two different dimensions at the same time. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You also have a DVD out now. My experience of it is that it is very beautiful.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yes. There’s a DVD—about an hour long—and that’s about the Dream Tending method and it depicts it in visual form. Then, there’s a CD series through Sounds True that’s just been reissued. It’s a six CD set on Dream Tending that provides the methods and the tools and examples and it’s in narrative. So, between the movie and the CDs and now the book, there should be a lot of information as to how to work with dream from this point of view. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Where do you think your work will take you now that you have this concrete piece of it complete?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I’m doing a couple of things that I find most exciting. I’m working with at risk teenagers, actually, working with dream and working with this approach to dream; working with kids that have been in and out of jail and having a hard time with drugs, school, or a really difficult time in family life. Many of them are coming from juvenile hall, so you would not think that dreams would be the medium that would be useful. It is surprising, and quite frankly, deeply satisfying to work with a group of 20 or 30 teenagers in each session who are pretty hardcore by any of our standards; and yet, you introduce image or you introduce the idea of dream and imagination gets ignited and we’re talking story and all kinds of things start coming forward. The liberation to engage the most tortuous of feelings and life circumstances is remarkable. We are in deep conversation for hours on end. So, I’m very interested in doing more of that. I’m also working with a project of the United Nations, working with dreams in relationship to international environmental policy formation. Bringing dream work to this initiative, the development of an Earth Charter, is instructive because with dream we start at the place that honors multiple perspectives. As we know, embedded in the imagery of dreams many points of view present themselves from the get-go. Dreams are an under utilized resource and a little known source of intelligence in the world of diplomacy. We get so fixed in our positions; and yet, when dream or image or story comes forward, we’re placed, at once, in imagination and we’re looking at things from many different angles. So, I’ve introduced dreamwork into a number of forums now: working with the policy development and also working with leaderships groups at this level. What’s been gratifying for me is bringing groups of people together that otherwise would be in conflict. I have found that dreams are a way into what lives at the core of our humanity. When dream work comes into the room so does compassion, understanding, empathy, and a willingness to work through our differences and find common ground. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> One question that was offered by the editor of Dream Network Journal was any relationship you might find between the dream and the political environment right now as we approach the election.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I was just in Europe and talking about the current presidential election. I was offering lectures from a depth psychological perspective about Americans’ reaction to the war in the Middle East. I was talking about this in relation to dream. What came back from audience after audience was a powerful response to the political dialogue unfolding in the United States. The power of the imagery is vivid and vital. The interest, the curiosity, more importantly, the passion that gets constellated around what is happening in this country is being experienced as nothing less than a revolution of thought and mind. What is being sparked is way bigger than what most Americans can imagine at the moment. And of course, that has to do with the Obama phenomenon and the presidential election. People are responding strongly overseas, just as they are in this country. I suspect it is similar to what happened when the presence of Lincoln or FDR or even for that brief moment Kennedy was at work in the imagination. What’s being evoked is a revolutionary impulse. Folks were not telling me that they were seeing Obama or McCain as literal figures in their dreams, but I have picked up, again and again, a certain kind of rising tide of passion. I’m not sure it’s linked only to this particular election. It’s linked to something else that is operating in the Zeitgeist at the moment. On the one hand, there are images of liberation appearing more frequently in dreams. On the other hand, images of grief are also making their presence known. I think they go hand-in-hand. I think the new news is that in the United States, in our psychology, collectively, there tends to be a lot of grief that’s coming forward as well as the more obvious enthusiasm. Of course, the dream images of grief can be attributed to the war that seems to be never ending, to environmental concerns like global warming, or to the worries about the impending economic recession/depression, but it seems much deeper than that. It seems as if, in a curious way, in the psyche of Americans, there’s a grief over the Empire itself. We’re coming to terms with the idea that we are not any longer Number One on the planet. That fall from grace, the idea that other countries, other nations, are emerging, and we, as the dominant empire, are on the wane; there’s a kind of grief that comes from that. It creates a kind of numbness or a kind of denial. And, of course, when not fully conscious, then the dreaming psyche will pick that up. What I’m experiencing is not only dreams of liberation and other corresponding images of hope and desire that Europeans and Asians are having about America, but here in the United States, I am seeing a lot of imagery that depicts grief, dying and death. Our first response is to literalize these images. A figure dies in the dream and we imagine an aspect of our personality that’s dying or somebody in our world is in ill health or we’re dreaming of our own mortality. I think, collectively however, that there is something going on in the Deep Psyche that knows somehow that the global dominance of the American Empire is coming to an end. That’s what I would say. I think the Obama phenomenon, in some ways, is a response to that grief. I think that the political dreams of our day have as much to do with the process of dying as they do with the desire for change. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What else would you like to share? What have we not touched?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> About 30 years ago, when I first started working with dreams, dreaming was very popular. Working with dreams was a popular phenomenon. I think it started all those years back with Carlos Castaneda and lucid dreaming, going back years now. There was a kind of curiosity in the interest of dreams. It was all the rage. Dream books were selling as soon as they hit the shelves. The field of Depth Psychology was coming forward through the Human Potential Movement. The work of Jung was beginning to take hold in this country and other places. The mythology of Joseph Campbell became popular. There was a kind of move toward imagination and dream. Over the last ten or fifteen years, much of the popular interest vanished. People were not as interested. But in the last year or so, there seems to be a resurgence of fascination in dreaming and in the imagination in general. The imaginative processes are again capturing the curiosity of so many people. Everywhere from Oprah to late night radio, we’re beginning to hear people talk about dream and getting interested in dream. As I travel around the country, workshops are much more highly attended. So, I think there is a renaissance of interest at the moment. What I advocate is that people get into small dream groups. I know that for a long time that was frowned upon and people thought it was best only to work with dream one-on-one. But now, more than ever, I think there’s a kind of a call back to the earlier times in human experience where people gathered together in small groups and talked story and talked dream. We all don’t need to be psychoanalysts or trained therapists. It’s just okay to sit and tell about our dreams, to let the dreams get to know one another. The fear is that we are going to hurt each other; we’re going to get overly psychological. But if we don’t intrude or we don’t impose or we don’t leverage dream, we can just simply listen to each other’s stories. People have been doing that for thousands and thousands of years. I think it’s a way of making contact. It’s a way of accessing imagination. It’s a way of guarding against the era of too much programmed information and too many video screens. When I watch my kids and others kids, they’re in screen time so much of the time that they (we) lose contact with the spontaneous imaginative process that is indigenous to each of us. If nothing else, talking dream opens up story and evokes imagination. I think it’s a wonderful thing to see the return of an interest in dreams and a return to an engagement with the dreaming psyche. ∞ </p>

<p><em>Jeanne Schul Elkins interviews Barry Williams at the Journey into Wholeness conference. (Part II of this interview appears in Volume 25 No. 3)</em></p>

<p><em>Barry Williams, M.Div., Psy.D., a Jungian analyst in private practice in Taos NM and Evanston IL, has had extensive experience in wilderness pursuits and experiential education, including eight years teaching with Outward Bound. He has a major interest in ritual forms that express the psyche’s participation in the archetypal wholeness which nature represents. He has been one of the leaders of the Temagami Vision Quest in Canada for 14 years.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne Elkins:</strong> Barry, one of the things you do is dream gathering. Could you talk about that? </p>

<p><strong>Barry Williams:</strong> Well, Jean, the idea of dream gathering came to me from something I’d seen done at an international conference. People would gather early in the morning to share dreams and sit in a spiral. What we’ve brought here is the idea that if we pay attention to the dreaming process of the community, that we’re creating a container that contains the unconscious. It ritually contains the unconscious process of the community even though we’re just doing a fragment, perhaps one-tenth of the people participating, each day. This is holographic. It suggests the whole. There is a perception ritually that this material has a place to go, and thus is not running amuck through projections in the community. It is as if the unconscious in the community feels that it is being heard. When the gathering of the dreams is without any commentary, or with only a sentence of commentary to locate the meaning of the dream, the community has the experience of being listened to deeply. I act as the ritual elder figure, the one figure who is receiving, holding and understanding this material, even if I don’t in fact understand the dream. Ritually it’s the experience of being understood. It’s part of what we’re trying to accomplish in the whole conference: a complete ceremonial cycle. To assure psyche is being listened to deeply. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Could you talk a little bit about that position you hold as ritual elder? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> I’m more of a ceremonial leader in a way, though I am not leading anything, exactly. There is a sense that someone has a foot in both worlds: in the waking, conference, relating, interpersonal world, and also a foot firmly in the dreaming unconscious, wild, natural world. A ritual elder is a bridging figure, someone who bridges between the gods and the mortal world, and someone who can travel back and forth between them. So listening to the dream, the message from the other world, and speaking to the dreamer in the same moment, connects the worlds together. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You also hold that space and talk about a safe container, and it’s felt by those of us in the room. Can you help us understand about how you create that safe container? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> That’s a mystery, really. The idea is that I cannot do anything. My biggest contribution to a community like this is to try to create a container that is strong and safe enough so that the archetypal energies can constellate within the group. If the container is held correctly, there can be the possibility of some transformation, of healing, or of people getting across thresholds in their lives. The dreams can emerge in an ever greater way, perhaps. The container is built on trust and understanding and the community feels it. The more we establish trust, the more the community feels it and the stronger the container. The stronger the container, the more trust, until we can be a community that’s sharing its deepest truth. That’s an extraordinary event. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Can you help us identify archetypal energy in our dream work? Sometimes you give feedback to the dreamer that you need to either pay attention to your dream or die. What are the red flags? Should we as the dreamers see the red flag ourselves? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What I often say about dreams is that they exist on multiple levels at once. There’s the very personal, the historical, familial, the social, cultural, and what we’re calling archetypal: the realm of the gods. In the dream groups, what I’m striving for is not to have a therapeutic result, but that the healing potential in these groups will come from paying attention— not exclusively—to the archetypal ground of the dream. My feeling in this kind of work and dream-focused community is that we can have lived a moment of the experience of the ‘Great Mind.’ This is what I often call the mind of Nature itself (referred to in many ways in dreaming: the mind of the dream, the dreammaker, the Self, God). I prefer to call it the Mind of Nature, because it is that which is completely natural in its totality which is communicating through or to us—that is rising to consciousness. I like to pay attention to trying to get us to have the lived moment of the experience of that mind which is pure meaning, because it’s really the totality of things as it tries to come into the human realm. If we do not pay attention to it, we cannot live. When I use dramatic language like, “get this, or it will kill you,” it’s not that dreams can kill, but if we do not hear this voice, we cannot live. By living, of course, I mean we’re not living our complete lives. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Often in dreams, animals manifest. Yesterday in the dream group work, the images of snakes and eggs showed up. Can you help us understand where we should go when we have animals appearing in our dreams? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> I think that the biggest mistake people can make, and often do make these days, is running to their animal symbol dictionary. I often counsel people to throw these dictionaries out. The best thing you can do to amplify the meaning of something is to understand what it is that this thing does. If we want to know about snakes, we need to think about snakes. What are snakes? How do they live? Where do they come from? What do they eat? What do they do in the seasons? etc. An indigenous person looks at an animal and knows everything about it: knows how it is, what it looks like, what it does every day of the year. The second thing to do is to understand any personal encounters. Maybe this person was bitten by a snake in childhood or had a traumatic encounter, or their mother was afraid of snakes. That would be crucial to know. Only then go to the cultural stories, and only then try to understand about meaning conceptually. If you read in the symbol dictionary that snake has qualities of this and that, then you’re starting to think about it. The snake or the animal in the dream, like the dream itself, has to have a kind of living presence in the discussion. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> So you’re approaching it from a much more intuitive level than an analytical level? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes. That’s one of my favorite topics, thank you. My thoughts about dreams are not so much that we bring our considerable intellectual tools to a dream to use them to amplify what we’re seeing or what we know. The idea is not to bring it out of its realm like an animal out of the wild into the zoo, but also to allow ourselves to be drawn into its reality. That’s why I’m talking about the living presence of the meaning field of the dream. This field is not intellectually experienced. It’s almost like we’re the problem the dream is trying to solve. Of course that’s just the opposite from the way most people think about it: that the dream is presenting us this cryptic puzzle that we need to dissect and understand. You can do that, certainly, but usually that understanding only goes so deep. We waste the opportunity of a dream remembered if we only use it to try and understand our own lives, really, because there’s that other quality to it: that the dream is a living being, virtually. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> So when you’re working on a dream, are you seeing it as images? Is it a being? Is it an image? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What I‘m looking for when I work on a dream is a subjective experience within me. I cannot teach a methodology about dream interpretation, I can only teach an attitude towards it, out of which would come a certain kind of methodology. If you teach a methodology, then you’re just getting a kind of cookie cutter assembly line. If you have the proper attitude, then the approach to the dream is quite different. What I look for in myself is an experience of an unfolding, that the meaning of it begins to rise up like the mist. It goes from static to alive. It’s possible this is my own ‘way,’ but it’s something that I can just feel. I feel it in every cell, the rightness and the meaningfulness of it. This is dangerously close to imposing my interpretation on the dream, but I try not to do that. I try to bring it out and let it be alive between us. When it’s alive between us, then we can watch and comment and not impose an interpretation. When you can feel that it’s alive and functioning— that you’re in the story, the dream has gripped hold of you—then the story comes alive in its meaningfulness. Meaning is always related to the energies of the Self. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> A lot of people dream about sex. One of the agendas that came up in the group dreamwork was a statement you made: Often in dreams, sex isn’t about sex, it’s about the life-force. Can you help us understand that? (mutual laughter) </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What else do you say? Sex of course is a frequent motif in dreams, but in my experience, it’s rarely anything to do with sex, sexuality, or with genital sexuality. What is the purpose of genital sexuality? In human beings, of course, it is for the purpose of life. From the psyche’s point of view, that’s essentially the intention. New life, of course, is not a child. It’s the energies of two opposites brought together to make the whole that generates new life. This happens between individuals, and it also happens within the individual. When we’re dreaming of that the classic <em>conjunctio</em>, it is for the purpose of all possible kinds of new life and soul emergence. The classic example, of course, is a man dreams of a very seductive woman who is not his wife. In the dream he thinks, “I can’t do this, because this isn’t my wife.” This is all very well and good in outer life, but what is he neglecting to connect with in his inner life? There’s this thought that it’s not okay to do this because we have this thing called monogamy. From the psyche’s point of view, there’s an energy that needs to be addressed or that is addressing him, and it’s nothing to do with sex. It’s to do with the life-force itself. That is what really wants to be activated, to be expressed, to find a channel, to find a union, and wants to result in creation. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Along those lines, money is another issue that shows up. Your statement was, “Money is not about dollars.” </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Money is never about dollars in dreams. The dream doesn’t care how well off we are in life, it only cares about how much energy, how much “where-with-all” we have. Money dreams are more often images of the life force, libido, flow, fire, of spirit. Can we be a player in life? It’s not about consuming and purchasing and paying the bills. It’s about what we have available to us. The psychic world is about reciprocity and not about capitalism. Can we pay our way? Do we have enough? Are we impoverished? In other words, do we have enough to make the world happen around us and pay our way reciprocally with the other world? </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You often use the expression that the dreams are dreaming us. That’s thick. </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> That’s a hard one. Well, Many, many people have the experience—at least occasionally, or once in their lives—of being the one who is moved. Sometimes in meditation, people will have the experience of being breathed. I have a friend who is a runner who says that something is running him. It really is the presence of the Self. One of the great notions in working with the unconscious is the experience of what Jung calls the relativization of the ego. The ego, the individual, suddenly experiences that s/he is not the master in her/his own house. You’re living in someone else’s house and that you are the moved to the mover. You would never say, “I created this dream,” or “This is my dream.” I/you/ego could not have created any dream in a million years. It’s impossible. It’s this great mind—or all of nature, the gods themselves—who are thinking and creating in this way. This is the way the Self thinks. We are the creation of this thought process. Most people think that you do something and then you dream about it. Sometimes it appears that way chronologically, but it’s probably the other way around. What we’re doing is what we’ve already dreamed or what is dreaming us. What we call our waking reality is the infinite variables of life coming together like the weather—virtually—in a single moment of what we’re calling reality, which is totally over-determined by the unconscious process. So in that way we are dreamed into being. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You often warn us that when we are about to tell a dream, we are going to be telling everyone what we know least about ourselves. </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, dreams emerge from the unconscious. I always love the anecdote about Jung when he says apparently in some frustration, “You have to remember that what’s unconscious is unconscious.” In other words, it’s unknown. There’s only a small bit of the personal unconscious that we can actually make conscious. The rest is unconscious. It’s unknowable. When a person has a dream, it’s the unknown that is emerging toward consciousness. A nice point about dreaming is that by the time you’re dreaming of something, it’s well on its way to consciousness. It’s when you’re not dreaming of it that it’s running you unconsciously. If you’re dreaming about it, it’s on its way towards consciousness and that’s when you can bring it out and learn a little bit. So if a person tells a dream in a group, by definition he or she is saying what they don’t know about themselves. Thus it’s a very fragile offering and needs to be respected as such. That’s why I caution people that it’s not hunting season—it’s not open season on the dreamer. They’re not fair game for your projections, because it’s a very delicate, fragile, vulnerable place in which they’ve put themselves. They’re offering something that’s unique and beautiful which deserves and needs to be deeply respected. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Barry, can you talk a bit about your process of working with dreams in your professional practice? BW. Rather than me being the guide of the process, I’m letting the unconscious, the dreams, largely be the guide in terms of what we discuss. All the great motifs will be there. Over a long period of time, if the person can be related to this magnificent fabric of meaning that contains their personal lives—and at the same time displays all of the wonders of heaven, as it were—then this lends tremendous dignity and depth. That’s where the healing can come from. Jung was very clear on that. So in other words, when the archetypal worlds manifest through the dreams—and I believe that’s the way a person can connect with it—then the emotional result around that is healing. It’s the emotion that one experiences in the body that infuses the person, the whole selfhood of the person, with the transpersonal energies of the archetypal world. When that happens, each in its unique way, then lives can be changed. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Can you talk to us about those dreams that are so visceral that we wake up feeling physically the person we were carrying or where our hand just was… a kind of belief that it really did happen? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> It really did just happen. (laughter) </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Those are the dreams that we’re drawn into deeply. The attempt of the dreamer upon waking is often to get away from that. “Let me separate from that reality.” But the point is that the dream had you.... it was having you, as if it put you to sleep to have you. In some of those moments, you’re completely enmeshed in the reality of that world and it’s hard to return or to move out into ordinary consciousness again, because the energy of the meaning of the dream, for whatever reason, is extremely strong at that point. It’s really got you. It’s hooked you. These are special dreams. They are the ones that leave trails behind them in your life and are to be respected and given full attention. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Where does one go with those dreams other than to an analyst? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> It’s a great question. To an analyst, of course. The analyst is not only the one who can try to help you understand these things, but then also becomes a kind of initiating elder. When great dreams announce the journey you’re undertaking, you need to have a guide, because it’s an initiatory journey. Initiation is an archetypal pattern that always requires a death through an ordeal and a rebirth of some sort. Of course lots of people analytically think, “Give me the rebirth. Give me the new life. I can’t wait,” and they forget that there’s a death required, which is often, if not always, excruciating. Death is death. It’s hard to let go of an old pattern, an old identity, an old history, the old drama, the old story, the old way of being, or the old vocabulary. It is very humbling because you can see how the psyche is trying, in the absence of a cultural initiation pattern, to initiate the dreaming person. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Do you see a pattern with time of life, with people who come to see you when these kinds of dreams erupt? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> One of my favorite things in the last couple of years is to work with some young men and women who have gone to northern Hudson Bay on expeditions to encounter the Grandfather of the North. This is the place in many traditions where dreams come from and a great place of wisdom. I sit with them on their last campsite and listen to their dreams. This is a lost age group. They’re leaving adolescence and trying to emerge into young adulthood. The educational system and the government, the family and the culture—everybody is saying something—but what is the real pathway to the authentic life? A lot of people lose their way at this point. They decide to do something that seems okay, but it might not be well supported from the unconscious, and they will burn out at some point. I liken it to this: in the Pueblo world of the southwest, when the masked gods or the dancers enter the plaza (because these are archetypal figures... they’re not human beings any more) the ritual leader of the ceremony lays down a pathway on the ground for them, often of corn pollen or cornmeal, to walk on. I think youngsters’ dreams are like that. These are like the pollen pathways for them. If they can hear them, the dreams will open the pathway into their lives. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> There seems to be a lack of any form of initiation at any change of life in our culture. I’m wondering if dreams... </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> The answer if yes! Absolutely. Absent a cultural container for these rights of passage, it’s up to the psyche, really, to do it. Good ritual is about aligning the individual psyche with Nature and the Nature’s way. When these are aligned, then you’re doing something, often culturally... as it was in the beginning. The way it was in the beginning is the pure way of the psyche. If we no longer have this, and what’s worse, if we’ve lost our access to it, the psyche will still be going ahead with its attempts at alignment. It can feel crazy-making. If a person were part of a group that had done an initiatory process at an age-appropriate time, it would be a tremendous experience. When they’re doing it by themselves in the midst of a social environment that doesn’t support it, it can be quite difficult. You can see vestiges of rituals gone terribly awry in the acting out behavior of adolescents, gangs and so forth. The point is, in the classic initiatory pattern the ordeal is for the purpose of moving out of the old place and getting into a place where you can be connected to what we’ll call the archetypal realm. If we don’t do that in our lives, if we have lost the connection to the source-place of that realm, then we don’t know how to live. We get lost. In the Plains culture, a person without a vision is not a human being. They’re just people living their lives, but they’re not a real human being. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Do we have permission to not necessarily understand our dreams as long as we sit with it or go back to it? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> At the very least, pay attention. Acknowledge that the dream world does exist, that it is communicating with you. Write your dreams down You can draw them, paint them, sculpt them, dance them, do active imagination with them, sit with them, meditate on them. Just let them infuse you—even if you don’t understand them—because it’s usually not something you can get with your mind, in so many words anyway. At the very least, live with the knowledge that this process is going on. One of the techniques I use is to imagine we’re camped by a great river and it’s flowing by all the time, day and night, day after day, year after year, millennia upon millennia. From time to time we go down and dip our cup into it and drink from it, or use it to cook our meals, or bathe in it, or take and use the water for our crops. It’s only from time to time we go to the river; meanwhile it is powerfully flowing by... all the time. ℘</p>

<p><em>Jeanne Schul Elkins interviews Barry Williams at the Journey into Wholeness conference. (Part I of this interview appeared in Volume 24 No. 1)</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Can you give us some insight into the spiritual practice in which you participate and maybe an idea of how you deal with your own dreams?</p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I’ve kept a dream journal since 1970 and I don’t think I got into analysis until much later than that. Just the mere writing down of dreams is its own discipline, because then that world is being noticed, held, recorded, reflected on. There’s a great phrase: “The face you turn towards the unconscious is the face that it turns towards you.” So, if you’re turning towards it with respect, curiosity, in an invocational way, it will respond. It’s like any relationship; if you don’t call the person up, you won’t get to know them. They won’t pick up the phone. Or if you call and don’t say anything, they’ll just hang up. So it’s in the writing it down. I write down my dreams, of course, when I have them. I keep journals, a bookshelf full of them, and will really reflect on them. In my own life, I’ve had an interesting situation in my family some years ago that the medical world didn’t seem to be able to address. I really felt I had to put my money where my mouth was; dreams really help us through this. In fact, the dreams were more than helpful in finding the meaning and the purpose of the great dream of the birth of this child. In fact, it gave me my life. Had that not happened and had I not followed the dream—the inner understanding of this—I would have missed its meaning, as if the whole experience was the great dream. Even before the child was born, we had any number of very, very powerful dreams, which we were only able to decipher many years later, but that fell into a very visible pattern once we got it. So if I had not been true to myself and to my discipline, so to speak, I would have missed what was trying to, like a great dream, come into being. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Could you talk about the issue of voices in our dreams? What’s going on when we hear a very distinct voice in our dreams as we awaken? </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well, the dream thinks in images. We can’t think about a dream easily because the dream thinks in a different paradigm. So if a dream is thinking in images, then as something comes closer to consciousness, it might be personified, that something that is unimaginable takes on an imaginal quality as, say, snake, deer, horse, dog, monkey, human, in a kind of progression; and as it moves closer to consciousness, it becomes more and more personified. So a voice would be a message that—in order to be received—has to be put into, not a personified image, but a voiced image, as it were. So the meaning takes on a voice, and literally becomes the message. Not all dreams are images, of course. You can have dreams of kinesthetic senses. Sometimes people have tastes. In one of the most beautiful dreams I ever heard, the dreamer woke up with a taste of honey. Imagine. All of nature goes into this dream. Where does honey come from? It’s the transformed pollen. What is pollen? Pollen is the great, secret, growing world. It’s like the distilled essence of all of life was on the tongue of the dreamer. And, so, that’s hardly an image. It was a literal taste. Sometimes it’s a sound, sometimes a smell, sometimes a touch, sometimes, a voice.</p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Considering typology, an idea that really strikes me is the concept that we connect with the Divine or the Self through our interior function. In some dreams, I wake up and feel sensations sometimes as terrifyingly real. I often wonder why I don’t hear other people talking about feeling or smelling or experiencing the dream’s embrace as though it actually just happened. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well, what’s unconscious is unconscious. So, that’s an example of the dream coming through your least differentiated awareness. Even though you’re a dancer and you use your body and have quite a kinesthetic feel for life, apparently. Nevertheless, the dream comes through your inferior function, in the example you just gave. And so it would give you that sense of distance and incomprehension. But an immediacy, like: “Woo, this is what I really don’t know” and probably has a purposefulness in that. It gets your attention. You would never say, “Oh, I get that. It’s my usual mode.” You say, “Oh my God, this is so distant from me. How do I possibly understand it?” And that’s how you have to go work on it. It’s the portal to the unconscious world. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I understand it intellectually, but it is my experience that intuition is not supported by the world in which we live and is often discounted; as in, “It’s just a dream.” I’m confused about how we can go about living into the dream. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> One of the great problems for people is (and almost everyone asks this): “What do I do with this dream?” My advice is always, “We’re doing it.” It’s by talking about it. It’s by deepening into it. It’s by feeling it, letting it work us. That’s the process. We always think we want or we should bring the dream out into our lives and change our behavior and make ourselves a better person because of it. I don’t know if that’s wrong, or even misguided, but I’m never sure that that’s very helpful. Because there’s an inner process that’s going on and it’s our job to relate to that—to relate our lives to the inner process—not to bring the inner process out to make ourselves better people necessarily. Of course, so saying, you can always think of examples of dreams that give you a heads up. “You’re living in the wrong way.” Or “Pay attention to this or that.” Or “You don’t realize how much you love your child.” You can have a kind of Scrooge on Christmas morning experience through that and you sort of get it all in one night. In general, it’s the deep process that you’re trying to relate to. Again, not that we should bring that out into our waking world to have it, but to <em>allow ourselves to be had by it</em>, so that we’re aligning and attuning to it in some way. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The way that I came to dreamwork was literally waking up with horrific nightmares that were screaming for my attention. When I was completely electrified in the middle of the night, my response was to dive out of bed, retreat to my study, curl up with my journal, and write it down. My thirty years of journaling truly served me well. I needed to do something with all of those images. I couldn’t just make them go away. They were very visceral. I was feeling the dream in every part of my body. I think it’s that kind of urgency that, for some of us, makes dreaming suddenly significant. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> The word “suddenly” is very important. In fairy tales, often there will be a situation in which everything is just fine. There is the mother and the two wonderful daughters. Everybody loves everybody and the world loves them. “Suddenly” there is a knock at the door. There is the inbreaking of the conscious situation that needs to unfold itself in the life that these people need to pay attention to. Even the use of the word is like that knock on the door. “Suddenly” you need to pay attention to this in a big way. The dreams have this tremendous energy, tremendous valiancy to them, and you cannot do anything except open that door. What good does it do you to hide? Right? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes. It’s not possible. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> But it’s unthinkable to open the door. It’s way too much. And so there you are. You’re caught in this kind of existential moment of: “Damned if you do. Damned if you don’t.” But, in fact, you’re probably damned if you don’t and blessed if you do. In the fairy tales, almost always, when that in-breaking happens, it’s: “Suddenly” something happens. It’s the use of that word. It’s not “and then something happens.” This can be in the nature of a calling, too. Naturally, we get the word vocation from <em>vocare</em>, meaning to call. Many dreams that happen in the way you are describing are a kind of calling. It’s calling you to your life, really. Not away from your life, but calling you to your life, to your deep life: to be who you most inwardly are. That can be wrenching, if you’re not being very close to who you inwardly are. However, that’s the initiatory function. Classic vocational dreams can be quite dramatic: getting knocked off your horse on the way to Damascus and everything in between. It’s when the Self or God is calling to you. You can hear it as a voice. You can experience it as a traumatic dream. Ideally, our vocation in life is our calling from the Self. Again, it’s the image of alignment with that path wherever it should take you: down to purgatory or hell ala Dante. Still, that’s the path to life led through hell: to go deeply into what it is that is happening to you, as a result of who you are and what you’ve experienced and the psychological patterns that are dreaming you or having you, that want you — in a way — in a manner of speaking.</p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I‘ve certainly had dreams in which images or ideas or words showed up that I didn’t have a handle on, that seemed to hold a much bigger presence. Once, I dreamed of being at the Oracle of Delphi. I bowed to the Oracle and asked: “What is my path?” And the voice echoed back: “She who dances us into being.” </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> And what’s your experience of that? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It scares the hell out of me. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> So there’s some awe? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> A great deal of awe. It’s shocking, actually. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What is shocking about it? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I think it’s the closeness to divine presence or energy. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> The Great Life. The great reality of that world encounters you. One of the great religious experiences is of being addressed by “Otherness.” Not that we go out and seek it and knock at its door and pull at its hem, but that it turns towards us and addresses us. How do you contain that in the seemingly small life of one’s own ego identity? But that’s the task. So there’s that awe and even terror, but the dawning realization, hopefully over time if you can contain this, of the great life; that your life somehow is attended by and connected to these energies. It’s a short step into some theological considerations here. The theology of God or the gods reaching out to the mortal world and that God or the gods are completed by the human experience or reflect or are the reflective part of the godhead; and, so, to experience the reality of that—the reality of the psyche in which this is happening from an inward place—is the meaning of life. We can’t live life without making that connection. Another way to talk about that, of course, is alchemically. It’s another paradigm to use. There are many paradigms. Some of the great experiences are of that world reaching out to us, whether it’s the divine realm or the Anima or Animus figure reaching out to the dreamer. It wants connection with you. Another way to put that is: Imagine that there is a process going on in us that wants to hammer us into gold or wants to transform us into gold, so that it can turn itself into hammered gold. That’s the image I was having. It wants to take us from the untransformed and undifferentiated to the most highly transformed and differentiated. It’s constantly attempting to enact itself in us if we will but listen. Sometimes, like with you, it breaks right through, powerfully, terrifyingly, and demands our attention. Its purpose, ultimately, is to make gold. We can’t do that all at once. It’s a lifetime process, really only complete with our last breath. But if we do not do it, we are not living our lives. It’s how we began initially: “If you don’t pay attention, it will kill you;” meaning if you don’t pay attention to the process that wants you to participate with it, you will not live your authentic life. You can only know what your authentic life is, not from achieving the highest success in your field, but by truly living out your vocation, that which is calling you. Hopefully, there is a wonderful parallel of success in real life, however you measure that, with a deep sense of fulfillment. One is always respectful of Jung’s last dream where the gold was in amongst the roots of the great tree.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Jill Gregory</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Jill, what excites you the most about dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What interests me is their potential for transforming how we experience life; what we believe and think, how we feel and what we do with our lives. Dreaming gives us an alternate world to explore which functions according to related and yet different laws. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> When did you first become involved in dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> My involvement with dreams began with a nightmare I had when I was four years old. In waking life, while he was driving, my father always used to run a car wheel off the shoulder of the road and it would terrify me. I thought we would go off into the marsh. In the dream I'm in the car with my parents. My father's driving, my mother's in the front seat and I'm in the back seat. In the dream that's what happens. We go off into the marsh and the car starts sinking. I wake up as the mud is going into my nose, ears and eyes. After my parents and I had responded to the dream the best that we knew how, I was still gripped with terror when I reentered my bedroom to return to sleep. I knew that we had not resolved the dream. I vowed that I would find out the connection between waking and dream reality.</p>

<p>This launched countless experiments testing theories that I had encountered. Many years of frustration and ignorant effort finally gave way to a breakthrough which occurred during a dream joumaling and analysis assignment for class while I was studying philosophy and creative writing. I connected a few dreams to issues in my waking life and began to get some progress in my dreamwork. From that point on I studied everything I could get my hands on and tried to apply what I learned to my dreamlife. That took me through Gestalt, defining symbols, finding puns and making associations to symbols, noticing compensation, archetypes and mandala imagery. I attended seminars and did dream reenactment, took workshops and expressed my dreams artistically. </p>

<p>It was in Ken Keizer's Gestalt group, when I was 27 years old, that I finally worked on my four year old dream. I discovered that the child felt helpless, was afraid of dying and afraid of going to hell. Being "saved" didn't help because I still lost out on life. My four year old self didn't trust her parents or God. When I finally allowed myself to die, I found that it was okay and the energy from that dream was released. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> At what point did you become interested in lucid dreaming? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> About 10 years ago. I had been working with Senoi methods of within-the-dream dreamwork without actual lucidity. I had also been refining my recall, not only to increase the number of dreams I could remember a night, but also to improve my ability to observe the dream scene, to bring back exact shades of colors, numbers of individuals, and estimates of distance and size. With more dreams and details from each dream I was spending two to three hours just recording. I was ready for a new goal for my dream life. </p>

<p>I had no idea lucid dreaming was possible until I read Ann Faraday's book, <em>Dream Power</em>. I got very excited, expecting it would start happening right away, but it didn't. It took three months until I had my first lucid dream. That dream forecast how rich, wonderful and nurturing the discovery of lucid dreaming was going to prove in my dream life and in my waking life. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> It impresses me that you could go out and find an academic curriculum that would allow you to write a thesis with such an extensive bibliography on lucid dreaming for your B.A. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> It was tough. I had to pull a few strings to obtain a thesis advisor who would let me do it the way I wanted. Since there were no lucid dreamers on the staff of the psychology department at Dominican College at the time, I was very fortunate that Bob Shukraft, head of the department, agreed to advise me and trusted my judgment. I spent two years of energy and attention putting together the thesis, entitled, "Becoming a Lucid Dreamer." </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Was it then that you started to become more aware of the larger dream community? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Somehow my confidence, probably through dreaming and a lot of other things, was raised enough that I went to the 1985 ASD conference as a panel presenter at the lucid dreaming symposium. Fred Olsen and I met at the conference and through him I apprenticed in reentry and reimaging and attended the first meeting of the San Francisco Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers' Group. </p>

<p>That group gave me the idea that a career in dreams was possible and that, with the support of the network, I could do it. So I opened the Novato Center for Dreams (NCD) in January of this past year and launched an official professional dreamwork career including interviewing for <em>Dream Network Bulletin.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What services does your Center offer? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> The Center serves as a resource for a wide range of people, from those who have just begun to ask questions about dreams to those training for a dreamwork career or preparing to launch a dream center. I offer classes, workshops and lectures on how to develop dreamskills. We cover areas such as recall, types of dreams, journaling,dream-sharing, interpretive and non-interpretive methods of dreamwork/dreamplay, incubation and lucidity, healing dreams and flying dreams. I lead dream sharing groups. As an outreach I offer private tutoring by phone as well as in person. The Center's browsing library has over 110 books on dreams and information on dream events and resources. I display and sell dream based art and distribute my packets of "Tips for Dreamers." </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your goals for the Center? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> My overall goals involve promoting awareness and appreciation of dreams, dispelling erroneous myths and educating dreamers. The hard thing, I'm finding, is the marketing. Basically I think it's a lack of startup capital combined with a lack of practice doing it. But I think when this becomes more mainstream it won't be as much of a problem, because I think what we're doing is something that has a lot of interest and support. It's just pitifully underpublicized and that's tragic. I want to change that. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> How would you characterize your style of dreamwork?</p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Well, the worn out word "eclectic" comes to mind. I like the experiences of group style dreamwork, such as acting out the whole dream and getting group feedback. But I care most about developing individualized dreamwork methods and teaching those to people because when a person wakes up, generally there is no group available. I'm very interested in developing dreamwork methods, pulling potent elements from different methods and bringing them together in a quick and flexible layout. The main thing in terms of feeling good about yourself as a dreamer is having a bulging repertoire of dreamwork methods that you can tap into as you see fit. </p>

<p>I see myself as a coach for dreamers. I ask, what is happening in your dream life right now? What has happened before? What would you like to have happen in the future? Then I present a variety of dreamwork methods-to me that's very important. I can suggest 50 techniques and 50 great goals, but often, by doing that, they'll come up with goal 51 and technique 51 that are really tailored for them. So I encourage dreamers to come up with their version of what they really want. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your views about the dreamwork field in general? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I see it as a vulnerable new movement which will strengthen because it bears valuable gifts and because everyone has a dreamlife of one sort or another. I think it's very important right now in the dream movement for researchers and avid dreamers and dream workers to be open-minded about dreams. It's a typical human fallacy to try to reduce things to fit into various frameworks. We need to really be open because we don't know. We are a very young field despite the fact that we're a very old field, because we haven't examined millions of dream journals from age two or three on, of various cross sections from different cultures and historical periods. We don't have that data base. Therefore we really don't know. So go with what feels right for you as the dreamer and don't Jet whatever is currently being discussed - this new theory; that new theory - try to set it. Stay with your own dreams and what feels right for you.</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Any last advice for dreamers or dreamworkers? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> If there's anything that I have to offer it's that dream skills can be learned just like you take lessons to learn how to swim or play a violin. I believe that we all have incredible and quite highly developed dream lives in toddlerhood and before we're even born. It gets knocked out of us by the socialization process. </p>

<p>By doing dreamwork, we're not bringing in something artificial to mess up our lives. The mess was getting cut off from our dreams in the first place. We're just going back to something that was natural. Dreams are a natural healing function that is one of the gifts of being human. We're lucky we've got them. I wouldn't want to live without my dreams.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Jane Roberts' Seth material advocates a participant/observer mode of dream research which requires that a dreamworker be adept at <em>in-dream</em> skills. Being a dream-art scientist requires the development of specific talents. To become aware that one is dreaming, to lucid dream, is a prerequisite. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"... A practitioner of this ancient art learns first of all how to become conscious in normal terms, while in the sleep state. Then he becomes sensitive to the different subjective alterations that occur when dreams begin, happen, and end."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucidity includes the experience of hypnogogia, imageJess dreams, out-of-body and initial wakening states, mental and auditory dream periods, and other dream states which have yet to find commonly accepted names. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"He familiarizes himself with the symbolism of his own dreams..."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sethian lucid dreamers don't have to wait until waking to understand a dream symbol, they can ask while in the dream state. "Who are you?" "What do you represent?" "What message have you for me?" </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...and sees how these do or do not correlate with the exterior symbols that appear in the waking life he shares with others."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dream dictionaries become inappropriate to the Sethian who realizes that the meaning of her own dream symbols are primarily personal in nature, and furthermore, that they change over time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"There are inner meeting places, then, interior 'places' that serve as points of inner commerce and communication... Our dream-art scientist learns to recognize such points of correlation."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondarily, symbols can serve as correlating elements between dreamers, providing evidence for mutual dreaming and shared life issues. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...he or she then begins to recognize the fact of involvement with many different levels and kinds of reality and activity. He must learn to isolate these, separate one from the other, and then try to understand the laws that govern them."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a level of dreaming in which, for example, it is not possible to go through walls because one's body sense is too dense, too close to the waking state? </p>

<p><strong>Bud Harris:</strong> That book is <em>Resurrecting the Unicorn</em>: Masculinity in the 21st Century* and it grew out of my thesis in Zurich. I began by working with a fairy tale and working through my own mother complex. This process evolved into an image of masculine energy that is viable, energizing and rewarding for me. That turned into a book. Interestingly enough, writing the book became the preparation for my exams. </p>

<p>The whole thing, in my mind, came from the Self originally and basically carried me through the whole program of becoming a Jungian analyst. I was talking to Aniella Jaffe about it one time and she was telling me how my Anima was involved in that, how my Anima had given me the outline of the book and how I needed to pay attention to that. So what I have done since that time is to try to listen carefully to my own inner voices and all of my books, I believe, have evolved from the Self as it wanted me to work through and develop an issue in my own life. </p>

<p>If we delve deeply enough into ourselves, we come to a common stream with other people and our work begins to ripple out and help more people in concert. My teaching focuses around the same thing. I don’t pick my topics, my topics pick me. </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> So, you work with a very organic approach.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, but it takes a real strong effort on the part of my ego not to interfere with that process, because I have a strong and aggressive ego. I was a businessman and a college professor for a while. If I start letting those things grab hold of my creative work, then I start to lose the depth connection to it. For example, in <em>Resurrecting the Unicorn</em> there is a chapter on the Father, which led to my next book, <em>The Father Quest</em>.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> One thing that I’m wondering about, as I think of you working from the inside out, is this question: how do you arrive at the sense of self-knowledge that your Anima is giving you in the chapters to a book?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I get there by listening and that means I have to be fierce enough to give myself time to listen; but if I’m not, I’ve worked enough with my unconscious to know it will get rowdy. In the first newsletter on my website, I tell about how I fell out of bed one night and hit my head... and that was my unconscious getting rowdy and telling me I had stopped listening and that I’d better start listening to my inner voices. I listen to my Anima and my Self best by journaling. I describe that process in my book, <em>Sacred Selfishness</em>; in fact, I have a whole chapter on that because it’s so very important. Of course there are a number of different ways you can journal: you can keep a diary or you can perseverate on whatever feelings you’re stuck in. What I want to do is look at the events in my day, the emotions that they brought up in me and really take time with them. I see the journal as an exercise in listening and in self-understanding. It’s very important and dynamic. I keep dreams mixed right in with the whole thing. Active Imagination is very beneficial. I get a lot of information from the inner voice through active imagination. And I’ll admit, ultimately, that Active Imagination was the hardest thing in Jungian psychology for me to get into. It took years of effort because I had all the defenses that everybody has. I thought: I’m just making this up. This is silly. But once I crossed that barrier, it has been invaluable to me.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> I’m wondering how your dreams play into that because in one of your books, befriending the dream is the closure to each of your sections, where you talk the reader through how to work with a dream or listen to them while you’re digesting the material. Can you give us a sense of how active imagination works for you or what you recommend when working a dream?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Active imagination supports dreamwork for me after I have spent a significant amount of time with the dream: frequently just sitting with the dream, sitting with the images, sitting with the feelings, sitting with the landscape. James Hillman’s work helped me a lot with my thinking about this. I believe it’s so important to let the images live and develop before I start pursuing them with active imagination. It’s as if I’m getting to know them and getting to experience them as a part of me. Then, when I start Active Imagination with the dream image, I have developed a relationship with it. That’s Eros. Developing a relationship with a dream and its images is Eros; whereas analyzing it is Logos. I want to err on the side of Eros.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> It’s a very different frame in our culture. It’s not the usual masculine approach, I don’t think.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> What I’m going to talk about in my next lecture on complexes is how we always approach complexes from the position of Mars. We want to attack them, we want to overcome them, we want them banished, we want to fight them, we want to win; we lose sight of the fact that we are creating a war within ourselves. Whereas, when we approach them with Eros, it doesn’t mean we embrace them; but it means we get to know them before we try to decide whether we need to be aggressive with them or not.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> What can you tell us about the creative aspect of dreaming that you’ve experienced or witnessed?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Dreams are always creative. They offer us the other side of the picture of how we are living <em>that we don’t want to see</em> and part of creativity is to challenge our conventional, normal perspectives. Dreams are meant to show us a reality that’s beyond what we think reality is. I’m very appreciative of that. Dreams connect us to the archetypes, as well. If we pursue or engage with the archetypes, that too will lead us to creative fountains beyond what we normally experience. Artists in their own way have channels to their creativity and, in some cases, to the archetypes. It’s a way to bring these things into being, to encounter the paradoxes in our lives even if it doesn’t necessarily make our egos any more conscious.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Could you speak to those dreams of animals visiting us or specifically the snake images that you continue to explore in your books.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I love the image of snakes! It always reminds me of Joseph Campbell talking about snakes on a video series with Bill Moyers. He talks about how every mythology in the world involving the fall of humankind involves a snake; he says “Snake did it,” every time! I think that snakes almost always call for transformation on a very basic, instinctual level, which always means at the level of the Self coming out... and this means it’s going to be very threatening to the ego. Also, snakes call for healing; when we repress transformation and deny our healing, then we may get threatening snake dreams. We can be in a snake pit. I think animals generally appear to tell us as something about our instinctual self, as you probably know.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> You talk about serpent energy as the desire and the longing for transformation.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I begin the focus in my book on our culture, speaking to the place where advertising and marketing stimulates our desire for products and enchants us into a false life. In addition—in terms of cultural mores— the Calvinistic cloud that covers us all causes us to blindly repress many desires and eventually these can get us into trouble. But there is Serpent energy woven into all of our desires: Kundalini energy that is pushing for transformation, whether it’s conscious or not. Our desire, in general, whether it’s sacred or profane, Celestial Aphrodite or Aphrodite Pandemos, is meant to serve life. With the help of our increasing consciousness and our courage to experience it fully, it can evolve into a pursuit that will help us enlarge our lives, enlarge ourselves. Eventually, it can help us overcome demons in our personality and the limits of our own ego, which in turn, helps us experience the abundance of the Self.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> What kind of practice do you recommend to make that switch from the kind of primeval, primitive energy to a more conscious partnership with this Serpent energy?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> The first thing I recommend is to be fully engaged in life, which most of us aren’t. We hold back because we don’t want to make mistakes, we don’t want to be embarrassed, we don’t want to be ashamed. Personally, I would say first priority is to be fully engaged in life. The second thing is to begin to reflect on that life. If you’re not engaged, really there’s not that much to reflect on other than our malaise. My spiritual practices are journaling, turning to images from dreams and their stories, and Active Imagination. That’s what I do. That’s the second step. The third step is to take the results of that reflection and integrate it into your life as you’re living it.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> That’s the difficult part for most people.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> All too often—even in self-help books and psychological teachings— it’s mostly about the inside. We think that’s the end of it and we can live happily ever after. Well, the hard part comes next when we have to integrate it into our lives.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> I’m thinking of Robert Johnson’s approach to working with Active Imagination and one thing he stresses is <em>don’t act this out.</em> In other words, if you’re working with shadow material and you get in touch with it, you don’t want to rush out and do whatever it is you realize you want to do. So how do you suggest negotiating that, not acting out the shadow material but living into your dreams or living into the passionate engagement?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Well acting it out is just compulsively doing something. It’s not integrating it because, to me, integrating means giving it conscious consideration and using it to expand your personality, then deciding how you’re going to use it in your life. For example, I get in touch with my anger. I was always taught to be a good boy and I found I backed up a lot of rage. I don’t want to go out and act out that rage. What I do want to do is work through the rage in my journal and active imagination and come to understand that anger has a positive side. It tells me when my boundaries have been violated. It tells me when I need to stand up for myself and when my situation needs to change. And I need to use it to fuel how I deal with these situations consciously, not unconsciously. I don’t need to go out and lose my temper. I need to learn how to be consciously angry and to even feel empowered by that.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Sometimes, as I’m writing my dreams, it simply morphs into poetic form. Do you have any experience with this practice of writing poetry that grows out of dreams? I know that you talk a great deal about the poetic aspect of dreams.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I love poetry. It’s very expressive... another way of forging a bridge between our ego and the depth of our inner world. I believe our inner world speaks to all of us who are willing to listen. If it comes out that way—if that’s the way your inner muse wants to be expressed—I would simply do it that way. Follow your muse.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> It is another way of creatively working with dreams.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes. Most of all we are in a creative quest for silence. My wife and I are always pushing to have less busyness and less noise in our life. That doesn’t mean less work, but less of just the chatter of the world: fewer newspapers, less TV. The quietness invites the inner voice to be heard.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> One aspect of dreaming that holds a lot of interest for me is the voice in dreams. In <em>Man and his Symbols</em>, Jung is quoted as saying that you must attend the voices you hear in a dream. You can’t deny it. Often, I wake up with is just a powerful statement and it’s all I have of the dream. The voice echoes back years and years later. Do you have any strong feelings about specific voices in dreams?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, if we’re just writing the plot, we are really dishonoring the dream. We need to pay attention to it by looking at it seriously and tending our reflections on it. In terms of the voice, I would agree with Jung. If I hear a voice in a dream, you can bet I’m going to attend to it. That doesn’t mean I’m going to obey it, but I’m going to attend to it. I’m going to listen to it and I’m going to try to discern from whence it came. I might engage it in active imagination; I will take it very seriously. You may remember that at one point Jung had a dream in which he heard the voice of a woman telling him he should give up psychiatry and go to Paris and be an artist. He confronted that voice. He attended to it very seriously... but he didn’t obey it. That was the time when he was working on his Anima. He was struggling through a very dark period which is now revealed in the Red Book.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Now that we have access to the Red Book, it affords us all the opportunity to witness Jung’s visual explorations of his dreams and his approach to Active Imagination. Thank you, Dr. Harris, for sharing your personal experience with dreams, as well as your expertise. I look forward to further conversations with you on this topic. ∞ </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The <a href="https://www.lucid-dreaming-kit.com">Lucid Dreaming Kit</a></i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>The ability to maintain awareness of a dream while dreaming seems to be considered difficult if not impossible by many people. How often do we take conscious action within a dream and steer it to a more favorable outcome? Not very often. The Lucid Dreaming Kit improves our chances of realizing lucidity in dreams, using a fairly simple procedure. On one CD in the kit are instructions on how to proceed for a period of seven days in order to achieve/maintain awareness during the sleep cycle. Using a digital watch with an alarm setting on it, one is instructed to set it to beep at various intervals during designated nights. These interruptions‚ some how provoke us to maintain consciousness during sleep and help us subliminally anticipate a coming dream without waking up and losing contact with it. </p>

<p>I particularly liked the accompanying audio CD which the author recommends to play just prior to sleep. The subliminally encoded, eighty minute soundtrack enabled me to achieve a lucid dream state on the very first night that I used it. Frankly, I was rather surprised because I’ve rarely had fully lucid dreams where I was in complete control from beginning to end. I've always had the assumption that one had to actually struggle for years to achieve the lucid state. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the dream, <em>I found myself within a DNA molecule. When I instantly became aware that I was dreaming, I then took direct action and started repairing damaged telomeres, restoring the DNA to its original twenty-two strands, marveling at the codon poetry that played out before me. I would float from location to location in this marvelously illuminated DNA coil and could choose where to go and what to do. I then realized, within the dream, that the DNA molecule I was in was really of universal dimensions, spanning vast distances of interstellar space. It was more like an infinite helix, I realized, when I further investigated and started traveling through it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I was most reluctant to have the dream end and woke up with a feeling that I had achieved something rather significant. The experience was both refreshing and rather amazing as well. It did something peculiarly benign to my waking state consciousness throughout the following day, as if there was some kind of deeper connection and resonance with environments within and without me. I realized that repairing the universal DNA helped with making these deep connections and I actually physically felt better. </p>

<p>Included with the Lucid Dreaming Kit are a Lucid Dreaming screen saver for your computer, a PDF file which contains the day by day instructions the author recommends to follow in order to increase the chances of having a lucid dream and a dream log. (I recently received information from the <em>Lucid Dreaming Kit</em> creator that there is now a version of the audio CD that is eight hours long). </p>

<p>The ease of use as well as the immediate effect the CDs had on my dream life has given me sufficient indication that Thompson's method does work effectively. I've tried other methods in the past to achieve lucid dreams such as Tibetan Dream Yoga but nothing so far has given me the quick results that the Lucid Dreaming Kit has. Check it out! </p>

<p><em>Gabrielle Roth began her exploration of trance dance in the mid-1960s and has devoted her life to honoring and communicating the language of primal movement through her <strong>5Rhythms™</strong>. Her workshops connect the currents of world music, poetry, and theater with the ancient pulse of shamanism. She is author of Maps to Ecstasy, Sweat Your Prayers, and Connections and has a number of musical recordings available on the <a href="https://ravenrecording.com/">Raven</a> label.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne Schul-Elkins:</strong> For more than thirty-five years, your work has been entitled “ecstatic dance.” You have described the five universal rhythms —flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness—as a way to “sweat your prayers.” Could you help us understand how these movements offer a “gateway” to the soul? </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle Roth:</strong> Each of us is a moving center, a space of divine mystery. And although we spend most of our time on the surface dealing with the daily details of ordinary existence, we hunger to connect to this space within us. We yearn to break through to ecstatic states of consciousness, to be swept away by the beloved, and this longing is organic to who we are. </p>

<p>As a young dancer, I made the transition from the world of steps and structures to the world of transformation and trance by exposure to live drumming. It was the sixties on the wild coast of Big Sur, and sometimes these drum sessions would go on into the wee hours of the night. The beats, the patterns, the rhythms kept calling me deeper and deeper into the trance. These dances took me from the edge of myself to the moving center; as I went on this journey again and again, I recognized that the same movement patterns carried me to this blissful place. </p>

<p>In a parallel universe, I was teaching movement to thousands of people and began to observe that these patterns emerged on all dance floors, in all bodies. And so I named them and began a life long apprenticeship to the “5Rhythms!” Being young and wild and free, it didn’t dawn on me that in order to go into these deep, ecstatic places, I would have to be willing to transform absolutely everything that got in my way. That included every form of inertia known to man; from the physical inertia of tight and stressful muscles, to the emotional baggage of depressed, repressed feelings, the mental baggage of outmoded/ outdated dogmas and attitudes, philosophies. In other words, I’d have to let it all go. I’d have to let everything go. And, anyone who wanted to go on this journey would have to do the same. </p>

<p>Thus, a body of work was born in the sixties that is at least seventy-five thousand years old, and is now maturing into a contemporary Zen shamanic practice that has planted its roots and spread its wings into communities all over the world. The concept of soul has been abstracted by religion. But for me, it is a visceral reality. It is when the body, the heart and the mind are completely hooked up into a unique expression of the unified field. In other words, it’s when our style kicks in, and we truly become who we are with our own voice, our own dance, our own fashion, all the accessories to our fabulous fingerprints. </p>

<p>The “5Rhythms!” catalyze and speed up this process. In fact, they make becoming who you are a totally irresistible process.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Early in your career, you worked with Fritz Perls at Esalen. How did he influence the direction of your work?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Fritz Perls was a genius and a friend. He uprooted therapy from the past and planted it in the present; he turned it upside-down, taking it out of the head and putting it into the body. He loved dancers, and when he found out that I had put myself through school by teaching dance to kids on playgrounds, old folks in senior citizens homes, schizophrenics in mental wards, junkies in halfway houses, he was ecstatic. He invited me to teach movement to all of his gestalt therapy groups at Esalen. Thereby, he created the first lab in which I would begin my archeological dig into human nature.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gestalt Therapy, which Fritz Perls created, has a very specific approach to dreamwork. What is your experience with dreamwork?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Writing my dreams down turns me on. It’s a deep and intimate way to get to know myself. Dreams fascinate me, they’re very theatrical, and I treat them as such in my work. I love to stage them as ritual theater pieces. There is something about making them visual and visceral that allows us to go beyond them and take the next step, to make choices, to move beyond the dream. We can use the dream as a diving board into a sea of possibilities as artists, as healers, as lovers.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You are often quoted as saying, “the body never lies.” Would you talk to us about what that means within the context of your dance?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> It’s not that the body never lies, it’s that the body can’t lie. We’ve all had conversations with someone who is telling us how good they’re feeling, and yet we pick up an entirely different message. Perhaps we feel the weight of their sorrow or the edge of their anger coloring their words, shaping their body. What we’re seeing is not what we’re hearing, or what we’re hearing is not what we’re seeing, or some combination of both. The truth is what we carry in our bodies. The deceit is what we struggle with in our heads. </p>

<p>At the root of my work, we are learning to listen to the body, to truly get to know who we are in the most direct, intimate way. Through movement we become familiar with the messages, stories that we carry in our shoulders, in our hips, between our legs, and under our arms. The body is the gateway to the entire psyche. Through the body we enter into the landscape of our inner world, which includes our feelings, our thoughts, our dreams and our realities.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You emphasize connecting with imagination and intuition in your approach to dance. Does stepping into this realm of non-linear, symbolic thought process help bring about “Trance-Dance?”  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> No. Trance-dance is the gateway to an intuitive, imaginative, inspired way of being. In the “5Rhythms!” practice, we’re stretching the mind as well as the body, and exercising it as a muscle so that we are stepping out of our old, tired patterns, into our own style of moving, Our ego lives in a state of unconsciousness and self-consciousness. </p>

<p>But our soul lives, moves, and breathes in an intuitive, imaginative, inspired zone. When we dance, we shift our attention from the chattering monkey-mind to this soulful dimension. We can do the dance of the dolphin, or the dance of a stone or a spider. Through the dance, we can connect to the spirit in all things.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What do you mean by “Trance-Dance?” Could you help us understand what it looks like?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Trance is a tricky place, a place not many understand. It’s a mindful state that only happens when you get out of your way and fall into your true self so deeply that something inside clicks and you are simultaneously being and witnessing yourself. It’s not true that trance is a spell that someone else puts you under. Trance is hypnotic but it’s not hypnosis. Nobody can put you in a trance but God, and God makes you beg for it. It takes a lot of preparation to let go of being the mover and allow yourself to be moved. </p>

<p>It looks holy.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Jeanne Schul Elkins &amp; Julia Dawn Elkins</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>I grew up in a household that valued intuitive, non-linear thinking. My father, Roy Henry Schul, raised me on a heavy diet of colorful stories that depicted every phase of his life, including tales about the activities of souls who were no longer living. My mother, Thelma Jane McCollum Schul, continuously shared accounts of her psychic abilities. We lived in a two hundred year old farmhouse on a rambling dairy farm in Upstate New York with my five siblings and plenty of animals and plants of every description. </p>

<p>One of Dad's favorite stories was about his grandfather, who had come from the old country with a stash of money that he kept hidden away. He was particularly fond of his fourteen year-old granddaughter, Margaret, who used to read the Bible to him when he came to visit. Soon after his death, Margaret sat at her grandfather's piano practicing, after the rest of the family had gone out to tend to evening chores. As she played, her grandfather appeared to her and attempted to tell her something. She was shocked and frightened by the sight of him. "I never moved so fast in my life", she reported of her reaction. "When I got to my family, I was as white as a ghost, myself." My father, Margaret's younger brother, couldn't believe she fled from her own grandfather, dead or alive. He always insisted, "Grandpa was probably trying to tell her where he hid his money, so she could enjoy it. She was always his favorite!" </p>

<p>My Dad didn't draw sharp lines between life and death. He certainly wasn't threatened by the prospect of contact with those who had left this life, which was often evident in his stories. So, I guess I shouldn't have been shocked by his expectations, following my mother's sudden death; they had enjoyed more than forty years of marriage. As we sat having a cup of tea the night after Mom's death he confided to me, "Your mother never came to see me last night. Maybe she'll come tonight to say good-bye!" I, however, did not share my Dad's desire to be visited by Mom that night. In fact, I found the idea very unnerving! </p>

<p>Nine months later, when Dad was visiting me in the deep South, he complained that Mom had never come back to let him know she was okay. He went on to share how deeply he missed her. Then, he shared this dream with me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I was in heaven and was looking around everywhere for your mother. Then, I saw her. She was so beautiful and so young. She was eighteen years old. She was standing at a distance with her daughter, Mary Jane, who was also eighteen. Another young woman with them spotted me and began to walk in my direction. I immediately recognized her as Twyla, Thelma's niece. Twyla looked like a perfectly healthy eighteen year old, as well. She called me by name and asked, 'Roy, what are you doing here?' I explained, 'I came to see if Thelma was okay.' She insisted, 'You can't be here. It's not your time. You can see that Thelma is doing fine. Now you'll have to leave.' Then, I woke up."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Daddy, don't you see?" I urged. "Mom did come to you in your dream, or rather, you went to her. She let you know she is perfectly okay now." I shouldn't have been surprised that my Dad didn't make the connection. He wanted something more concrete. </p>

<p>I often feel the same way on my spiritual journey. I want to connect with the Divine on a real, human level. Perhaps that's the product of all our years on the farm; we long to be touched by the Divine on a sensory level that we can actually touch, hear, see, smell and taste. </p>

<p>In his dream, my mother was at the peek of physical perfection, no longer suffering from chronic illness at seventy-nine years old. She was reunited with her first-born child, Mary Jane, who had died tragically at the age of three (fifty-five years prior to my mother's death). In the dream, Janie, as my mother affectionately called her, had grown into a beautiful, young woman, something my mother had longed all her life. Mom was in the company of her favorite niece, who had also preceded her in death. So, my father's dream answered his need to know that my mother was healthy and surrounded by the family members she had so desperately missed while on Earth. </p>

<p>The prospect of being eighteen again probably looked very attractive to my father, who was suffering from the many complications of long-term diabetes. At eighteen, he had joined the U.S. Army during World War II and was stationed in Italy. He often showed my younger siblings and I the photographs of him in uniform and would entertain us with funny stories about his antics. We would always comment on how incredibly strong and powerful he looked back then. Perhaps my father's dream also offered him a very pleasant picture of his potential future. </p>

<p>Two years later, when my Dad died, I felt quite sure he was more than ready to be reunited with my mother. Still, I knew I would miss him deeply. When it was my turn to say good-bye, I cradled his large clasped hands in mine and asked to receive his gift of story telling. I wanted that magical essence of my Dad to be carried on into the next generation and beyond. </p>

<p>My father's dream tending and story telling have deeply informed my life, more than any degree or formal educational pursuit. Five years after his death, I took my family to Germany to visit the homeland of my great-grandfather. After a couple of weeks of touring, we celebrated Father's Day with my husband and our three daughters. Then, we returned to the home of very dear friends that evening near Hamburg, which felt very comforting after so many nights in hotel rooms. That night, on Father's Day, I had a dream. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My parents call me on the phone. In the dream, everything was as it used to be. Mom catches me up on all the news. Then, she hands the phone to my father. Dad then gave me a report on the weather and the state of the crops.</em> During this dream, however, <em>I know that I am receiving 'a call from heaven'.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Mom had lost her ability to speak fluently during the last year of her life, due to a massive stroke. I had greatly missed our long phone conversations. In my dream, she was back to her old talkative self, full of tales about the extended family and very interested in my life and children. I felt reassured of her continuing love and support of my life's journey. During my father's last couple of years, he wasn't well enough to continue his weather predictions, nor did he have the energy to care for the animals and plants that drew him into farming. In my dream, he was again filled with joy and his characteristic zest for life. I even heard his musical laughter ringing out, which always amused and delighted me as a child. It was his merriment that I so hungered for in his absence. This dream addressed my need for contact with both of my parents on a very real, sensory level. I distinctly heard each of their voices clearly, as I so often had in the countless phone calls we had exchanged during my adulthood. I awoke with tears streaming down my cheeks from the pure pleasure of hearing their voices once again and sensing that they were well and happy together in their next life. </p>

<p>Like my father before me, I went to breakfast with a story to tell that morning. I told everyone about the present I had received: a phone call from my parents in heaven on Father's Day! My friends and family were mildly interested, but my youngest daughter, then nine, was completely fascinated. Julia and I discussed the synchronicity of my dream occurring in the same way I used to always call my parents on holidays. This time, however, they called me from the afterlife. </p>

<p>Julia has always begged for just one more bedtime story. She has heard all of her Grandpa's stories retold countless times. She was the first person I ever told about my prayerful request of my Dad's storytelling abilities at his death. So, it's no wonder that Julia finds an easy connection to dreams and storytelling. She and I have told each other our dreams before going to sleep and upon waking for most of her life. Dream telling often replaces storytelling in our nightly ritual. </p>

<p>Now, as the next generation of dream tenders and storytellers, twelve-year-old, Julia Dawn Elkins, writes in her journal about dream life this way: </p>

<p>"I believe dreams are connecting with the future and clinging to the past, all at the same time! I face my reality and my hopes all in one fell swoop! In the blink of an eye, my dream may change and unveil some secret about myself which leads to an emotional journey through self and soul." </p>

<p>The evolution of the dream movement lies in the mindset of the next generation. This is imparted in the way we nurture our children. If we—as parents, teachers, therapists, and clergy—value the intuitive, non-linear thinking process that is a natural aspect of childhood, we cultivate the rich soil of their souls in which their hopes and dreams can grow and unfold.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>More than 35 years ago, in 1972, I had a dream in which my children and I are imprisoned in a strange tower surrounded by a fence and near an ocean. Having spent most of my life, including my childhood years, on college campuses, I associated “strange tower” with “ivory towers”— institutions of learning. But only much later, after studying the dream, did I understand why an “ivory tower” would be portrayed as a prison. In the dream...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...we are allowed outside for periods of time, but we always have to come back in. At times we have to hurry in to escape pursuit by fierce animals such as wild boars and wolves. Sometimes we have to climb the fence to get in to safety before being caught. We know we are being plotted against by an enemy, humans who control the wild beasts too. We feel it is just a matter of time before things will go from bad to worse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kaconf-0.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Tony Crisp, in <em>Dream Dictionary</em>, describes an enclosure in dreams as “the defenses we use, such as pride, beliefs, anger, to protect ourselves from deeply feeling the impact of the world, relationship, love, anxiety, or pain. These are often felt as traps or restraints, even though they are parts of our personality.” Wild beasts can represent emotional aspects or animal instincts that are uncontrolled and unpredictable. </p>

<p>In 1972 I was the 36-year-old mother of two young children living on a college campus where my husband was a professor. At that time, my beliefs probably came from at least three different sources: first, from my parents who impressed upon me a preferred pattern of behavior and set of beliefs; second, from teachers and other authority figures on both social and religious matter; third, from the present college community in which we lived with its own set of expectations for one’s behavior and activities. In the dream, <em>we are caught in a double-trap between opposite dangers—wild beasts on the outside and our captors on the inside</em>—and I was more fearful of what was outside than what was inside. I knew of no way out of confinement. Evidently, the beliefs that were instilled in me as I was growing up caused me to be fearful of what I found in the outside world, and at the time of this dream I felt overwhelmed. But I was conscious neither of feelings of confinement nor of the source of such feelings. The dream was trying to bring this matter into my awareness.</p>

<p>In a dream from 1995,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m trying to escape an institution. A woman to whom I appeal for help shows me, by example, a way to escape.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>George Slater suggests in <em>Bringing Dreams to Life</em> that “images of public buildings, such as institutional... buildings... may refer to being trapped in collective thinking, where the individual is submerged by the institution. Inasmuch as they are man-made, they may refer to structures of a person’s own life experience that have been socially imposed.” </p>

<p>This dream revealed that on an unconscious level I was trying to leave a confining situation, to break away from constricting thoughts and beliefs that may have been imposed by the collective, as well as to call into existence my own set of beliefs and to allow my own individuality to blossom. It was definitely a time in my life in which I needed to get away from old assumptions and expectations of what was important and how I should behave. My conscious mind was very focused on the desire to move from the college community in which we had lived for thirty years. </p>

<p>I was already working on house plans for our retirement home in a new community. </p>

<p>This new dream pointed out that a woman, representing my nurturing, inner feminine, was assisting me. After I was diagnosed with breast cancer a year earlier, at least two of the doctors I consulted urged me to nurture myself as a part of my healing process. Although I didn’t understand it at the time, the dream revealed that I had begun the nurturing process. <em>In Guided by Dreams: Breast Cancer, Dreams and Transformation</em>, I recount how dreams guided various decisions I made during my treatment and recovery. In early 2008, after a passage of thirteen more years, my unconscious was still working on the matter of beliefs, as shown in the following dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I are in some building, almost like a castle. We find ourselves in a large area with many doors and many people. We, along with others, are trying to find our way out of this space. However, whenever we try to open a door, it appears to be locked. Occasionally someone seems to find a way out, but we can’t figure out how s/he does it. At some point my husband disappears and I have no idea where he has gone. I begin to feel desperate. I see someone over to one side who I sense may know “the secret” (to finding a way out of this confinement). She seems to be just hanging around as if she has some official role at this “amusement center.” I go over and almost beg for help, expressing my sense of despair and desperation. The woman smiles knowingly, but acknowledges she can’t tell me; I must figure out the solution for myself. She hints at something to do with buttons, maybe saying something simple and obvious. I don’t recall what this is. I go back to the “doors” and finally spot something, perhaps the buttons, that she might have been referring to. I try pushing one and, sure enough, a door opens to the outside. I hurry out, joining a crowd of people heading down a path leading from this high location. I can tell that at some distance down the path it appears to get terribly steep. I think I see people sliding swiftly down at that point. It looks dangerous, but obviously it is the only way to go.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kaconf-1.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I associate the castle situated on a high location with an archetypal storybook castle. I also think of the “ivory towers” that suggest to me institutions of learning and connect this dream to the earlier ones discussed above. </p>

<p>In this new dream, <em>my husband and I find ourselves with many others in another confining place and we are trying to open the locked doors that will provide a way out.</em> As in the earlier dream, <em>I ask a woman (my inner feminine) for help. Although she offers a helpful hint, she says we must find the solution—the way out of confinement—for ourselves.</em> So here is one more metaphoric dream showing my desire to escape the confines of thoughts and beliefs that are hindering my development. Evidently, I still need to figure out what these beliefs are. </p>

<p>I find the timing of the dream significant, since it came the night before my husband and I began participation in a study group on Eckhart Tolle’s book <em>A New Earth.</em> Tolle states that the book’s main purpose is to bring about a shift in consciousness to help us escape the collective dysfunction of the human mind, to transform the distortions of egoic human mind.</p>

<p>He writes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The change goes deeper than the content of your mind, deeper than your thoughts. In fact, at the heart of the new consciousness lies the transcendence of thought, the newfound ability of rising above thought, of realizing a dimension with yourself that is infinitely more vast than thought. We will come to realize that the ‘voice in my head’ is not who I am. I am the awareness that is prior to thought, the space in which the thought— or the emotion or sense of perception—happens.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I note, in reflection on this last dream, that I termed the confining space an “amusement center.” We entertain ourselves constantly with our chattering thoughts. In the dream I “push the right button” and make it out to join others who have escaped. I need to figure out what “the right button” represents in waking life. Perhaps the very steep and seemingly dangerous descent we still must go down represents going down into our unconscious. In the dream this is the only way to completely get away from the confinement in the “castle.” Additional dreams can help me do this. </p>

<p>In a second dream the same night,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am trying to find my way home from some meeting or conference. I have many “papers” with me as well as my pocketbook. I seem to be having trouble figuring out just where I am and which direction I should go. At some point where I have stopped, perhaps to rest/ sleep, I become alarmed when I realize my things have disappeared. I become frantic, fearing I won’t be able to find my way home without the papers and my pocketbook that contains my money and my identification. I’ll be stuck where I am. I’m relieved when someone helps me find/spot my pocketbook. At least I’ll have means to continue on my way.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I equate “home” with our place of origin to which we return at the end of our earthly life. I am trying to find my way there after attending meetings and/or conferences (all the places I go to try to receive guidance for my journey through life), but I am not sure “where I am and which direction I should go.” I fear the loss of my credentials and my money will prevent me from being able to continue on my way. I am relieved when someone helps me find what I thought was lost. This would seem to be a positive outcome; but is it? Perhaps I am too attached to my identification with my ego. Perhaps I still need to learn to let go. David Gordon would classify this as a Dream of Attachment, as he discusses in his book Mindful Dreaming. He and Tolle point out we need to let go of these kinds of attachments to allow something new to emerge in our life. Gordon, in an article about his book, states, “Dreams of Attachment and Letting Go prompt us to grieve and release our attachment to the causes of our suffering. In so doing we awaken—much like those who report near-death experiences—to a deeper contentment and fuller peace than we ever imagined.” </p>

<p>Several books I have been reading recently seem to tie all these ideas together. David Richo in The Five Things We Cannot Change... and the Happiness We Find by Embracing Them presents many of the same ideas, perhaps in a slightly different manner. He states,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Paradoxically, an unconditional yes to who I am, how others are, and what the world is, places me in the best position to grow. We can say Yes! to participating in our own evolution and working toward our life purpose in three ways: by cultivating psychological health, spiritual maturity, and mystical oneness or spiritual awakening. These are not three levels that follow one another linearly; they stand as one integral whole. Each is complete only when it includes the other two. To integrate these three dimensions of ourselves is to combine sanity and sanctity.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreamwork is one of the best ways we can say “Yes!” to participating in our own evolution and working toward our life purpose. Dreams can help us understand what is going on within ourselves—emotionally, psychologically, spiritually and physically. </p>

<p>My discussion so far has dealt with the dreams’ importance for me personally. Personal dreams can also have a message for the collective. In the third dream discussed above, my husband and I <em>“find ourselves in a large area with many doors and many people. We, along with others, are trying to find our way out of this space.”</em> This suggests that an awakening may be taking place among many people—many who have been trapped as I have been by confining beliefs and are trying to find their way out. The fact that thousands of people around the world have been studying Eckhart Tolle’s book by means of the Oprah webcast may be one concrete example.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>How did a dream of mine recorded in November 2002 have anything to do with the Election of 2004? Back then, I had no idea that it did. Some understanding of the dream’s significance came 21 months later after having another dream that I decided must be connected. Here’s the first dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I Visit a Mysterious Place Along with Other People</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>I’m visiting some “establishment”— looking around the large building housing the “place.” There’s a large room that seems to have various spaces used for different purposes. One side is fitted out with rows of seats like church pews. A small area opening onto this seems to be used differently—I see couches and tables. Beyond this is a doorway leading into an area evidently not open to the public.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I’m there with unidentified people. We begin to sense that the place is used for some secret purpose. We are not allowed to explore beyond this “open” area. I say I think even this area with rows of seats, which we are led to assume is a church, has another purpose. I don’t know what. There are “officials” standing to the side overseeing the visit and keeping us from exploring beyond this area. If anyone should try to explore farther, we all would be asked to leave.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>When we do leave the building, we’re surprised to discover that the road into the place has been destroyed—we assume to keep others out. We have to figure a way to get out by finding a path our vehicle can travel. As we get to the edge of the property, we find a vehicle about to enter. I feel we need to warn them about what they may find.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams are messages from our inner selves, drawing background material from our lives and the personal as well as the collective unconscious. Dreams always have multiple meanings and layers of significance. They can deal with our physical health, emotional and psychological status, spiritual life, and relationships with other people. They may also be bringing into consciousness a collective issue or circumstance. </p>

<p>At the time of this dream there was nothing going on in my personal life to which this dream seemed to refer. But considering a “building” to be a symbol for one’s self, perhaps this dream was pointing out that there was a part of me not open to the public, a part that I keep private. This certainly is true, I already was aware of this. But dreams come to bring new understandings, not to point out what you already know. I put the dream aside and hoped further illumination would come later. It came with this next dream in early September 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>While Helping Prepare the “Dance” Floor, I Worry about the Proposed “Game of War” I’m with an unidentified person in a public gathering place. We’re helping clean/prepare some type of dance/recreation space. We are required to do this. I’m complaining to my companion about the situation. Evidently the men in charge are proposing some type of “game” in which others will be required to participate. It is a “game of war.” I say I don’t understand how they can want to do this. It will involve serious consequences for so many people. My companion agrees with me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My immediate association to “the men in charge” requiring others to participate in a “game of war” that will “involve serious consequences for so many people” was our government and our involvement in Iraq. Now there’s the connection to the 2004 Election. </p>

<p>I decided to look back through my dream journals for other dreams of authority figures, dreams that might be connected to this dream. That’s when I saw anew the November 2002 dream recounted at the beginning of the article. In it I visited “some establishment” which we sensed “is used for some secret purpose” where “we are not allowed to explore beyond this ‘open’ area” and “officials” were “overseeing the visit and keeping us from exploring beyond this (open) area.” I now consider this a reference to the then current administration’s policies of secrecy and deception in place in 2002. Examples materialized as it became evident that the real reason for waging war in Iraq was hidden and denied. Decisions and deals with war profiteers were shrouded with secrecy behind closed doors, and the photographs of consequences of the war (dead soldiers, body bags, and coffins) were banned from public view. </p>

<p>In the dream, I said I thought the area with seats like church pews had another purpose. In waking life I believe the faith-based advocacy of the administration at that time was being used to push a right-wing moral agenda and perhaps to support the ideological agenda of the groups to whom support was given. Unfortunately, I think, [and now in the Fall of 2013 I <em>know</em>], the right-wing ideologues are still pushing their agenda. </p>

<p>Next we “discover that the road into the place has been destroyed—we assume to keep others out.” Access to/communication with the government had been destroyed. “We have to figure a way to get out by finding a path our vehicle can travel.” We, the people, needed to find a way out of this situation. The second half of the more recent dream suggested a way. It stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sometime later, after completing our chore, we watch as a couple dances around the outside of the special floor area where we are standing. I comment on how well they are dancing. Then I notice that the woman is much older than the man, who appears to be a teenager. She is “leading.” I comment that she is showing him how to dance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The space we prepared for the game of war had become a dance floor where a couple was engaged in a graceful dance, the dance of life. This is very different from a game of war. </p>

<p>I believe the young male represented our historically young patriarchally dominated nation, one involved in repeated aggressive games of war. I was encouraged to see he was being instructed by the older woman who might represent wise, mature feminine attributes, perhaps even the divine feminine. I hope she was “leading” him back to ways of pre-patriarchal cultures in which people lived without the need of fortifications and weapons, sharing with and caring for all beings. </p>

<p>Dreams come in the service of health and wholeness. In this case, not just for an individual but the collective—the whole world. May we as a nation learn the ways of peace.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>As American bombs began raining down on the city of Baghdad, I found myself in shock, feeling as if we are living in a world gone mad. I feel impotent, seemingly unable to have any effect whatsoever on the horror of what is playing out as reality television on the screen in front of me. What is happening seems totally surreal, as if I find myself in some sort of dream. </p>

<p>Our world is in a completely disassociated state, where the opposites are totally polarized and want to kill each other. It is like we are living in apocalyptic times. The inner meaning of the word apocalypse means <em>something hidden being revealed</em>. Could it be that there is something being shown to us through the events that are manifesting in our world today, if we could only see? </p>

<p>Very dark, diabolical forces are manifesting in our universe. Regardless of our point of view, pro-war or antiwar, I don't imagine that anyone would disagree that an extremely dark energy is manifesting. The word <em>diabolos</em> actually means that which separates, that which divides. The antonym and antidote to the diabolic is the symbolic. Whereas the diabolic dis-integrates, symbols and symbolic awareness brings together and unites that which has been divided. Could there be a clue here to what is being shown to us? </p>

<p>In the apocryphal <em>Acts of John</em>, it says, "... the Lord contrived all things symbolically and by a dispensation towards men, for their conversion and salvation." Symbols are the language of dreams and the unconscious. Symbols are very different than signs, whose meaning is literal, known and can be conveyed in words. Symbols are not only emanations and point to something beyond themselves, but actualize and liberate the energy of this deeper state when we understand them. Symbols are psychic energy transformers which reflect, express and effect a change in consciousness itself. To quote Jung, 'There are, and always have been, those who cannot help but see that the world and its experiences are in the nature of a symbol, and that it reflects something that lies hidden in the subject himself'. I find myself wondering how this 'war' would look if we began seeing it symbolically, instead of viewing what is playing out in our world literally. This means to view our situation in the world today AS IF it actually were a dream that a deeper, dreaming part of ourselves is dreaming up into materialization, and then interpret it as such. </p>

<p>We can view what is happening in Iraq as a "dreamed up phenomenon", an externalization of an inner process; a mass shared dream that all six billion of us have mutually dreamed up into incarnation. What is getting played out in our world is then recognized to be a full-bodied reflection, in symbolic form, of a conflict going on deep inside the collective consciousness of humanity. We can then ask ourselves, what is this dreaming process showing us. What does it mean? What does it show us about the forces deep at work in the dreamer's psyche, who is none other than ourselves? How would we interpret the symbols of this waking dream that is actually unfolding in and as our life itself? </p>

<p>When I contemplate the current world situation AS IF it were a dream, something profound becomes revealed to me. A deeper pattern begins to emerge, a deeper process that underlies and is unfolding through, in and as events on our planet. Peter Jennings of ABC News said to a commentator at the Pentagon, "Let's get the bigger picture". What follows is an inquiry into "the bigger picture", the dreaming process that is in-forming and giving shape to events in our world today; the collective dream of our planet.</p>

<h2>The Universe as a Waking Dream</h2>

<p>'Everything unconscious, once it was activated, was projected into matter—that is to say, it approached people from outside', said Jung. When there is an unconscious factor, it always gets projected out. It is literally, as well as symbolically, 'dreamed up' into materialized form into the (waking) dreamfield. Jung realized that projection was not just a defence mechanism, but was the very process through which we become conscious of unconscious parts of ourselves. Provided, of course, that we recognize the projected content is a reflection of that part of ourselves. When recognized, we can then withdraw the projection, embracing and owning the projected content. </p>

<p>In dreamwork, all parts of the dream are seen to be aspects of the dreamer's self. For what is a dream other than our inner process projected out—into and as—the dreamscape? A dream is clearly an out-picturing, a projection of an inner process that is going on deep inside the psyche of the dreamer. The same process is at work in our waking life. To the extent that we are unconscious of our inner process, it will literally get dreamed up into—as and through—our universe, in full-bodied, but symbolic form. I think of Jung saying, 'The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves'. </p>

<p>To see this universe as a waking dream is to realize that it is embedded in an emanation, a reflection, a projection, a shadow, an echo, of a higher-dimensional reality that is speaking symbolically. Seen as a dreaming process, this universe is reflecting back to us that we need to become more fluent in its language, which is symbolic 'dreamspeak'. </p>

<p>This is why in Tibetan Buddhism one of the translations of the word for Enlightenment is the Great Symbol. The universe is a symbol of itself, both veiling and re-vealing its true symbolic nature at every instant. This reminds of the eastern idea of Maya, who is the source of both the deepest illusion and the highest creativity. </p>

<p>This dreamlike nature of our reality has been articulated in quantum physics, and is called the <em>observer effect</em>. The act of observing our universe actually evokes the universe observed. This realization points to the thought that it makes no sense whatsoever to even talk about an objective universe, as well as an independent observer separate from the universe. For the observer and the observed, the subject and the object interpenetrate one another so fully that we can't even talk about them as being in any way separate. What quantum physics is describing is what I call the physics of the dreamlike nature of reality. </p>

<p>In Buddhism, this process is called <em>interdependent co-origination</em>, in which every part of the universe evokes (dreams-up) and is, concurrently, evoked by (dreamed-up by) every other part of the universe. This is a circular, nonlinear, a-causal, beginningless feedback loop that happens in no time, outside of time... quicker than the twinkling of an eye. </p>

<p>To re-cognize this dreamlike nature is to step out of the linear, literal mind-set of materialism into symbolic awareness, in which matter is 'immaterialized'. This, in order to gain insight into the nature of the symbols that are appearing in our waking dream. They are seen to be an expression of the interplay between the dreamscape and the dreamer, since the two are not separate. The dreamer and dreamscape are mutually effecting one another in a synchronistic, cybernetic feedback loop; the dreamer and the dream reciprocally effect and in-form one another, co-arising simultaneously. This is an expression in which both the dream and the dreamer are contained in and are parts of a higher unity. They are not separate. </p>

<h2>Shadow Projection</h2>

<p>When viewed as a dreaming process and seen symbolically, it is clear that there is total polarization going on deep inside the dreamer, when the opposites are totally split, disassociated and trying to destroy one another. A reflection of this intense inner polarization is happening deep inside the collective consciousness of humanity and it is the 'shadow projection' going on in this waking dream of ours. Psychologically speaking, projecting the shadow is a perverse way of dealing with our own darkness by projecting it onto someone else and imagining that the other is the embodiment of the darkness that ultimately belongs to ourselves. Each side of the polarity is overly identified with the light, or God, splitting off and seeing the other as the embodiment of evil... even of Satan himself, e.g., Bush seeing Saddam Hussein, the terrorists seeing the Americans, the Palestinians seeing the Israelis in this way, as well as visa versa. It should be noted that it is this exact same psychological phenomenon that occurred in Hitler's Europe towards the Jews during the second World War. </p>

<p>Psychologically, it is a very dangerous situation, since a person (or a nation) can become fanatically identified with their point of view, unable to self-reflect, and become possessed by the hero, or saviour archetype. This figure is religious in nature, as it derives from the transpersonal, archetypal dimension of the collective unconscious. The person (or nation) inflated with the hero or saviour archetype wants to save the world from evil. By projecting the shadow onto the 'other' and wanting to destroy them, we literally become possessed by the very same darkness we are trying to destroy, thereby perpetuating a never-ending cycle of violence. </p>

<p>This dynamic is a reflection of and analogous to how—when we are split off and disassociated—the trauma that is at the root of this process endlessly re-creates itself. Seen symbolically, we are at war with a mirrored reflection of our own shadow, engaged in a battle</p>

<p>that can never be won. Etymologically, the word mirror actually means <em>'shadow holder'</em>. If this process of shadow projection continues to go unrecognized and continues to get acted out unconsciously, we can undoubtedly expect not only more dreaming processes like this in the future, but we can expect the message to hit us over the head even more forcefully. </p>

<p>I find myself <em>associating</em>, as if working on a dream. To associate is circular, it is to step out of the linear, sequential, literal and casual mode of thinking intrinsic to the conceptual mind and connect with our intuition, with our divine, creative imagination. To associate is to activate symbolic awareness. To associate is to step into the very dreaming mind that dreams our dreams. I associate to Jung, who describes shadow projection as 'the lie'. I immediately associate to <em>Diabolos</em>, the Devil, who is the liar. </p>

<p>The daemonic, by definition, is a powerful archetypal, transpersonal (beyond the personal) energy that—if we are not in conscious relationship to it—can literally possess us and act itself out through us... whether 'it' be an individual, a group, a nation, or a planet. To quote noted psychologist Rollo May, the daemonic '... is any natural function which has the power to take over the whole person... the daemonic can be either creative or destructive... a fundamental, archetypal function of human experience— an existential reality'. May asserts that violence 'is the daemonic gone awry'. When an unconscious daemonic content is ready to be integrated in a dreaming process, be it personal or collective, it always, to quote Jung, '... forces the subject into its own form, it always appears physically'. The daemonic content—at the point where it is available to be assimilated by consciousness —will both literally, as well as symbolically, get 'dreamed up' into materialization. What this means is that encoded in symbolic form in the manifestation of the daemonic, is it's own re-solution, it's own transcendence. The key to how the situation will resolve is none other than consciousness itself. </p>

<h2>Incarnation as Trauma</h2>

<p>Seen as a dreaming process, what is happening in our world today is not only traumatic to the psyche of tender humankind, but is itself an expression of trauma getting acted out and perpetuating itself in a never-ending cycle. In trauma, we split-off and disassociate from a part of ourselves, becoming alien to ourselves. In trauma, we endlessly and compulsively re-create the trauma, in what is called the repetition compulsion. In the repetition compulsion—a dynamic that Freud rightly calls daemonic—the very act of trying to complete the incomplete process and heal the trauma is the very act that endlessly re-creates it. </p>

<p>Trauma is stored in the daemonic or archetypal dimension of the psyche and to be accessed, so as to be unlocked and integrated, trauma needs to be incarnated (or dreamed up) in embodied form. This is the underlying teleology of the repetition compulsion. We should take note that when a daemonic energy is ready to be integrated, it, too, forces the subject into its own form and gets dreamed-up into, as and through life itself. </p>

<p>It is profoundly important to be aware when an archetypal energy such as evil manifests in a dreaming process where it can be seen. This is not the first time this has happened in our world, it is a recurring situation. When things happen more than once in a dreaming process—the recurring dream— this should get our attention and become an object of serious contemplation. </p>

<p>I immediately associate to the Christ event, in which God incarnated through one man 2000 years ago. When read symbolically, as a dreaming process, God's dark and light sides were totally split, completely polarized in the figures of Christ, who was totally light, and Satan, who was the embodiment of the darkest evil. Jung said, 'It looks as if the super-abundance of light on one side had produced all the blacker darkness on the other'. There was a complete disassociation between the two. This is not merely coincidence, as when the Self incarnates, the opposites fly apart into complete polarization. This is a reflection of the deep, inner split in the collective consciousness of humanity and we could say, the mind of God, as well. It is also an expression that some deeper process is emerging or incarnating. </p>

<p>I find myself wondering if maybe there's a deeper meaning to why our Christianity's myth of the incarnation of God 2000 years ago in Christ was in the form of a trauma, of an abuse drama (the crucifixion). Seen symbolically, trauma is mysteriously related to the incarnation of the Self. Is there a difference between God—who is one with everything and all—putting nails through his own body during the crucifixion, and propelling jet planes through skyscrapers on September 11? Or dropping bombs on cities? Isn't God throwing jet planes through pentagons alchemical dismemberment at its most embodied level? </p>

<p>When seen as a dreamed up phenomenon, the Christ event— and in particular the crucifixion —symbolizes the mysterious correspondence between incarnation (of the Self) and trauma. The cross is a perfect symbolic image of holding the tension of the opposites. Instead of identifying with one side of the polarity and repressing, and hence projecting out into the dreamscape (dreaming-up) the other side—which is the splitting that is characteristic of the traumatized soul—Christ on the cross was the perfect symbol of holding both of the opposites simultaneously. Holding the tension of the opposites is symbolized by being nailed, being really stuck... and is a veritable crucifixion for the ego, which feels its utter impotence and helplessness. A genuine passion play. A true <em>agonia</em>. Unresolved trauma is a literal 'holding pattern'. </p>

<p>When the opposites become totally polarized, this is symbolically related to the crucifixion and is an expression of a potential expansion in-and-of consciousness. To be going through this ordeal consciously is to be nourishing the Self and genuinely imitating Christ. Instead of a symptom, a symbol emerges. Jung calls this the reconciling symbol, or the transcendent function. It is a genuine symbol emerging from the creative tension of holding the opposites, which both unites and transcends the opposites; it both reflects and effects an expansion in-and-of consciousness. This is analogous to the resurrected body coming forth after the crucifixion. This is something the ego could not have done by its own devices. It is truly revelatory; we call it grace, as if it comes from God. </p>

<p>An overwhelming traumatic experience renders us incapable of integrating it in a typical way. Trauma forces us to re-create ourselves anew. Trauma propels us to not only create a new personal and collective mythology, but demands that we connect in a deeper way with our mythologizing, dreaming and imaginative powers. The only way to heal from trauma is to assimilate it, which demands that we radically evolve to a higher state. Trauma is therefore initiatory, as it furthers the evolution of the species. </p>

<p>To say trauma is initiatory means that the experience of trauma itself is the very medium through which a deeper level of consciousness is potentially actualized. I associate to the archetype of the wounded healer, who discover the blessings hidden in their wounding if—and only if—they are able to snap out of the victim identity and experience their wounding as a numinous event that came from God. </p>

<h2>The Death of the Old King</h2>

<p>Jung felt that the major archetypal, mythic process happening in our world today was the death and transformation of the old king, the <em>senex</em>. The aging, sick and dying king is the negative patriarchy, the mythic terrible father, who has become rigidified, egocentric and abuses POWER over others. The negative father is <em>Cronos</em>, father time, linear time. This figure is in need of transformation because he has become disassociated from eros, relatedness, the heart, feeling, and from the feminine. Symbolically, the old and ailing king represents a dominant of consciousness that has outlived its usefulness and become antiquated and anachronistic. This is why in alchemy, the <em>prima materia</em>—which is the stuff that needs to be transformed in order to make the gold of consciousness—is oftentimes pictured as an old man. This figure of the old king needs to be symbolically dis-membered and reintegrated in a higher synthesis, so as to give birth to the hero or heroine who is in touch with the creative. </p>

<p>To symbolically kill the terrible father is to stop interpreting our experience personalistically, reductively and literally, as we snap out of the spell of linear time and wake up to the symbolic, synchronistic dimension of existence. To have symbolic awareness is to re-associate, to re-member, which is the opposite of and the antidote to, being dis-membered. To recognize the dreamlike nature of our experience is to transform the figure of the rigid, concretized old king, who is the figure that is not only acting itself out on the stage of our world, but is a reflection of an inner figure who lives inside all of us. To transform this figure is the birth of the mythical and mystical Sophia, who is none other than the personification of wisdom. </p>

<h2>The Incarnation of God Has Already Happened</h2>

<p>Seen as a dreaming process, Christ is a living, breathing symbol of the Self, of our wholeness, of our holiness. We could even say he is a symbol of God that was dreamed up and emanated out of and into the waking dreamscape. Christ was a perfect symbol, bringing together and interpenetrating the heterogeneous natures of God and humankind in one being. </p>

<p>Christ, in the apocryphal (literally, secret book) <em>Acts of John</em>, shows John a 'cross of light' and says 'This is not the cross of wood which you will see when you go down from here, neither am I he that is on the cross'. Christ himself is instructing John how to view his experience symbolically, as an emanation of and portal into a higher-dimensional reality. </p>

<p>Like any symbol, the Christ event expresses and constellates analogous psychic processes in the beholder. This is why Christ says, 'A mirror am I to you that know me... but if you understand me, you shall be in your understanding as I am... behold what you are. I have shown you... behold what is thine through me'. </p>

<p>Seen as a dreamed-up phenomenon, the Christ event is an unmediated expression or embodied manifestation of a deeper process going on inside the psyche of humankind, as well as the mind of God, that both literally—as well as symbolically —got dreamed-up into materialization, into incarnation, in-through-and-as this very universe of ours. The Christ event was the incarnation, in embodied human form, of an atemporal process that exists outside space/time itself. It is a reflection—in symbolic form—of this higher-dimensional process of the birth and incarnation of God in-through-and-as humanity. </p>

<p>Seen symbolically, the Christ event is showing that the birth of the Self — the incarnation of God through humanity — has already happened in the <em>pleroma</em>, the atemporal fullness of the collective consciousness. The event simply needs to be recognized as such to be made real in time. In other words, the process of the incarnation of God through humanity is playing itself out in linear, sequential time in our world; yet in the atemporal, higher-dimensional reality in which our universe is contained, this process of divine incarnation is recognized to have already been accomplished and is merely actualizing itself through events in this world. </p>

<h2>Revelation of the Dark God</h2>

<p>The word <em>apocalypse</em> means something hidden that is being revealed. God is revealing him/herself through events in our world. It is the revelation of what is called the dark or hidden God, the <em>'deus absconditus'</em>, the wrath of God with all it's Luciferian ferocity. To quote Jung, 'God asserts his power through the revelation of his darkness and destructiveness. Man is merely instrumental in carrying out the divine plan'. </p>

<p>Scholar Rudolph Otto calls it the <em>'negative numinosum'</em>, or the <em>'mysterium horrendum'</em>, as compared to the <em>'mysterium tremendum'</em>. It is the dark side of God, the other hand of God, which fills us with awe. Seen as a dreaming process, it is the return of the repressed, as the part of God that has been denied is the part of God that insistently shows up in a form we would least expect. Interestingly, the inner meaning of the word Satan is the shadow of the Lord. </p>

<p>I immediately associate that Jung refers to Satan as 'the godfather of man as a spiritual being', by which he means that Satan can activate in humankind a process of spiritual awakening. The original meaning of Satan in Hebrew was an angel of God who obstructs. Symbolically, Lucifer is the necessary dark side of life, of shadow revealing light by contrast; Lucifer means the bringer of light. By rebelling against God, Jung continues, 'Lucifer was perhaps the one who best understood the divine will struggling to create a world and who carried out that will most faithfully'.</p>

<p>Jung was very impressed by the paradoxical role that evil played in people's lives. He saw that oftentimes the emergence of evil into a person's dreaming process later revealed itself to be an initiation into a higher good, which was unattainable before its manifestation. This is why he says, 'I am indeed convinced that evil is as positive a factor as good'. As he points out, Lucifer was 'necessary and indeed indispensable for the unfolding and completion of the divine drama'. In alchemy, the most evil figure itself was, to quote Jung, 'destined to be the medicina'. The monsters of the unconscious stand in a secret, compensatory relationship to the ego, supplying everything the ego needs. Jung points out 'It does not seem to fit God's purpose to exempt a man from conflict and hence from evil'.</p>

<p>Over and over again we come up against the figure of Satan, of the Devil, <em>diabolos</em>, Lucifer, the shadow... of the daimonic. What is the meaning of this? What the ancients called demons Jung calls autonomous complexes. Autonomous complexes are split-off parts of the psyche due to an overwhelming trauma that the conscious ego can't assimilate. They develop a seemingly independent and autonomous existence. Like vampires, these autonomous complexes violently resist the light of consciousness, they can't stand to be seen, as being seen takes away their autonomy and omnipotence. The demons best hiding place is in unconscious identification with ourselves, where they can't be seen. They are then able to both project the demon 'out there', while acting themselves out through us. </p>

<p>To see this daemonic power is to recognize it's hidden hand in what is getting acted out in our world. This is why we exorcise the daemonic by naming it, which is to see it and objectify it... which is to be separate from it and take a stance towards it. This is the true power of the Word. </p>

<p>To see the shadow of the Lord, to recognize that it is, paradoxically, totally 'other' while simultaneously a reflection of what is inside ourselves, is to de-potentiate the daemon, so to speak. It is to alchemically transmute and liberate the energy that was bound up in the daemonic compulsion to recreate and re-enact our trauma. This energy becomes available for creatively expressing our greatest love and highest genius. </p>

<p>The word genius is related to the word genie, as in 'I dream of,' and both of these words are related to the word daemon, which actually means the guiding spirit or inner voice. To be genuinely 'imitating Christ' in this sense means to be following, listening to and honoring our inner voice with as much integrity as Christ followed his. The inner voice is related to our 'calling, ' which implies a higher fate or destiny. Finding our calling is to find our true vocation, which is what we are here to do. This is why Christ says, 'If you bring forth what is within you, what is within you will redeem you. If you don't bring forth what is within you, what is within you will destroy you'. Jung openly professed to be in the jaws of his daemon, but was able to transmute it into his creative insights that have helped all of humanity. </p>

<p>When the daemonic is not seen and related to consciously, it possesses us from behind and acts itself out unconsciously through us, and we become like puppets on a string. We have gotten 'drafted' into the more powerful field of the archetypal daemonic energy, as we find ourselves playing a role in a deeper, mythic, divine drama. As long as this divine drama that is enacting itself through us gets acted out unconsciously, it will be played out destructively: this energy becomes truly demonic. And yet, if this energy is recognized, it becomes the source of the greatest inspiration and our highest genius. This is why Jung refers to the daemonic as the not yet realized creative. Like a shaman in the underworld (the unconscious), we are able to alchemically transmute the demons into allies. And once again, the key is consciousness. </p>

<p>I associate to how, psychologically, it is right before the demons get vanquished that they make their worst destructive outbursts.</p>

<h2>A Synchronicity</h2>

<p>Is it mere coincidence that at the exact same time we are at war with terrorism, a new deadly virus, the SARS virus, appears in this waking dream of ours to terrorize us? Seen from the dreaming point of view, this virus is our terrorist process just having changed channels, as it is the same process manifesting in a different form. Like a terrorist, the virus is an 'invisible enemy'. It evokes incredible fear, as it is toxic and can cause death. This virus is seemingly further proof that this is not a safe universe, which just perpetuates the spell, reinforcing the trauma of imagining that we are separate and alien from this universe. Could it be that until we recognize and embrace the terrorist within us, we will continue to dream up a seemingly external agent in one form or another to terrorize us? </p>

<h2>The Continuing Incarnation</h2>

<p>Psychologically, apocalyptic phenomena represent the emergence of the Self, or we could even say the incarnation of God. Talking about Christ as a symbol, Jung says 'He represented a light which, though it shone in the darkness, was not comprehended by the darkness'. Seen as a dreaming process, the incarnation was incomplete, and a further incarnation was needed. </p>

<p>When contemplated as a dreaming phenomenon, the fact that the apocalypse archetype is activated deep inside the human psyche and is playing itself out collectively in this world means that the Self—what some call God—is incarnating not just through one man (like it did through Christ 2000 years ago) but is incarnating through all of humanity. If continued to go unrecognized, this archetypal, daemonic energy acts itself out through us in a destructive way, where —from the dreaming point of view— we all become suicide bombers, since we are killing none other than ourselves. </p>

<p>When contemplated as a dream, the deeper dreaming process is revealing something to us about the nature of the solution of our current crisis. The universe is, literally, primal screaming to be recognized as the higher-dimensionally arranged symbol that it is. To see the deeper pattern that our world is contained in, as well as being informed by, is to snap out of the world of linear causality and realize the world is a living, breathing symbol that we are all mutually dreaming-up together, so as to remind us of this very fact. Like Christ says, 'The kingdom is spread all over and people just don't see it'. </p>

<p>What I am pointing out through words is the 'good news' of the Bible. It's a situation that is playing itself out and already exists and simply needs to be recognized. Our seeing the deeper process that is, in fact, getting played out through us is the very act that radically transforms our entire situation. This is what Christ means in the apocryphal saying, 'Man, if indeed thou knowest what thou doest, thou art blessed; but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and a transgressor of the law'. The implication is that consciousness is the determining factor. If we see and bring consciousness to the deeper process that is enacting itself through us, we receive its gifts; if we don't see it, we act it out unconsciously, and accrue karma. Interestingly, the word evil is etymologically related to the word transgress. </p>

<p>To see the deeper process that is emerging is to recognize that humanity itself plays a key and participatory role in the divine drama of incarnation and redemption, via the act of self-reflection. We become the medium or intermediary through which God reconciles, resolves and reunites the opposites intrinsic to the totality of his/her nature... which includes both light and dark. This is to integrate the darkness that belongs to our totality, as we truly flesh out our full-spectrum hologram, which is what genuine incarnation is all about. These archetypal, daemonic energies then get mediated through the heart and humanized and can be expressed creatively, constructively and with compassion. </p>

<p>God incarnates through humanity, Jung said, '... in order to obtain the jewel which man possesses in his self-reflection. 'To self-reflect is actually a bending backwards and is a privilege born of human freedom, in contradistinction to the compulsion of the daemonic. To self-reflect is a genuinely spiritual act; essentially, the act of becoming conscious. This act of self-reflection, of becoming conscious, registers and effects the entire universe as it gets invested in the collective consciousness of all of humanity. This activates a transformation in the archetypal realm, which results in the incarnation of God through humanity, i.e., the light of consciousness is born. This is why Jung said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'God becomes manifest in the human act of reflection'.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the inner meaning of alchemy, where the ego and the Self mutually, reciprocally redeem one another. The Self becomes humanized (incarnate) and the ego becomes deified (blessed). The boundary dissolves between spirit and matter, as spirit becomes materialized and matter spiritualized. This is the magnum opus (great work) of alchemy, as spirit gets liberated from being imprisoned in matter. The key in alchemy is to have a strong enough hermetically-sealed vessel, or container, in which the alchemical operation can occur. In the case of what is playing out in our world today, the (mystic) alchemical vessel is consciousness itself. </p>

<h2>We Must Be Dreaming</h2>

<p>C. G. Jung was fond of making an analogy between the formation of symbols in the unconscious and the formation of crystals in a saturated solution. For example, if we dissolve sugar in a solution of water, eventually the solution will reach a saturation point. If a single grain of sugar is then added to the solution, a crystalline structure will spontaneously appear in the solution. Any one of us seeing the mirror-like nature of our situation and self-reflecting might be the very grain of sugar that tips the scales, initiating a phase-shift in the collective consciousness of humankind. </p>

<p>Our current planetary situation is clearly one of great instability. Chaos theory points out that times such as these are actually supersensitive situations, much more highly responsive to the smallest change or fluctuation in the system than 'usual'. This literally means that a change in any single individual's consciousness can potentially have an amplified effect on the entire system, in a way that was unimaginable and simply not possible before September 11. </p>

<p>Never before in the history of humankind has consciousness itself been of such importance. </p>

<p>Like a dream, once we stop superimposing our concretized mental constructs upon the canvas of reality and start allowing it to manifest as it truly is, it will reveal its dreamlike nature and resume its revelatory function. Our universe is then recognized to be a continually unfolding oracle whose events are its symbolic script, as it reveals itself to itself, through us. All we need are eyes to <em>see</em>. </p>

<p>One individual having the realization of the symbolic, dreamlike nature of our situation makes it easier and more accessible for others to have the same realization, because we are not separate but are all inter-connected. If enough of us wake up to what is being revealed symbolically, we act as so much yeast in the dough, helping the bread to leaven successfully. Some refer to it as the 'hundredth monkey phenomena'. How many people will it take having this realization to actually make a difference? This is a mystery, but this critical mass is hinted at by the symbolic number 144,000 in the <em>Book of Revelations</em>.</p>

<p>As we realize the dream-up-able nature of our universe, we become conscious of our divine, creative imaginatrix, or what I call our 'sacred power of dreaming'. This is the part of us that is co-dreaming this very universe of ours into materialization. We are all using our God-given sacred power of dreaming 24 hours a day anyway, but we are using it unconsciously, in a way that doesn't serve our highest unfoldment. Let us discover that we can put our sacred power of dreaming together in a way where we can cooperate and collaboratively dream a much more grace-filled dream, in real time, into actual incarnation. This is a revolutionary, radical, epochal and evolutionary quantum leap in human consciousness... unimaginable until this point in our history. </p>

<p>Let us have the mind-blowing realization that the universe is dreaming itself awake through us. Being like a dream, this will only be true if we see it that way. Seeing our life as if it's a dream means that you, dear reader, and I have dreamed up these very words to remind you of this fact. If you tell me that I am only imagining or dream-ing that this is so, I will heave a huge sigh of relief, as you have finally understood. </p>

<p><strong><em>Imagine that!</em></strong></p>

<p>Waking up and becoming lucid inside of a dream is a second order change, where one literally snaps out of a hypnotic trance in which you were identified with being a separate, contracted self, or ego, cut off and disconnected from the rest of the dreamscape. You have an expansion of identity; in full-blown lucidity you realize your identity with not only the entire dream, as it is recognized to be just your own energy projected outwards, but also with the dreamer of the dream — what I call the deeper, dreaming Self — which is who you’ve now discovered yourself to be. The question I want to investigate is, how would you dream the dream onward if you became fully lucid? </p>

<p>When I ask some people this question, they respond by saying they would dream of losing twenty pounds, or getting a million dollars, or something of that nature. I respond by saying that these are all dreams of the smaller self, which is the dream that they’ve now wakened out of by becoming lucid. I remind them that in becoming lucid, they’ve discovered their identity with the deeper, dreaming Self. So the question becomes, how do you imagine this deeper, dreaming Self wants to dream the dream? </p>

<p>Please try and imagine the following as we proceed. You’ve awakened in the dream, becoming enlightened, so to speak, but now that you’ve seen through the illusion of the separate self, you’ve realized that there is no such thing as enlightenment until everybody gets it. For when you become lucid in a dream, the boundary between yourself and others dissolves, as you realize the interconnectedness and non-separation between yourself and everybody else (all six billion others) in the dream. </p>

<p>So many of your fellow dream characters are so asleep, not recognizing the dreamlike nature of their reality; it is as if they have fallen under an enchantment. They’ve become absorbed in the dream and have become so identified with their roles that they’ve forgotten who they are. They are truly suffering a case of mistaken identity. They are all just aspects of you. This is the point where you step into your bodhisattva-nature, as you begin to realize that to be of service to others is to literally help yourself, as who are these others but your own true Self? </p>

<p>Once you’ve become lucid you see that this isn’t a dream that you are just passively watching in a detached way, but a dream in which you are actively participating in and cocreating. You realize that you can consciously step into and cooperate with the dream, helping it unfold to its highest, wherever that may be. This isn’t done from the point of view of the separate, egoic self, whose moment by moment expression is effort-full, straining, and striving, continually strategizing and manipulating the dream so as to fill its imagined sense of lack. This realization stems from a totally different center of one’s psyche, an all-embracing place of fullness, an experience totally unimaginable as long as one is identified with any reference point whatsoever. </p>

<p>Over time, or better yet, when you snap out of the illusion of time itself, you realize that the boundary between dreaming and waking dissolves until you recognize that life itself is the dream from which you are awakening. You begin to have the astonishing realization that the universe is actually dreaming itself awake through us and it takes the most awake and visionary among us to recognize this reality and help further the momentum of the process until it builds up a life of its own. We become agents, or representatives, of this awakening process, as we’ve realized our place in the universal dream, offering our lives in service as a conduit for this incarnating deeper, dreaming Self.</p>

<p>Because we are the evolutionary product of an ancestry stretching back millions of years to an origin in the animal kingdom, many traces of our animal heritage can be found in our physiological and psychological functioning. There is a whole menagerie of animals who emerge during our nocturnal dreaming safaris to the dark continent of our sleeping mind. </p>

<p>What significance should be given to these jungle or domesticated denizens who appear in our dreams? Here are some speculations that have been advanced by various dream theorists: In "The Interpretation of Dreams", Freud proposes that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"wild beasts... represent passionate impulses of which the dreamer is afraid, whether they are his own or those of other people" (1961, p. 410).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ernest Jones, a follower of Freud, says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Analytical experience has shown that the occurrence of animals in a dream regularly indicates a sexual theme, usually an incest one" (1959' p. 70).</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hadfield (1954) suggests that crab, spider and vampire images represent the visceral objectifications of the bodily feelings associated with orgasm. The crab portrays the changes in visceral and abdominal muscles which produce a gripping sensation; the relaxed feelings following orgasm are represented by the sprawling legs and soft underbelly of the spider image; the washed-out feeling of fatigue, as though the blood had been sucked dry, is externalized by a vampire figure. </p>

<p>Jelliffe and Brink noted "the astonishing revelation in psycho-neurotic dreams of the use of animal material" (1917, p. 253). Stekel claims "The danger of approaching insanity expresses itself in dreams of... a sudden attack by a wild beast" (1943, p. 421). Gutheil states "Very often the unconscious is represented by sinister animals" (1960, p.l63). He also proposes that being bitten by an animal may be a symbol of "pangs of conscience". Despert, in discussing the dreams of preschool children, comments "animals as motives are almost always sadistic and often totally destructive, regardless of size, etc. They bite and devour the child or chase him" (1949' p. 141). According to Fodor (1951), being swallowed by a voracious ani mal is a portrayal of our intense fear of birth. </p>

<p>For Jung (1916), animal figures: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"in so far as they do not symbolize merely the libido in general, have a tendency to represent father and mother, father by a bull, mother by a cow".</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freud refers to dreams in which </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"a dreaded father is represented by a beast of prey or dog or wild horse" (1961, p. 41).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a paragraph describing how many specific animals such as snakes, fish and cats are used as genital symbols, Freud states "Small animals and vermin represent small children - for instance, undesired brothers and sisters" (1961, p. 357). Just as Shakespeare used animal analogy as a technique for character 'portrayal (Yoder, 1947), animal figures can be employed to represent various aspects of the dreamer's character. Thus Boss writes "In subjective interpretation a dream tortoise would signify the tortoise-like and armored character of the dreamer himself" (1958, p. 49).</p>

<p>It's obvious that many theoretical views regarding the significance of animal figures in dreams have been advanced. I found these references when I was preparing a book chapter entitled "Animal Figures in Fantasy and Dreams" (1983). That chapter also contains a review of all the research studies where the frequency or type of animal figures in dreams were given. In one study that I carried out, I examined 2,000 dreams of female college students and 2,000 dreams of male college students to discover how often animal figures appeared and which animals were most common. </p>

<p>There were 149 female and 151 male dreams containing at least one animal figure. This represents a frequency of 7.5% for each sex. The ten most common animals for adults were:</p>

<p>If this table is examined, you can see that women were more likely to have mammals in their dreams while men reported more non mammals. Of the total of 194 animal figures in women's dreams, 128 were mammals, 54 were non mammals and 12 were generic animals. Of the total of 203 animal figures in men's dream, 98 were mammals, 92 were non mammals, and 13 were generic animals. </p>

<p>Mammals are biologically and conceptually more similar to humans. Women report more mammals and they also report more human characters than men do in their dreams (Hall and Van de Castle, 1966). In my chapter, I present some evidence to suggest that a higher level of animal phylogenetic (evolutionary) development may be associated with a higher level of social and emotional maturity.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kanimd-2.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I also examined the animal figures in the dreams of 721 children aged 4 - 16 years old. There were 383 girls and 358 boys. My chapter presents frequencies of each animal figure at each year level for girls and boys separately. Animal figures were present in 39.4% of dreams from the four and five year olders and the percentage figure steadily dropped for each subsequent two year age grouping (35.5, 33.6, 29.8, 21.9, 13.7). The latter figure covers a three year grouping from ages 14 - 16. Animal figures appeared in 29.0% of the combined girls' dreams and 29.6% of the combined boys' dreams. </p>

<p>To make a table comparable to that provided for college students, the ten most common animal figures in the combined children's' dreams will be presented (including monsters, where the dream description made it clear that it was an animal or something like a wolfman rather than a human monster):</p>

<p>The girls reported more mammal figures than boys. Of the total of 128 animal figures in girls' dreams, 91 were mammals and 25 were non-mammals. The others were generic and monsters. Of the total of 130 animal figures in boys' dreams, 73 were mammals and 46 were non-mammals.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kanimd-3.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>It can be seen that some types of animal figures are more prevalent in children's dreams. The combination of snakes, bears, monsters, lions, spiders, gorillas, tigers and insects accounted for 34% of the animals in children's dreams, but this same grouping of animals appeared in only 17% of college students' dreams. Children dream more frequently of wild, threatening animals while college students dream more often of pets or domesticated animals. </p>

<p>To obtain a better understanding of the meaning of animal dreams, I performed a contingency analysis, to discover what other elements are present in the dreams where animal figures are represented. I examined 901 dreams (453 from women, 454 from men) of college students in which all the characters were human and compared them to 150 dreams (75 from women, 75 from men) where at least one animal character was present. The presence of animal figures in dreams has a significant effect upon other features of the dream. Dreams with animal figures are more likely to be short, take place in an outdoor setting which is unfamiliar or distorted, have a great deal of activity, often of a violent nature, or be associated with some misfortune. The dreamer experiences apprehension, becomes more sensitized to various parts of his/her body, and exerts some effort to overcome a challenging problem encountered in his/her dream. As the number of animals in the dream increases, all of the features described above become more intensified. </p>

<p>For those dreams where only humans appeared, there are 28 aggressive acts for every 100 characters present, but in dreams where animal figure predominate, there are 56 aggressive acts for every character. If a dreamer is going to have another character initiate some interactional pattern with him/her, there is a 44% chance that friendliness will be received if the other character is a human but only a 4% chance if that character is an animal. In my chapter, I also look at what types of animals are present in 246 dreams from two groups of Australian Aborigines; 118 dreams from natives on South Pacific islands; 190 dreams from North American Indians; and 448 Peruvian dreams. Fish or other forms of aquatic animals were the most frequent type of animal figures for those groups living near water but were almost totally absent in the dreams of inland dwelling groups (Central Australia and Hopi Indians). Snakes were reported fairly often (27 times) by Australian Aborigines and Hopis but never by South Pacific islanders. Kangaroos, wallabies, crocodiles, and stingrays were exclusive to Australian dreams; the only cats were in Truk Island dreams; and the only exotic jungle animals (lion, tiger, elephant) were found in the dreams of Peruvian students. Thus, in preliterate societies, the animals dreamed about are those the dreamer has encountered in daily living, frequently in a hunting or fishing context, while members of a literate society have an almost limitless number of animals available to them for portraying the animal characteristic needed for a particular dream scenario (sly as a fox, strong as an ox, free as a bird, etc.). The particular types of animals we employ in our dreams will clearly be a function of what culturally shared or personally learned associations we have developed regarding particular animal species. </p>

<p>You might find it a useful exercise to examine your dream journal for the types of animal figures that have appeared in your dreams and note what types of feelings, events, and outcomes were associated with these dreams.</p>

<p>The Beatles released their classic album <em>Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Band</em> in 1967. The cover features the song “Lovely Rita Meter Maid” which describes an initial encounter between the singer and a meter maid who is taking his number. Although initially annoyed, he realizes that “it would be better to love her”. In waking reality, Rita has been “taking the number” of the collective dream community and moving about through the streets and byways of our global community to encourage drivers to be mindful of their dreams and evaluate whether they had been parked and inactive for too long a period of time before taking action and getting moving. Anyone lucky enough to have Rita personally “take your number” has definitely come to love her and she has become a legendary, beloved figure among the global dream community for the last quarter century. </p>

<p>I first met Rita in 1983 at a dream retreat workshop held in Batesville, a small community located a few miles outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. Henry Reed and I were conducting this workshop and, besides Rita, another dream appreciator who also participated was Carol Warner. At the conclusion of the workshop, we wanted to gather all of the participants together to take a group photo, but Rita declined because she was extremely sensitive about her personal appearance as the result of having been the victim of a tragic accident in an aerospace lab where she was working that resulted in her undergoing extensive skin grafts over a period of many years. That NDE led to a complete redirection of her energy and becoming a spokesperson for the power of dreams. During the subsequent years, she has maintained a close relationship with Ed Butler, her lab colleague whose precognitive dreams enabled him to instantaneously appear at her side and save her life after her other lab partner had abandoned her and fled from the dangerous situation. </p>

<p>At the conclusion of our Batesville workshop, I encouraged Rita to attend the forthcoming first ASD conference to be held a few month later in San Francisco. and she went to it. It was clear that dreams were an important personal topic for her and she was hoping to meet other individuals who also shared her excitement about the unlimited possibilities of dreams for unlocking human potential. I hosted the subsequent ASD conference at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville the following year. I drafted her to serve as Secretary for our various board meetings and she quickly became an absolutely indispensable component of our organization. In addition to having served as Secretary at that Virginia conference, she has also served as a Conference Host, Chair of the Board, Vice President, President, and Executive Officer of ASD. In addition to being the “connective tissue” for the body of that organization’s activities, she has also served as the organizer for the world’s longest continuing dream group, the Metro DC Dream Community, that she founded in Vienna, Virginia in 1983. Rita has never charged a fee for attending these meetings that she hosts. There is a line in the <em>Lovely Rita</em> song that asks “... where would I be without you?” That’s a good question to ponder for all of us, as the answer might well be ”nowhere”, if she hadn’t continued her rounds of monitoring whether the dream scene was stagnating and inactive or was showing tangible movement. When the singer entices Rita to have tea with him, she turns out to be the one who winds up paying the bill. I’ll let the reader develop that metaphor in their own way. </p>

<p>Rita’s attendance at all our ASD events and board meetings has been exemplary and no one else comes close to having earned as many gold stars for attendance and participation as she has. Rita has also been an advocate for attempting to bring dreams to other settings besides those of the annual conference and has been extremely active in serving as the coordinator for regional dream events held at many locations throughout the country. She has also twice organized weekend programs presented at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC to bring public awareness of dreams to that prestigious setting. She attended the international ASD meetings that were held in Ottawa, London, Leiden and Copenhagen. She quickly established family bonds with all these attendees in foreign countries, and once she has met someone, Rita displays an uncanny ability to later remember their names, names of their family members and the town that they lived in. She is one of those remarkable people who seem to display a “photographic memory” for faces, names and places. Many have entrusted their personal dramas to Rita and people turn to Rita much as they would to Dear Abby’s well known advice column. </p>

<p>I have very many special memories of when Rita and I traveled together to Moscow to attend the “Dreaming in Russia” conference organized by Robbie Bosnak. It was an extraordinary time in history because when we arrived in August, 1991, the former Soviet government was collapsing. We were stunned that we were greeted by the sight of Soviet tanks in the streets and armed soldiers who were standing at guard throughout the city. The plan was to have 50 Russian and 50 American dream representatives share their respective views about how dreams were researched and utilized in our respective cultures. While there, we had no contact with the outside world for several days during the emergency period that was declared. These unusual circumstances offered a wonderful opportunity to interact at much deeper levels with our Russian dreaming cohorts and discover, among many other surprises, how much spiritual emphasis was given to efforts to understand the source of dream imagery. Rita has always been a firm proponent for considering dreams as a vehicle to discover “the interconnection of everything, including angels and all beings, lower or higher.. All parts of creation in this flowing, unfolding universe and perhaps beyond.” She and Rosemary Guiley came up with the idea for a dream activism group following the 9/11 tragedy. A reminder is sent once a month for the purpose of dreaming “the awakened heart.” As Rita explains it, “... this focused intent isn’t just about having good dreams, for all dreams come in service of wholeness and healing, but rather about having dreams that move us to concrete action within the parts of the world in which we reside, waking us up to our personal soul purposes or callings that can improve our world through our works, large or small.” The request made to the group once a month is to “Please join, wherever you live on this planet, aligning spirit, soul and psyche searching for dreams that will awaken our hearts and move us to actions.” </p>

<p>In addition to playing a central role in several online dream groups, Rita has also been active in the annual Cyber Dreaming Conference which has been taking place in early Fall for the last seven years. Approximately 150 dreamers from around the world participate in this two-week event which provides non-stop possibilities for sharing questions and observations about dreams in response to papers written by well known experts in many topics related to psychic dreaming. Rita has teamed up with me for several years to conduct our annual Dream Telepathy contest at our annual ASD conference. She helps to facilitate all aspects of the contest while it is ongoing at the conference, and also writes up an interesting detailed report about many of the impressive dreams which were submitted and their close correspondence to the pictures which served as the target material. Rita herself possesses impressive psychic skills as a dreamer and her “hits” frequently receive prizes for the skills that she demonstrates during the Cyber dreaming contests and are also acknowledged by members of her dream groups. </p>

<p>I felt especially honored when Rita served as the moderator for an address I gave on the topic of Angel Figures in Dreams at one of our ASD conferences. This experience was particularly meaningful to me personally because, of all of the people that I have encountered during my span of 80 years, Rita is certainly the most angelic being that I have ever been privileged to encounter. She exudes warmth, kindness, love, support, understanding, acceptance, and a long list of other positive attributes. Rita is an exceptionally advanced spiritual person who seems to be nourished by an intense inner light that enables her to manifest all of these qualities so steadily and effortlessly. </p>

<p>Her generosity of Spirit is pervasive and extends to every single member of the global community. I don’t know of anyone who has ever dealt with Rita Reincarnation Experiment Website: www.reincarnationexperiment.org The Soul Genome Book at discount on Amazon.com. in any encounter who did not feel the presence of an extraordinary amount of love and compassion. These maternal qualities also expand out to her extended family, including her nine grandchildren. She embodies the archetypal imagery associated with “The Earth Mother” and seems to represent a very wise clan mother who reaches out to and nourishes every member of her dream clan. </p>

<p>I was recently reading some comments that Rita had prepared for Amazon.com for one of the books she had reviewed, <em>She Who Dreams: A Journey Into Healing Through Dreamwork</em> by Wanda Easter Burch. Rita wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“This is a deeply inspiring story of a woman’s brave battle with breast cancer... these stormy seasons of her soul are tempered with an in indomitable will to be healed at all levels of her being. Experiencing surgery and then chemotherapy with its dreadful side effects never stops her from turning to her dreams for help and healing. She recounts dreams, her ways of sharing and working with them and using the wisdom she reaps from them. Tested to her depths, she emerges as a beacon to others, a Wounded Healer whose example offers the greatest hope of all to those of us who face life challenges. Her illness may have stolen her breast, but it didn’t harm the caring heart beating beneath it, nor her sharp mind, nor her glowing spirit... all of which are put to use as she rewrites her life contract and now walks on a new path as a Dream Guide and Dream Bringer to others.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These words used by Rita to describe Wanda’s challenges and how she triumphed through dreams seem to correspond extremely well with the journey that Rita herself traveled after her traumatic encounters when her own body was engulfed in flames in 1959. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Natural disasters have been much in our thoughts the past several years. They are frequently in our dreams. How do we interpret such dreams? Dreams can have multiple meanings and layers of significance. They can be bringing to consciousness one’s deep inner concerns about activities, relationships, and emotions in our personal lives. At the same time they can be speaking about worldwide cultural, economic, and environmental issues. At times they may be warning of possible future events. </p>

<p>In my dream journals, I have found dreams relating to various natural disasters, beginning with some of my earliest recorded dreams. Some describe great flooding or massive snowstorms; others describe struggles to survive after some major, but undefined disaster has struck. In 1994:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am living in a small village or community with my family. Some kind of natural disaster strikes. The whole community becomes buried under water or a blanket of something—maybe a blizzard of snow. We are very fearful and worry about our families and friends. Somehow some of us survive, while others die. Either the water recedes or the snow melts and we begin looking for survivors. I don’t find my daughter anywhere. I look and look and can’t find her. I drive out into the countryside—into a valley searching for her. The dream ends or shifts before I find her.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1998, I had a dream that began:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am in an institutional setting. We learn a major natural disaster is fast approaching. There is no point in trying to leave. We just need to find the safest place within our building.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do these dreams mean? Were they warnings? Expressions of personal concerns? Both? </p>

<p>These and many other dreams pointed to unconscious feelings of being threatened. By 1998, I was conscious not only of my personal concerns but also of a collective concern about the potential dangers resulting from global warming. </p>

<p>Six years later, in 2004, the dangers had not gone away. Two dreams the same night cried out to be noticed. The first dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Apparently something drastic has happened and my family and I are told that we will have to move. The news bearer is apologetic, saying he understands this will be quite a strenuous undertaking for us. I agree that it will be, but I’m resigned to the inevitable. I begin thinking of the need to take only a fraction of our belongings in the move. Next I’m standing on a hillside looking skyward and see a huge transport plane overhead. I’m concerned by how low it is, as it goes from my right to the left. I can see that the plane lands somewhere below, perhaps beside a highway not at an airport. Then, as my family and I drive down from the hill, we see many people standing out on surrounding hillsides looking up expectantly, wondering what is taking place, seemingly waiting for something. We circle around and stop on a level area part way to the valley, then get out and stand watching and waiting, as are the others. I get the feeling that we are waiting for some ‘authority’ to appear below to make pronouncements to the multitudes that are waiting there.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awakened with a feeling of unease, almost an ominous dread, but I managed to go back to sleep; then five hours later I awoke from this dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I have gone into some hotel in an unidentified place to await the arrival of a group of people. At first I’m thinking this group is part of my family, but when they arrive it’s obvious they are unknowns. A woman and at least two men walk into our room. The woman sits on my bed, then gets right up and hastily walks back out. The men follow her and we follow them. As we come up to them I overhear conversation between the men and I catch the word ‘infinity.’ I become concerned. I call my husband to me and tell him I’m worried and ask if he heard what the men were talking about. Did he hear the word ‘infinity’? Yes, he heard and he immediately says it’s their word for the end of the world. This is exactly what has worried me. I take it to mean that they belong to a group that is involved in secret affairs, perhaps something we have read about. I’m alarmed and don’t want to have anything to do with them. After I hear my husband’s response, I leave and return to our room.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first dream of this night recounted a displacement of people similar to what happened during Hurricane Katrina, even to evacuation by means of large planes. Was it a warning of something that could happen in the future? The dream occurred nineteen months before Katrina. </p>

<p>The second dream did not spell out a particular catastrophic event. However, it did point to a deep unconscious fear, one that was growing in my consciousness, of a possible end result of a crisis we are facing. </p>

<p>When I studied my dream journals, I recalled that these two dreams came during a period when I was experiencing some stressful health issues, but nothing as drastic as the scenarios of these dreams. The dreams might be simply exaggerating the anxiety feelings or expressing feelings of lack of control in my personal life. But maybe I am also alarmed about our collective crisis. </p>

<p>Six weeks later I had this dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Other people and I have been preparing to travel somewhere, evidently on foot. We are told that things are going to become ‘impossible’ and some people are giving up. I’m thinking we should at least try to leave and go to a safer place. I tell a female friend I see we should begin our journey; we should try to go as far north as possible. As we begin walking, it begins to rain. We see two people lying on their backs on the ground. They have just given up, thinking it’s no use to try anything to prevent whatever might occur.</em> I wake up, feeling this was an awful dream. It had a feeling of doom, perhaps of the impending end of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the import of these dreams goes beyond the personal level. They seem to be speaking of one of the most serious problems our world faces, the consequences of the damage we humans are inflicting upon the environment. One of my earliest recorded dreams, back in 1972, told of living under difficult conditions after a major disaster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Life is not as we know it now. There must have been some major disaster. People are scattered and having to live under ‘survival’ conditions. I am in a small building with people I don’t know. I see the need to be organized concerning jobs within the building for survival, for rationing and using the food we have. I try to get the other people’s attention to tell them of this need. But they are noisy and won’t listen. We have trouble with various stragglers coming by and wanting to cause trouble. There is also danger from strange animals.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2003 people were still not listening in my dreams: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’ve gone to some building to get out of stormy weather. I find lots of other people there. Someone may question why I’m there. I say I’ve just taken refuge from the weather. I receive a phone call from someone I don’t know. The person has heard of me and is begging me to warn other people about an impending disaster. I ask what s/he is talking about. The person says it’s what was in the newspaper and it will happen in two days. I then remember seeing the item referred to. After getting off the phone, I turn to people near me and try to tell them what was said. No one wants to pay any attention.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in fact it is urgent that we all pay attention. In 2003, the world had just experienced the widespread effects of the Asian tsunami, caused by an undersea earthquake. Shortly before I had this last-mentioned dream, P.M.H. Atwater, researcher and author who has written extensively on near-death experiences, reincarnation, and related phenomena, wrote in an area monthly newspaper the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The island of La Palma in the Canaries north of Africa is separating—three more feet of recent date. An eruption would cause half of the island to fall into the Atlantic Ocean, creating a tsunami wave that would devastate the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, not to mention areas in Canada, Europe, and other countries.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this the article I’m referring to in the dream? </p>

<p>With the breaking off of glaciers and the melting of snow fields worldwide, we will see a rise in sea level that is predicted to flood seaports and coastal areas worldwide in the coming years. This would have the same effect as the potential tsunami Atwater mentioned. </p>

<p>So far, the economic and political leadership in the United States has not taken the threat seriously enough to take the necessary steps to avert this catastrophe, or even to plan how to deal with the situation if it happens. Individual and national greed and desires for short-term benefits and pleasures derived from the damaging environmental practices blind us from seeing the greater long-term suffering. </p>

<p>Al Gore points out in his book <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> the dangers facing the world due to global warming. He is quoted on the back cover of the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In order to face down the danger that is stalking us and move through it, we first have to recognize that we are facing a crisis. So why is it that our leaders seem not to hear such clarion warnings? Are they resisting the truth because they know that the moment they acknowledge it, they will face a moral imperative to act? Is it simply more convenient to ignore warnings? Perhaps, but inconvenient truths do not go away just because they are not seen. Indeed, when they are not responded to, their significance doesn’t diminish; it grows.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently a growing number of people and world leaders have finally begun to pay attention. We are hearing calls for going “Green.” As I write this, Britain’s prime minister is announcing that a “Green Revolution is in the making.” We need to take all possible measures to halt and reverse global warming and its serious consequences. It is my hope that our next governmental leaders will make this one of their top priorities. </p>

<p>Is it too late to avoid all the disasters that are potentially impending? We are seeing some of them now— typhoons hitting Japan, earthquakes in China and elsewhere, floods in the U.S. Midwest, wildfires in California, and devastating hurricanes such as Katrina. This makes it even more urgent that we accept differences between groups (local and world-wide), put aside conflict and war-making, and work together to provide for the basic needs of all. If we don’t, we will sacrifice a viable world for selfish and petty gains. Let us listen to the wisdom of our dreams and act with heartfelt compassion to protect and preserve our planet earth and all its life forms. </p>

<p>I believe, as does dream analyst Jeremy Taylor, that all dreams come to help us in some way. He states that no dream—not even the most terrifying ones—ever come to say: “Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah—you have these problems and you can’t do anything about them!” This means that the dreammaker—the divine within us— believes that if we take seriously this all-important problem, there are things we can do to prevent a catastrophe. We must work together to eliminate toxic substances from all areas of our environment and to find new sustainable and environmentally sound resources, while maintaining the ecological balance of nature, even if it means sacrificing personal and corporate gains. </p>

<p>I believe the dreams I’ve shared are saying, <strong><em>“Wake up, everyone, before it’s too late!”</em></strong> There’s a crisis in the making. Let’s work together to save our world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Many dreamworkers have described the positive values of teaching children about their dreams. Patricia Garfield, Ann Sayre Wiseman, Jill Gregory and others have written on how children can learn in their dreams about their emotions, their fears, their wishes, and their artistic potentials<sup>1</sup>. Yet introducing dreamwork to children has still more values than these: dreamwork can teach children <em>how</em> to think in especially creative, sophisticated ways. Today's children face a future of over-increasing complexity, a future filled with both exciting hopes and frightening dangers. They will need tremendous powers of sensitivity, understanding, and creativity if they are to realize those hopes and overcome those dangers. Teaching dreamwork to children can make a big contribution toward providing them with precisely these powers of thought. </p>

<p>Although dreamworkers do a wide variety of different things with dreams, almost all forms of dreamwork teach a few common mental abilities, a few common ways of thinking: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dreamwork encourages us to appreciate <em>ambiguities</em>, multiple meanings, and the many subtle shades between black and white. Dreams rarely if ever have one simple, sharply defined meaning. The more we work (and play) with dreams, the more we learn to adapt creatively to situations filled with ambiguity and paradox.</p></li>
<li><p>Dreamwork makes us open to <em>surprises</em>, to new and novel situations-it helps us "expect the unexpected". In exploring our dreams we are continuously startled by sudden, unanticipated discoveries. Dreamwork teaches us how to keep our balance when surprising experiences spring up at us.</p></li>
<li><p>It teaches us how to seek <em>resolutions</em> to dilemmas through understanding and patience, instead of through brute force or ostrich-like ignorance. Our dreams often bring us to face upsetting, even frightening, problems in our lives. It is tempting to respond to such problems by angrily fighting against them or by blithely pretending they don't exist. But effective dreamwork teaches us to approach difficult situations with openness, sensitivity, and a willingness to work patiently toward a resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>And, dreamwork makes us more aware of how <em>other people</em> have their own dream worlds. As people share and discuss their dreams with each other, they learn about the unique qualities that unite all people, and also about the wonderfully distinctive characteristics that make each individual human being unique. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now as we consider the kind of world today's children are facing, I would argue that these are the <em>exact qualities</em> they will need to resolve its problems and enjoy its possibilities. The world we are passing along to coming generations will be one of great complexity: extremely different cultures, religions; and races will interact more and more; problems will arise from the convergence of multiple, far-flung causes. New approaches will be necessary, approaches that can adapt to difficult, complicated, and quickly-changing circumstances. </p>

<p>An illustration of how desperately we need to have such abilities for creative thought is the current crisis in the Middle East. The situation there is often referred to as the "first post-cold war crisis", suggesting that it is the kind of dilemma we will frequently face in the future. The U.S. is baffled by all the ambiguities of the Middle East-rather than clear-cut lines we find evershifting sand dunes. We are constantly surprised by events there, caught off guard by changes more sudden than we are able to handle effectively. We agonize over how to resolve the many problems of the region; we seem to be trapped between two awful options-either unleashing the violence of warfare, or surrendering meekly to the injustices of the current situation.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>Perhaps of greatest interest to dreamworkers is how the Middle East crisis has brought to the fore the importance of being able to understand the dream worlds of others. In late October Iraq's President Sadam Hussein reportedly dreamed that the Prophet Mohammed appeared before him and said Iraq's missiles "were pointed in the wrong direction." Commentators in the Middle East speculated that Hussein's dream could suggest that the Iraqi leader is prepared to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. But when U.S. President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was asked for his reaction he said "No comment on dreams. I have enough problem dealing with reality."<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>In a way, this statement sums up our difficulties in facing a crisis as complex and mystifying as that of the Middle East - it seems as strange, as baffling, as unfathomable as a dream. But the harsh truth is that in our world's future such complex crises will be the rule rather than the exception. It seems a matter of simple survival for us and for our children, then, to try and learn how to deal with dreams and with "dream-like" realities. </p>

<p>I am not suggesting, of course, that teaching dreamwork to children would by itself solve the Middle East crisis, Likewise, I would not argue that teaching children to add and subtract would by itself lead to advances in computer technology. But we do teach children elementary math because it provides them with the basic mental abilities that will allow them in the future to work effectively with computers. In just the same way, dreamwork can teach children extremely valuable <em>ways of thinking</em> that will enable them to deal with future problems like those we now face in the Middle East. </p>

<p>The world our children will inherit from us will require enormous resources of creativity, sensitivity, and understanding. Teaching them dreamwork is one of the gifts we can give our children as they step into that world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I left Chicago on Sunday evening, August 18, for the "Dreaming in Russia" conference in Moscow. I was very excited, expecting that the first-ever gathering of Western and Soviet dream explorers would be a fascinating experience. I did not, however, expect that we would suddenly be caught up in a shocking political revolution--for we happened to arrive in Moscow on August 19, <em>the day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt">military coup</a> began</em>. As we drove out of the Moscow airport on Monday afternoon, tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) were streaming into the city. What followed was a roller coaster week of terror, confusion, amazement and, ultimately, joyfulness and hope. </p>

<p>When I returned to the U.S. from the conference, my family and friends said we must not have learned anything about dreams, given all the incredible political events. But when I thought about it, I realized that I did learn a lot about dreams-the Soviet coup itself revealed entirely new dimensions of the dream world to me. For the space of that magical week there was a profound merging of reality, myth and dream. It might sound strange but I believe it was a truly sacred time, in the fullest sense of the word. Ordinary reality was suspended and the most powerful fears, desires and hopes of the human soul emerged, struggling among the desperately constructed barricades and the intimidating lines of huge steel tanks. I've never been in any church or sanctuary that was as overflowing with sacred power as were the cold, wet streets of Moscow during that week. </p>

<p>Myths express sacred power through vivid stories and symbols, dreams reveal that power into our social reality. True political revolutions are the rarest expression of sacred power but also the most explosive. They force us, even more directly than myths and dreams do, to admit that human life is ultimately shaped by powers our rational consciousness does not (yet) fathom. </p>

<p>Now to be honest, these lofty reflections only came to me much later. My first reaction, when we arrived at our conference center just outside the city and heard about the coup, was cool! Totally, totally cool! We're right in the middle of the greatest historical event of the 20th century! Part of me was scared, of course, but part of me was exhilarated. I've been to plenty of dream conferences in my time but never to a military coup! I felt a strong desire to go into Moscow so I could see - and feel - what was happening there. So I joined a small group of people who also wanted to sneak into the city (our Russian organizers had forbidden us from leaving the conference center), and we finally managed to reach the center of Moscow on Wednesday morning, the third day of the coup. </p>

<p>Our first goal was Red Square, the heart of the Soviet government and the control center of the coup leaders. As we rode the Moscow subways, we noticed people clustered around handbills posted on the walls. These were notices from the grassroots resistance movement providing information not available on the heavily censored TV and radio reports. When we left the subways and returned to the street level, we found tanks and APCs everywhere. We tried to reach Red Square, but a line of APCs and soldiers blocked off the intersection in front of us, so we started turning back. But one of our Lithuanian friends (there were three psychology students from the University of Vilnius in our little group) somehow convinced a Red Army soldier to escort us through the APC barrier and over to the other side of the intersection. </p>

<p>It's hard to describe how eerie it felt walking across that big, empty intersection, ominously ringed by heavily-armed military vehicles. The only thing that comes to mind is that it was like walking inside a ritual circle created by a black magician-a sacred space in the sense that it was filled with spiritual power-but a space consecrated to violence, destruction and death. I was very glad to reach the other side of the intersection, squeeze between the APCs, walk through the line of troops and reenter the "normal" space of Moscow's streets. </p>

<p>After getting as close to Red Square as we could, we went to the U.S. Embassy. As we approached the embassy, we saw dozens of crushed, burned-out city buses, surrounded by crowds of people. We learned that the resistance had used the buses to block off the military; however, early that morning tanks had come and smashed through the buses, killing at least three people. We could see the crowd circling around a couple of particular spots. I eased my way in toward one and found it to be a spontaneously created shrine, with icons, prayer candles and a growing pile of fresh flowers. This was the spot where one of the people had been killed. Right nearby the street curb was all broken up, crushed by the grinding weight of the tanks. </p>

<p>We asked the Embassy staff to send messages to our families in the U.S., who we knew could only be imagining the worst about our welfare. When we left, we walked down the hill toward the "White House", the Russian Parliament building where Boris Yeltsin and other Russian national leaders were organizing the resistance to the coup. The scene was one of barely-ordered chaos: the White House was surrounded by huge piles of steel pipes and wood planks, strategically placed clusters of overturned trucks and hundreds of thousands of people waving the Russian national flag. As we stood among the ever-growing crowds at the barricades, we realized that the situation was reaching a crisis point and that perhaps this was a good time for us to beat our retreat. </p>

<p>We rode the train back in awed silence, overwhelmed by everything we'd just seen. But when we reached our conference center, we were met by yet another shock: the coup was over! The military leaders had given up, the tanks and APCs were leaving the city and people were literally dancing on the barricades! The Soviet people at the conference were ecstatic, especially those from Lithuania and Armenia. Their cultures had been violently conquered by U.S.S.R. decades ago and suddenly they were on the road to true independence. I felt very lucky to be with them during such an amazing festival of joy, pride and hope. </p>

<p>Once the coup ended, we were eager to get the dream conference going. There were four main kinds of activities: common lectures, small dream discussion groups, all-group discussion sessions and workshops on dreams and creativity (e.g. dance, theater, sandplay). At each activity there were translators to help bridge the language barriers. The common lectures were OK; I thought the best were by Russian and Armenian scholars who tried to interpret the failed coup in terms of unconscious and archetypal dynamics. The dream discussion groups were a lot of fun! When we share dreams with people from totally different cultures, we realize how important it is to explore what their words, images and concepts mean in their world. The allgroup discussion sessions were not well-received. There were frequent conflicts between the two discussion leaders and the group, and progressively fewer people attended the sessions as the conference went on. </p>

<p>The dreams and creativity workshops were all very interesting. I was in John Lipsky's dream theater workshop and we had a great time creating little dramatic productions from our dreams. It was a perfect activity because it did not require verbal language; instead, we used sounds, motions and facial gestures to share our dreams. </p>

<p>The most joyful and memorable experiences, however, had nothing to do with these formal activities. By far the best part of the conference were the informal conversations in the hallways, at mealtimes, between scheduled activities and after hours at the" magic house" bar. During these more personal encounters we really got to know the Soviet people, to learn about their lives, to share our ideas about dreams and to form new friendships. </p>

<p>The success of the conference was in the way it brought together people from cultures that have demonized each other for, most of this century. Speaking for myself, I've had many dreams over the years in which I've fought against evil, violent Soviet soldiers. It was an incredibly positive experience to meet these people and realize that not only are they warm, caring human beings but also that they share my passion for the world of dreams. My sense was that many people, both Westerners and Soviets, also found the conference to be a powerful experience of healing and integration. </p>

<p>The conference's shortcoming, I thought, was its Jungian bias (the conference was primarily organized by Western Jungian analysts). Jung's dream theories are immensely important, of course, but there's a lot more to contemporary dream studies than Jung. At times I felt like the conference was a Jungian proselytizing mission - like we Westerners were bringing the sacred light of Jungian truth to the dark heathen lands of the Soviet Union. As a result, I fear we may not have shared with the Soviets the full range and diversity of Western approaches to dreams; I also fear we may not have learned as much from the Soviets as we might have. </p>

<p>An interesting aspect of the conference was how the waking world events of the failed coup influenced people's dreaming worlds. Many people said they didn't dream at all during the three days of the coup. A Lithuanian man in my dream discussion group said the waking world was so strange and fantastic that he felt he was dreaming while awake! Others did have dreams that related directly to the coup, for example an American woman - also in my dream group - dreamed during those three days of a disembodied female voice hovering over the resistance movement's barricades in Moscow, encouraging them to struggle on. </p>

<p>I am sure that everyone who attended the conference has different thoughts, feelings and dreams about what went on-all this is nothing more than my own very personal reactions to an incredibly powerful experience. If you want to share others' perspectives, you may want to contact others who attended, like Rita Dwyer, Jane White Lewis, Fred Olson and Dierdre Barrett. You may also contact some of the Soviets as well; many of them asked me to share their addresses, as they are eager to make connections with Westerners interested in dreams. (See pg. 32). </p>

<p>If I took any lesson away from the "Dreaming in Russia" conference, it is this: an idea, shared with the right person at the right time, can create amazingly wonderful, positive, life-affirming effects. Thete are many Soviet people (or, to be more accurate, ex-Soviet people) who are hungering for ideas about dreams - for letters, stories, articles, books, anything we in the West can provide. They have survived a cultural dark age and are now joyously entering a new era of hope and vitality. Each of us can join them in that exciting journey simply by sharing our dreams with them.</p>

  <p><em>"In every dream, whether you are conscious of it while you are dreaming or not, there is some kind of natural phenomenon present. Either it's night and there is a night sky, with or without stars; the sun is shining in the day or it's cloudy; there is a feeling of wind present or not. There is always some kind of natural phenomenon and that is because you cannot dream without the natural phenomenon; it is the nature of things, out of which the dream arises."</em> </p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>From ancient times people have looked to dreams for visions of the divine realms above, and/or the demonic underworld below. But in our time, with our society's pressing environmental troubles, we need to ask a different question of our dreams: what do dreams tell us of <em>this</em> world, the natural world <em>between</em> Heaven and Hades? Can dreams help us heal our wounded, suffering Earth? </p>

<p>Yes they can. In my opinion, we need to listen more carefully to dreamers from non-western cultures, who have always believed that dreams <em>do</em> speak directly to important communal and environmental issues. As recent anthropological studies have shown, indigenous peoples from central and South America, Africa, and Oceania firmly believe that dreams bring forth meanings that are extremely valuable for the community's well-being. They believe that dreams comment on the community's affairs, point to longignored social problems, and offer visions of communal reform, renewal and hope. </p>

<p>We need to realize that the narrow focus on personal, individual meanings is a strictly <em>western</em> view of dreams. Dreams have many, many different dimensions of meaning. Which of those dimensions we discover in our dreams is always determined by the questions we ask of them. If we ask questions about our personal conflicts, that's what we will learn about; but, if we ask questions about the crises facing our culture, we will find that our dreams have much to say about that, also.</p>

<p>Even if we grant that dreams do tell us something about social matters, can they really help us with a problem as massive and intractable as our environmental crisis? The threats of global warming, species extinction, and mounting toxic wastes are tied up with terribly complex political and economic issues; dreamwork, it would seem, is a fly-swatter in comparison to such elephant-sized problems. </p>

<p>Here, we need to listen to what environmentalists themselves say we need to overcome these problems. Most environmentalist action involves lobbying politicians to change laws, protesting against corporate polluters, and trying to develop cleaner, safe technologies. Yet many leading environmentalists admit that these efforts are not enough; they say that we need a deeper, more fundamental change in people's <em>values and attitudes</em> regarding Nature. </p>

<p>Bill McKibben, author of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Nature">The End of Nature</a></em>, says "We must invent nothing less than a new and humbler attitude toward the rest of creation. And we must do it quickly." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Kelly">Petra Kelly</a>, founder of the Green party in West Germany, states "Saving life on Earth requires not only a new way of thinking, but also a new way of feeling. We must work with our minds and with our hearts." And Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in the U.S., insists that "the way to change the assumptions that are destroying the earth is to combine personal transformation with a hard-headed, practical campaign of coalition building, demonstrating and organizing."<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>These environmentalists are all saying, in different ways, the same basic thing: we need, more than anything else, a deep transformation in the basic values and attitudes that guide our society's treatment of the Earth. </p>

<p>My claim is that dreamwork can contribute to this task. Dreams may not help us create new environmental laws or technologies. But, dreams <em>can</em> promote exactly the sort of transformation of moral and spiritual values that environmentalists say we desperately need. Throughout history dreams have been a potent source of new visions, energies, and ideals that have helped people overcome seemingly insoluble problems. Today's dreamworkers have a great opportunity: to help bring the wisdom of dreams to bear on our community's environmental problems.</p>

<p>Little practical research has been done on the specific question of how dreams can promote greater environmental awareness. However, 1 have an example that might help to indicate the potential dreams have in this regard. </p>

<p>Sam LaBudde is a marine biologist with the Earth Island Institute in San Francisco. In 1987 he engaged in a dangerous environmental spy mission: he anonymously took on a job as a mechanic on the <em>Maria Luisa</em>, a Panamanian fishing boat hunting the Pacific for yellowfin tuna. Schools of tuna are frequently accompanied in the ocean by dolphins, and fishermen had long been accused of recklessly slaughtering the dolphins in the process of catching tuna. However, environmentalists had no hard evidence to use against the tuna fishing industry. LaBudde brought a video camera onto the ship, and whenever the crew hauled up its nets, he casually videotaped the ghastly proceedings: scores of dolphins tangled in the mesh, beaks cut, fins broken, drowned in their struggles. Even though he knew the crew would beat or kill him if they discovered his true purpose on the ship, LaBudde managed to collect extensive video footage. When he brought his films back to the U.S., they caused a sensation-they were shown on national newscasts and at congressional hearings, and they helped ignite a public outcry over the tuna fishing industry's environmental practices. </p>

<p>Months after his voyage on the Maria Luisa, LaBudde suffered a recurrent dream: there were "injured dolphins speaking in cryptic tongues"; the dolphins were "bandaged, crutch-ridden, swathed in all the symbols one would expect from a participant or victim of a war." LaBudde says he feels the dreams reflected "stuff I had to bury on the ship because my desire to speak out or do something about the dolphin kills had to be suppressed."</p>

<p>More recently, LaBudde has dreamed of "annihilating representatives of bureaucratic corporate America"; these dreams, he believes, "are a way of purging that which I fail to deal with during my waking states ... [They're] an outlet that helps me resist the urge to become a felon (for the Earth, of course)." </p>

<p>LaBudde's dreams and his understandings of them provide us with some valuable insights into the question of how dreams can contribute to environmental awareness and action. First, his dreams are about environmental problems; the dreams probably have personal, intrapsychic meanings too, but they are certainly speaking directly to our society's environmental crisis. Second, LaBudde's dreams present powerful, moving images of that crisis. The wounded dolphins hobbling on crutches, struggling to communicate is a tragic, strikingly poignant image that haunts LaBudde long after his voyages; the. annihilation of corporate bureaucrats, by contrast, is a wish-fulfilling fantasy that seems to refresh him and clean out his aggressions. </p>

<p>These dreams prompt LaBudde to further environmental action. The dolphin dreams remind him of the dolphins' torment, spurring him to continue fighting on their behalf; the corporate bureaucrat dreams seem to show him that although it might be satisfying to blast these people out of existence, there may be less violent, more <em>effective</em> ways for him to protect the environment.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>People's dreams often bring forth striking natural images-raging storms, fantastic creatures and plants, cataclysmic earthquakes, mysterious caves, fiery volcanoes. Most western interpreters view such images as personal metaphors (e.g. dreaming of an earthquake might mean the dreamer's world is being "shaken up"). But we also need to appreciate how, in another dimension of meaning, these dream images speak to us about our relationship with Nature; they tell us (among other things) that Nature is powerful beyond our reckoning, full of beauty and wonder, and deserving of our respect. </p>

<p>Bill McKibben speaks of the need for a "new and humbler attitude toward the rest of creation" if we are to stop humankind's destruction of the natural world. It can be difficult to cultivate such an attitude in our waking lives where we so easily control and manipulate the environment. Our dreams, though, remind us of our true relationship to the Earth; we are but one species of creatures in the mysterious unfolding of life, an unfolding that can be incredibly joyous, humbling, and beautiful. </p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>What good is dreamwork for people who aren't already committed to environmentalist values? Can dreamwork promote a transformation of values and attitudes <em>throughout</em> our society regarding our treatment of the Earth? </p>

<p>I would respond by pointing to the most crucial, fundamental insight of the environmentalist movement, which is that all life is <em>interconnected</em> - as John Muir said, "when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe".<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Western society has long asserted that humans are <em>separate</em> from the Earth, and that we can use, exploit, and destroy the natural environment however we wish. Environmentalists have worked hard to overturn that view and to make people realize that we are integrally <em>related</em> to all of Nature. But their efforts have met strong resistance from stubborn, tenaciously held attitudes; environmentalists have found it very difficult to create the deep change in values and attitudes that are necessary for a more respectful relationship with the Earth. </p>

<p>Dreamwork can help promote that deep change. Dreams reveal to us how we are fundamentally <em>relational</em> beings. Anyone who explores their dreams learns to appreciate the complex web of relationships that create and sustain our lives. We learn through our dream experiences to appreciate the fundamentally relational nature of life - the countless ways in which our lives depend on healthy, balanced interactions with other people, other psychic forces within ourselves, and with the natural environment. Most importantly, dreamwork promotes this appreciation in a way that goes <em>beyond</em> mere intellectual agreement. Dreams often bring forth truths with great emotional power; thus we may think we understand the important relational quality of our lives, but our dreams can bring that truth home with a strong, primal, transformative force. </p>

<p>What, then, can dreamworkers do <em>practically</em> to cultivate this potential of dreams to change our values and attitudes toward Nature, to help heal our society's relationship with the Earth? </p>

<p>We can focus on images of Nature in dreams and, rather than reducing them to personal metaphors, can treat them as reflections on our treatment of the natural world. We can ask, what does it mean that I often dream of dark, dangerous forests? Does that affect my views of our society's use of natural resources? What about dreams of speeding around in fast cars - does that give any insights into our society's environmentally destructive obsession with automobiles? In dreams where birds, or fish, or rodents are prominent, might those animals be able to tell us something about the needs of Nature? </p>

<p>The crucial point is that we begin trying to ask such questions. Other cultures have always seen their dreams as speaking to their community's relations with Nature; they have regarded dreams as inner manifestations of the same cosmic forces that shape the natural world.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Indeed, it's no coincidence that many Native American tribes have both a profound reverence for Nature and a profound respect for the communal wisdom of their dreams. Now, our culture needs to learn how to listen to this communal wisdom. We must begin to ask how our dreams can guide us in healing our relationship with the Earth.</p>

In short, we also need to ask the question: What can healing the Earth tell us about dreams? While I don't have space in this essay to explore this other side of the dialogue, I would note the following ideas it suggests: that we not use dreams as "raw materials" to be exploited for our individual human desires and that we treat dreams with humility, respect, and reverence.</p></li>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Nightmare_Help.html?id=Y_dEAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y">Nightmare Help, A Guide for Parents and Teachers by Ann Sayre Wiseman</a> (Ten Speed Press, 1989, 128 pp.)</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Every parent knows that all children have nightmares - sleep researcher Dr. Ernest Hartmann notes in his book <em>The Nightmare</em> that young children suffer nightmares more frequently than any other age group. Few parents know, however, what to do when the nightmares come. They try to soothe their panic-stricken child by saying, "It's OK, dear, it was just a dream", but that always sounds hollow: the dream may have been just imagination, but the feelings, the fears, are real. </p>

<p>Anne Sayre Wiseman's <em>Nightmare Help</em> offers a very helpful guide to transforming those fears into opportunities for learning and growth. Wiseman is a grassroots therapist with extensive experience in working with dreams. This book evolved out of workshops she gave at grammar schools in the Boston area, where she helped children from ages 5 to 13 learn to understand their nightmares. <em>Nightmare Help</em> is refreshingly clear of mystifying, technical jargon, as Wiseman intends the book for children as much as for parents/adults. Its large format, friendly style, and numerous drawings (which young readers are encouraged to color) all contribute to this aim. </p>

<p>In the children's section of the book Wiseman says that "dreams can be helpers - and if you dare to look at them, they will teach you about yourself". She then explains that nightmares are special dreams that tell us we're feeling scared, hurt, alone, or angry: "Nightmares are designed to wake you up. Nightmares make you really sit up and listen." Children may want to run away from the scary monsters in their nightmares, but Wiseman tells children that she can show them how to stop being so afraid of those monsters. </p>

<p>Wiseman first has children use colored pens and paper to draw a picture of their nightmare. Drawing a picture allows the child to express the nightmare in a safe way by creating some distance: the nightmare is brought back to mind, but now it's put out there, on the paper. This process gives the child a positive sense of control; it's precisely the experience of utter helplessness and lack of control that is so terrifying in the nightmare. Once the child has drawn the nightmare he or she feels the security necessary to begin exploring the emotions the dream has brought forth. </p>

<p>At this point, Wiseman suggests questions that parents and teachers can ask to guide the child in trying to understand the nightmare. For example, she would ask "How could you feel safe looking at that monster?; Try drawing some helpers to be with you in the picture; Ask what the monster is doing in your dream; Is there anything the monster wants? Draw it in the picture and see what the monster thinks of it". </p>

<p>The bulk of <em>Nightmare Help</em> consists of examples from Wiseman's workshops, and it is here that we see the real value of her work. As she presents the nightmares, the children's drawings, and their own attempts to come to terms with the dreams we begin to see how involved the children become in the process. Their nightmares are matters of the utmost importance to them, and it ends up taking very little prompting from Wiseman for the children to struggle with the troubling feelings raised by the dreams. With her help the children find that what had been terrifying has become an opportunity to learn about themselves. </p>

<p>The process she describes is not a form of dream analysis; no special expertise is required, and there is no dogged sleuthing after hidden symbols. Wiseman's goal is to encourage children to develop a relationship with their dreams. She wants to empower children, to help them understand their own feelings and to learn to live with them. Learning to deal with the fears of their nightmares is a good way for children to begin dealing with the scarier parts of the adult world, Wiseman says. In this respect she is working to revive an age-old tradition of using dreams in education. </p>

<p>Anthropologists have discovered that many other cultures teach their children about the meaning of dreams as a way of teaching them about the world. When adults show that they take their children's dreams seriously, children learn both to take their own scary feelings seriously and to trust the adults whose help they need so much. Parents today would do well to remember this the next time they are tempted to say "It's OK, dear, it's only a dream..."</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The study of history shows that revolutionary developments in human thought spring from surprisingly quiet beginnings, and that the people making the pioneering discoveries rarely recognize the future significance of their work. History also suggests that the full implications of their discoveries become most powerful and most influential on the rest of society only when these people reach, and then cross, a certain threshold; when they begin to share their ideas together, to try and integrate their different findings, and to join with each other in common ventures. </p>

<p>The Civil Rights Movement is a good example of this. While lone writers and activists had been struggling against racism for decades prior to the 1960's, it took the efforts of a dedicated group of people, working together, drawing on the visions of those earlier figures, and addressing the concrete problems of their day, to succeed in abolishing practically all state-sponsored racism and bringing on a new era of equality. </p>

<p>Although having far more humble aims than those of the Civil Rights Movement, I believe that those of us interested in dreams today stand at a similar kind of historical threshold. We are in a position now to look back at the work of the various pioneers in the dream world, to relate their discoveries to each other, and thus to come to new understandings of their value. Further, we now may find that these new understandings raise entirely new questions about dreams that couldn't even be asked before, questions that may become the starting points for our own original explorations. </p>

<p>And still further, if we share our explorations with each other and relate them to the life and problems of our society, our dream studies may uttimately contribute to the solutions of those problems.</p>

<p>But is all this too much to expect from the scattered few of us who take an interest in what many people still view as the chaotic and senseless imaginings of the sleeping mind? Is it too ambitious to suggest that a "Dream Movement" is being born? On the contrary, I believe this is exactly what is happening. We can be likened to the midwives of this birth, helping what was conceived in the seminal efforts of past figures take shape, nurturing its emergence into the present, and guiding it on its way toward a future maturity. </p>

<p>If we play a little bit with this metaphor of today's dream explorers as midwives to the birth of a Dream Movement, we will see that besides describing what is going on, it also points to certain responsibilities that we need to fulfill. </p>

<p>The first responsibility would be to develop a deeper awareness of the history of dream study, dream interpretation, dream art - in short, we need to answer the question, "How have we gotten here?" before we can make any sound decisions about where we're going. And while historical analysis is often a tedious matter, in our case it actually leads to some extremely exciting realizations. Dreams have fascinated humankind from time immemorial - yet the last 90 years or so have seen the most profound and dramatic discoveries about dreams and dreaming ever. Indeed, we are now living in what may confidently be called "The Golden Century of Dreaming." </p>

<p>Beginning in 1900 with Freud's <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> and continuing with Jung's theories of the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the individuation process, the field of dynamic psychology rescued dreams from the contempt of Enlightenment rationalism. It showed that dreams, far from senseless and arbitrary, are coherent, meaningful expressions of the unconscious. </p>

<p>Aserinsky and Kleitman's sleep lab research in the 1950's initiated a series of astounding experimental discoveries, among them the facts that all people dream every night, whether they remember it or not, and that the process of dreaming is crucial for psychological and physiological health. Stephen LaBerge's remarkable studies of just the past ten years into lucid dreaming has shaken conventional understandings of dreams to their very foundations. And more generally, the abundance of anthropological research in recent decades has taught us more about the dream beliefs and practices of different cultures, western and nonwestern, ancient and modern, than has ever been known before. </p>

<p>This is our historical legacy. It is a rich and exciting one - filled with bursts of creative insight and with inspiring suggestions for future journeys. But, it is still a very inchoate, fragmentary legacy. These discoveries have for the most part remained isolated from one another. For example, sleep lab research has generally ignored the dynamic psychologies and their claims that dreams are meaningful; the dynamic psychologies in turn have tended to see the understandings of dreams in other cultures as evidence for their own theories, rather than as legitimate ideas in their own right. </p>

<p>Our first responsibility, that of deepening our historical awareness, thus discloses to us that while we are the heirs to some tremendously creative discoveries, there is also a lack of open, mutual dialogue amongst those who have made these discoveries. Our second responsibility, then, becomes clear; we need to create such a dialogue, to stimulate interactions between the different realms of discovery, and to build up a multi-faceted understanding of dreams which is broader than that available from any single source. </p>

<p>We all know that no dream has only one meaning, and that we best understand a dream by teasing out as many of its subtle and varied meanings as we can. The same principle applies to our understanding of dreams in general. What could the dynamic psychologies learn if they made a concerted effort to introduce lucid dreaming techniques into their therapeutic practices? How might lucid dreamers understand their personal experiences better if they knew more about the similar experiences of other cultures throughout history? How much more insight could we get into the dream theories of those other cultures if we looked at them with the discoveries of sleep lab research in mind? </p>

<p>All of these questions remain just that, questions; a dialogue has yet to develop fully which would be answering them. But it is the generation of such dialogue which transforms a group of loosely related discoveries into a growing, dynamic movement. Again, we have now reached a position where we can make the potential for dialogue among the various fields of dream study a reality. </p>

<p>As we consider the ways in which the original discoveries were made, we see that we have a third responsibility; to remain faithful to our own experiences. Had any of the pioneers of the dream world paid attention only to the reigning theories of their day rather than to their own experiences and intuitions, they would never have discovered the new truths that they did. Likewise, even while we affirm the importance of learning as much as we can about different dream theories and practices, we must be careful to use this knowledge as inspiration and guidance for our own investigations, rather than allowing it to limit us. </p>

<p>At the same time, however, the nature of our interests imposes a special responsibility on us. We are often accused of "navel-gazing," of using our dreams to escape the complex and often painful reality of our day-to-day world. This criticism is unfair, of course, for dreams are in fact a tremendously valuable source of insight into the ills plaguing the social world. But it is true that the relationship of dreams to society is difficult to perceive, and thus we have the important task of illuminating this relationship to the rest of our community. We must show how dreams reveal the roots of many social conflicts, how they point to features of those conflicts that we've been overlooking, and how they suggest possible solutions to problems that have resisted all attempts at rational treatment. </p>

<p>These, then, are some of the responsibilities I believe we have as the "midwives" of the Dream Movement - to develop a deeper awareness of our historical roots, to stimulate an interdisciplinary dialogue, to remain faithful to our own experience, and to relate our efforts to the broader life of the community in which we live. I hope that my mildly normative language has not been offputting to anyone. It's just that I believe that these are the basic principles we will have to try and follow if the potential of the Dream Movement is to be actualized. </p>

<p>But the effort will be worth it, for this potential is truly breathtaking. We are exploring new realms of human nature and human experience never before imagined; we are learning new ways of communicating across cultural and historical boundaries; and we are finding new resources for responding to the problems plaguing our society. What other truths and wonders we will discover, once we join together in our pursuits, can only be dreamed of.</p>

  <p><em>“...Confident of new creation which your dreaming strokes will paint, radiant in its truth and beauty...”</em></p>
  
  <p>Excerpted from the Evening Hymn of Wonder, text and music by Steven R. Janco</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some readers may know of my awakening to the power of dreams when as a young chemist, an experimental rocket fuel exploded in my laboratory, and I was saved from burning to death by a friend and coworker, Ed Butler. He’d dreamt of the mishap several times before it occurred, and in these nightmares, he pulled me from the fiery scene by one foot, the only part of me that wasn’t burning. When he performed this same rescue in waking reality, he cited his dream “rehearsals” as the impetus behind his actions. </p>

<p>That wake-up call led me to many years of studying dreams and learning how to use them practically, both for myself and in service to others. I used to say that I was a convert from outer space to inner space, but have discovered I’m really hooked on both areas of research, for heretical as it might seem to my aerospace colleagues, I believe that both are interconnected, as is all of life. </p>

<p>In the last issue of Dream Network, (Vol. 22, No.1) several articles sketched views of the evolution of the dream movement, mentioning the scarcity of books, materials, and opportunities available back in the 60’s for those who were interested in dreams personally, not professionally. The 70’s brought books for the personal dream appreciator, with Montague Ullman opening up group dreamwork for individual dreamers and the grassroots dream movement finding fertile ground. </p>

<p>Because there were no dream groups in my area, some friends joined me to start the Metro D.C. Dream Community (MDCDC) in late 1983. This group has been meeting continuously since then. MDCDC is open to anyone who wishes to share dreams in a safe environment, no fuss, no fees, just loving support and respect for dreamers and dreams. </p>

<p>In 1984, a dedicated group of California authors and dreamworkers masterminded the first international conference of The Association for the Study of Dreams which I read about in an early edition of Dream Network Bulletin. I attended the conference as a founding life member and became active in the association, filling many roles through the years. These two affiliations, MDCDC and ASD, provided me with my richest learning and an extended dream family. </p>

<p>In the nearly two decades since, dream doors have been opening everywhere, such as burgeoning dream groups throughout the world, including some online, graduate and undergraduate schools offering courses in dream studies, and even more specialized schools granting certificates in dream studies. </p>

<p>We’ve learned that dreams come in service of wholeness and healing at all levels of life and that using them for ourselves or clients are rewarding and commendable occupations, but what’s next? How can we share our knowledge and skills in practical and ethical ways for the good of those individuals who are unaware of the gift of their dreams and of their potential impact upon our current cultural paradigms, as well as upon our suffering planet? </p>

<p>My personal projections and hopes for the evolution of a dream cherishing culture are many and as varied as the skills, talents, and passions individual dreamers bring to light and life. Just as dreams have many levels and are not fully understood unless all are explored, it is my greatest wish that dreams will become honored through all phases of life, from womb to tomb, from nursery schools to nursing homes. </p>

<p>I believe it all begins with education. You know the saying, "Our children are our promise of the future", so beginning with them seems wise. If we teach them at home from their earliest years to share their dreams and to appreciate their creativity, whether through relating, writing or drawing their dreams, our youth will carry these skills through life and to future generations as an heirloom gift that can be opened every night. </p>

<p>Continuing from this early homeschooling, it would my ideal that dream courses be enlarged and enhanced in public and private schools, from the elementary level on up to graduate school, as part of development and enrichment programs, not just courses for psychology majors. As children and young adults garner dreaming skills, we’ll hear more about the use of dream guidance in just about any career or endeavor, for dream life parallels waking life, and a day’s work problem or project will evoke a nighttime response. </p>

<p>Another of my hopes would be to see a renaissance of the use of dreams in spiritual practices within our churches, synagogues, temples, and other spiritual centers. Our materialistic culture has lost sight of its soul and reconnecting with the spiritual power of dreams can only lead to new dimensions of Golden Rule love and caring within society, in turn leading to universal change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We must not forget that the human soul however independently created our philosophy represents it as being inseparable in its birth and in its growth from the universe into which it is born.</em> </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Teilhard de Chardin </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Bringing dreams as sources of intuition and creativity into our working worlds would change the current scientific paradigm which sorely undervalues exceptional dreams, such as those evidencing clairvoyance, telepathy, or precognition. If we could learn to fine-tune these abilities of the dreaming mind, normalizing the so-called paranormal, “Dreaming True” as Robert Moss so brilliantly teaches in his book of the same title, what wonders could be accomplished, what disasters avoided, at work, at home, and in the world at large! </p>

<p>Change may begin with the young, but also could have far reaching consequences for our aging baby boomers and those who care for them. Getting to be on the shady side of sixty, I’ve been asked more frequently to lecture to classes of senior citizens, to those in assisted living centers, and to their caregivers, including HOSPICE workers. Their enthusiasm for working with their dreams is infectious for though they come from generations which didn’t as a rule value dreams, they delight in recounting theirs and finding that they are able to heal past hurts and relive happy memories. Learning to confront the inevitability of death prepares them for a peaceful end-of-life passage. Wouldn’t it be a tremendous service to have a DREAM CORPS of volunteers willing to go into schools, senior centers, nursing homes, and hospitals to talk about and listen to dreams? All it takes is for one person to step out and volunteer, and then another, and another... </p>

<p>Massood, an artist with a website displaying magnificent mandalas, writes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“This site is dedicated to the inherent wholeness, unity and interdependence of all things. With the realization that we share life together as a whole and any isolation or separation is superficial. Mandalas symbolize this archetype of wholeness and tend to appear as a reoccurring theme throughout our lives. For me, their recognition whether in the form of a flower or a galaxy, in my dreams or in various religious or historical sites, has always brought a reassuring feeling of connectedness; that I am part of a whole and one with it.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for me, these mandalas are visual metaphors of individual dreamworkers in communion with each other, each playing a unique and colorful part in the overall creation of healing and wholeness, encircling each other and our globe in harmony, unity and beauty. (visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014152157/http://www.massoodworks.com/">www.massoodworks.com</a>) </p>

<p>An evolving dream cherishing society will certainly be helped along by the Internet explosion which has joined dreamers in active online groups that cross international boundaries and cultural barriers as they share dreams and life experiences. Dreaming consciousness is dipping into the collective unconscious to form links at night, connecting us all in the soft, sweet web of dreams, unraveling our cares and reweaving us as friends and citizens of the dream world, and changing how we perceive waking reality as well. </p>

<p>In the last issue of Dream Network, ASD’s web guru <a href="../@richardwilkerson">Richard Wilkerson</a> gave us challenging predictions about the future of the dream movement, looking beyond the current state of networking in virtual territory to take a peek at the Next Generation. Inroads have been made into this new territory with highly successful results, such as last fall’s ASD PsiberDreaming Conference, the brainchild of PSI wizard, Ed Kellogg. Many volunteer presenters and participants from all over the world convened in virtual reality for a two-week conference, an easy access low-cost interchange of information with opportunities to participate in experiments and to share experiences. The huge success of this premier conference paves the way for future ones on other dream topics, and will undoubtedly bring more dreamworkers into the community which ASD’s past president Robert Van de Castle dubbed the Rainbow Coalition. </p>

<p>A dream cherishing culture will also arise from the groups which are dreaming together for specific purposes to aid our planet and its peoples. For example, following 9/11, dream pioneer Jean Campbell was inspired to create the World Peace Dreams Bridge. In this large diverse group, dreamers have become friends and truly care about each other, fostering projects for peace and creating positive energy through a variety of activities. </p>

<p>Similarly, at the 2002 ASD conference in Boston, Rosemary Ellen Guiley and I led a workshop called, <em>“Dream Activism: Making a Difference in Our World”</em>, based upon our belief that although dreams are personal, for and about ourselves, they are also interpersonal, and provide the power to connect with others in collectively influencing the course of global life. </p>

<p>Though the members of the workshop agreed that there were many ways in which to make the world better, such as fostering peace, ending poverty, ensuring equal rights, etc. , they deliberately formulated a generalized affirmation that would unite them in dreaming for improved world conditions, yet allow them freedom to focus on their own ideas as to how to effect the changes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tonight I dream the awakened heart; tomorrow I awaken the dreaming heart.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream activists join for incubation each month on the night of 10-11th and share their dreams online at www.asd-dream-activism@yahoogroups.com. Scribe Janice Ryalls weaves the dreams into a monthly report and dreamers make further connections. We are convinced that we can make positive change with concrete actions which will raise social consciousness and collective consciousness, promoting shifts in physical reality. Any dreamer who wishes to make a difference in our world is welcome to join us.</p>

<p>Cultural change comes slowly until a critical mass is reached, and if we each do our part, then Teilhard de Chardin’s theory of evolution will be played out with humankind moving towards the “Omega point” of unity. He also believed that love is the most powerful force in the universe. I personally believe that a dream cherishing culture will flourish not just because of advances in technology, but rather through the union of human hearts and dreaming minds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we look into our own hearts and begin to discover </p>
  
  <p>What is confused and what is brilliant, </p>
  
  <p>What is bitter and what is sweet, </p>
  
  <p>It isn’t just ourselves that we’re discovering. </p>
  
  <p>We’re discovering the universe.</p>
  
  <p><em>Pema Chodon</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The School of Metaphysics in Missouri has for the last few decades been researching the role dreaming plays in altering and in reflecting changes in humankind’s consciousness. They state that dreams are an evolutionary gauge for humanity. Let’s rev up the dial, starting tonight!</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><em>I have a dream: that we will again become a society of dreamers. In a dreaming culture, dreams are valued and celebrated. The first business of the day, for most people, is to share dreams and seek to harvest their guidance. The community joins in manifesting the energy and insight of dreams in waking life.</em></p>

<p><em>In a dreaming culture, nobody says, <strong>"It's only a dream"</strong> or <strong>"In your dreams, mister."</strong> It is understood that dreams are both wishes ("I have a dream") and experiences of the soul; that in dreaming, the soul may travel beyond the limits of physical existence and return with gifts from higher realms.</em></p>

<p>Dreaming traditions-like those of Australian Aborigines, Native Americans and early European peoples - recognize that the dreamworld is a real world, possibly more real than much of waking life, in which we often stumble about in the condition of sleepwalkers. In <em>big dreams</em>, we "wake up" to a larger reality.</p>

<p>Dreaming peoples know that one of the central functions of dreaming is to keep us connected to sources of healing, creativity and spiritual insight in an order of reality that is hidden from ordinary perception. </p>

<p>Another of the vital functions of dreaming is to rehearse us for challenges that lie ahead in ordinary life. Dreaming peoples know that we dream the future, maybe all the time. An Iroquois dreamer of my acquaintance says, "Nothing happens until it is dreamed." If you can dream the future, you may also be able to change it for the better by making intelligent use of the information. </p>

<p>If dreams were honored throughout our society, our world would be different. ... and magical. Let me count the ways: </p>

<h2>1. Dream Partners</h2>

<p>Personal relations will be richer, more intimate and creative. There will be less room for pretense and denial. Sharing dreams, we overcome the taboos that prevent us from expressing our real needs and feelings and open ourselves to those of others. </p>

<h2>2. Family life and home entertainment</h2>

<p>"What did you dream?" is the first question asked around the table in a family of dreamers. In our dreaming culture, families everywhere will share dreams and harvest their gifts of story, mutual understanding and healing. Parents will listm to their children's dreams and help them to confront and overcome nightmare terrors. Best of all, they will learn from their children, because kids are wonderful dreamers. This might be bad for TV ratings but it would bring back the precious arts of storytelling, helping us learn to tell our own story (a gift with almost limitless applications) and to recognize the larger story of our lives. </p>

<h2>3. Dream Healing</h2>

<p>In our dreaming culture, dream groups will be a vital part of every clinic, hospital and treatment center and doctors will begin their patient interviews by asking about dreams as well as physical symptoms. Health costs will plummet, because when we listen to our dreams, we receive keys to self-healing. Dreams often alert us to possible health problems long before physical symptoms develop; by heeding those messages, we can sometimes avoid manifesting those symptoms. Dreams give us an impeccable nightly readout on our physical, emotional and spiritual health. Our bodies speak to us through dreams, giving us timely guidance on what we should do (and not do) to keep them well. For example: </p>

<h3>Gloria's Dream Diagnosis</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gloria had suffered for months from painful swelling in the lymph nodes under her arms. She was worried sick about the threat of cancer and insisted that her doctor perform a biopsy after a mammogram was negative. Her doctor then suggested that the swelling could be caused by "cat-scratch fever." Gloria submitted to medication that did nothing to improve her condition. Frustrated, she asked for dream guidance. In the dream that came, <em>she watched someone being fitted with a neck brace, part of a complicated "head apparatus." In the dream, people were laughing at the patient in a way that irritated Gloria; they did not seem to realize that she had fractured her neck.</em> Waking, Gloria could see no connection between her dream and her physical symptoms. But she was goaded to seek a second medical opinion. Her new doctor detected a link between the pain in her arms and a neck problem she had not noticed in waking life. His examination revealed a degenerative disk disease in her neck. When it was treated, the swelling in her arms went away. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>4. The Care of Souls</h2>

<p>As a dreaming culture, we will remember that the causes of dis-ease are spiritual as well as physical. We will use dreams to monitor and rectify energy loss, psychic intrusions and unhealthy relations between the living and the departed. The insights we gain will help to make Asklepian dream healing and shamanic soul work part of mainstream medicine and psychology. </p>

<p>We will work with dreams that alert us to the "energy thieves" in our lives. Linda dreamed that <em>her car kept stalling because someone she knew was draining its battery.</em> She realized that the energy thief was a needy friend and corrected their relationship.</p>

<p>We will use dreams to facilitate soul recovery. In dreams where we encounter a younger version of ourselves, or are drawn back to a scene from childhood, we are brought to recognize a deeper kind of energy loss, that shamans call soul loss. Through trauma or abuse, through addiction or great sadness, we can lose a part of our vital soul energy. So long as it is missing, we are not whole and the gap may be filled by sickness or addiction. Dreams show us what has become of our lost children and when it is timely to call them home. </p>

<h2>5. Dream Incubation</h2>

<p>In a dreaming culture, we will remember to "sleep on it", asking dreams for creative guidance on school assignments, work projects,relationships and whatever challenges are looming in waking life. When we seek dream guidance, we must be ready for answers that go beyond our questions, because the dream source is infinitely deeper and wiser than what Yeats called the "daily trivial mind." </p>

<p>Some of the dreams I have incubated have been watershed events in my life, leading me beyond ego-bound agendas. I once sought dream guidance on a plan to write a commercial thriller, following the formula of a previous bestseller I had published. In my dream, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I entered a luxurious restaurant where a banquet for thousands was about to be served, all in my honor. There was just one problem: the master chef had walked out because he did not like my menu.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got the message: If I chose to repeat myself in pursuit of commercial success, I would part company with the most creative part of myself, my "master chef". I abandoned the book project because of this dream, which brought me the salutary reminder that value must never be confused with market valuation. </p>

<h2>6. Using Dream Radar</h2>

<p>Dreaming, we routinely fold time and space and scout far into the future. In my journals, I have logged hundreds of correspondences between dreams and subsequent events in waking life. </p>

<p>Here are two typical examples: </p>

<h3>Dream #1:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sixty-eight people have enrolled for one of my work-shops. The week-end presents complex challenges, which my dream rehearses in detail. (7/31-8/1/96)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow-up: Just over a year later, sixtyeight people signed up for one of my workshops. The old dream report provided invaluable and specific guidance on challenges that developed in the course of the weekend. (8/28/97) </p>

<h3>Dream #2:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am watching a silly little dog decked out in fake antlers for a Christmas pageant. The dog runs out on the road and is killed but is magically revived by a bizarre character who seemed alien to normal patterns of human behavior. (3/9-10/97)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow-up: The next day, thanks to a missed connection and a change of flights, I found myself watching the in-flight movie on a plane bound for Denver. A silly dog with fake antlers appeared on the screen. The dog was killed on the road and miraculously revived by a low-flying angel played by John Travolta in the movie "Michael." (3/10/97)</p>

<p>I have never seen more time wasted in dreamwork than when we fail to run a simple reality check on dream material to explore the possibility that we have previewed the future. As a dreaming culture, we will work with dream precognition on a daily basis-and develop strategies to revise the possible futures foreseen in dreams for the benefit of ourselves and others. </p>

<h2>7. Building Communities</h2>

<p>When we share dreams with others, we recognize something ofourselves in their experiences. Working with beginners' dream groups, I enjoy the thrill of recognition that travels round the circle as people announce the titles of their dreams . "Naked in public. "Back in school." "Falling." "Snake dance." "My dead mother comes to visit". </p>

<p>Dreaming, we actually find ourselves in the skin and life situations of different people. A Texas woman shared the following dream: </p>

<h3>In A Black Man's Body</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am walking down the street in New Orleans. I notice something different about myself, about my perception of temperature, the way my body hangs. I look down and notice I have very long, muscular legs. A man's legs! And they're black! At this point, I become aware I am dreaming. I am drawn to the smell of wonderful cajun food wafting from a restaurant. A couple of white men block my way, making racist remarks. Someone signals telepathically, "Get out of this place before you succumb to his rage."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Texas woman marveled at the way she found herself inside the mindset of another person. "If we could all have the experience of being in someone else's skin," she told me, "we'd get over our prejudice and preconceptions." I believe she is right. In our dreaming culture, we will build community on the level of soul. </p>

<h2>8. The Art of Dying</h2>

<p>The path of the soul after death, say the Plains Indians, is the same as the path of the soul in dreams - except that after physical death, we won't come back to the same body. Dreamwork is a vital tool in helping the dying to prepare for the conditions of the afterlife. For example:</p>

<h3>Wendy's Waterslide World</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wendy dreamed she was <em>shooting down a slide into an Olympic-size swimming pool, behind her mother. She was happy but puzzled, because in waking life her mother was terrified of the water and had never learned to swim. As Wendy' s mother splashed into the pool, a barrier came down, preventing Wendy from following. When she peered over the barrier, she saw her mother frolicking with a handsome, muscular young man she recognized as her father as he might have looked when he was thirty.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When she shared this dream, Wendy told me she felt her elderly mother was approaching death but was full of fear. Her mother had never shared dreams. "I had the dream my mother should have had." Wendy mused. I suggested she might try recounting the dream to her mother, bring ing out all the happy, sensual detail and see whether in some way she could make it her mother's dream. </p>

<p>Wendy's mother enjoyed this, asking her to retell the dream again and again. A week later, she called in high excitement to report that she had had her own dream of her late husband. He had appeared as a handsome 30-year-old. He told her he lived in a beautiful valley where it was always spring and would be waiting for her when her time came. </p>

<p>In our dreaming culture, dream encounters with the departed will no longer be psychologized away. They will be screened carefully to establish whether they are genuine contacts and whether they contain information that is helpful to either the living or the departed. In the year after my father's death, he came to me repeatedly in dreams with valuable guidance for the family, including practical and specific information to which I did not have access in waking life. Sometimes (as Jung observed) the departed seem to need help from the living, especially when they have become lost or confused, frequently because they are not aware that they are "dead." Active dreamers will develop the ability to dialogue with these spirits and help them find their right path. </p>

<h2>9. Walking the Path of Soul</h2>

<p>The greatest gift of dreaming is that it facilitates an encounter between the little self and the big Self. Active dreaming is a vital form of <em>soul remembering</em>... of reclaiming knowledge that belonged to us, on the levels of soul and spirit, before we entered this life experience. So much of the harm we do to ourselves and others stems from the fact that we have forgotten <em>who we are</em> and what we are meant to become. Dreaming, we remember... and encounter authentic spiritual guides who will help us on our paths. I remember vividly how I was taught by a vision guide who first appeared to me during a life-threatening illness in early childhood that all true knowledge is <em>anamnesis</em>, the act of remembering.</p>

<p>Dreaming, we remember our kinship with all living things and the Earth that sustains us. Dreaming we walk between worlds and remember that our spirits are starborn. As a society of dreamers, we will participate actively in the emergence of a more gifted and generous version of our species: the multidimensional human. We will come to re-vision our world of physical extension and linear time from a higher dimension and operate (sleeping or waking) in a state of multiple consciousness. We will treat others with greater compassion, knowing that we are all related and face the surface events in our lives with greater courage and generosity, knowing that they are only part of a much bigger story. </p>

<p>Creating a dreaming culture is not science fiction. It is a possible future that all dreamers can help bring into manifestation, because <em>we all dream</em> and because there are times when dreams will push through even the most hardened carapace of skepticism or materialism. Without preaching, without shouting, all of us who value dreams can give others a safe space in which to start sharing their own inner experiences. The encounter may come at a bus-stop, in a supermarket, in line at the post office or around the kitchen table, with a total stranger or a close relative who is opening up for the first time.</p>

<p>We can give those who are just beginning to share their dreams the gift of <em>validation</em>: confirmation that they are not alone, that they are not going crazy, that their dreams are not "only" dreams. We can encourage every dreamer to claim her own power, by recognizing her as the final authority on her own dreams. Without setting ourselves up as experts, we can offer the insights of frequent fliers. We can share what real dreamers know: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>We are born to fly, and in dreams we remember the soul has wings.</em></strong></p>

  <p><em>I can feel a yearning to make a place for hearing our dreams and their poetry, a place for the "re-enchantment" of the world. To have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the times to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world.</em> -Psyche Speaks, pgs. 88-89</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I recently attended a gathering of Northwest Coast Native tribes on one of the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, which, in essence, was a celebration of cultural revival and a sharing of Visions through storytelling, song and dance. I was able to see with vivid clarity - as regards dreams that come for community, that are intended to be shared on that level with others - how that's creativly integrated in Native American culture. It's also helped me to see the abject poverty of our culture in this respect. We simply don't provide enough places for the 'enacting' of the dream to occur at this time.</p>

<p>I perceive, from the materials and information that come to the matrix of the Dream Network, that there is a growing desire among the general population to engage more seriously in their dreams; the satisfaction of that urge is trying to be satisfied in a variety of ways. It seems to me that what we have happening now in terms of <em>where</em> people can go with their dreams, is to private therapy with depth, transpersonal and Jungian therapists, like yourself... to dream groups or to the many individuals who cluster around the philosophy espoused by this publication... which, in essence, says that dreams are a common human experience and we do not need to rely, exclusively, on professional help to engage with our dreams and to integrate our dreams into our lives and culture. </p>

<p>I'd like now to go directly to a quote from your book, Psyche Speaks, which stimulated the request for this interview: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"To have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the times to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given your statement and given that we are demonstrating a collective, cultural urge - or impulse - toward 'enacting and incarnating psyche in the world' - how do we go about creating that bridge into the home, the community, our schools... from your perspective? What are the safest ways to bring psyche's voice 'into the world'? How can we achieve this in ways that are creative, healing and not destructive.. given that we are talking about reopening considerable repression of emotions and... soul? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> The issues that are involved are so large and in many ways so crucial, that it's difficult to know quite where to start. </p>

<p>There's a great distrust of dreams; there has been forever, to one degree or another. Dreams, I think, are relatively subversive and so they are likely to be a threat in many different ways to whatever is the established order... whether that is the established order of the personality, or of a group, or of the larger collective of society. From my point of view, almost every dream has more to do with the future than with the past. Since most individuals, groups and societies function in a preservative mode, preserving a sense of self, of identity, a sense of collective identity... there's not a lot of tolerance for anything that has the capacity to question or overthrow whatever is the established process.</p>

<p>In my mind, dreams have that function. Not just the occasional collective - or 'Big'- dream that some people have, but every dream has the potential of being a source of the future. And of course, most of the ways of working with dreams have to do with attempts to understand the dream in terms of the past. </p>

<p>A lot of good work can be done that way; it's not that I'm questioning the value of that. What I do question is whether that work serves the dream. There is no question that dreams can be used in different ways and they can be used as vehicles to work and re-work the past. I think any work that tends to do that exclusively <em>fails the dream</em>, and so I am particularly interested in how to approach the dream in ways that will listen for what the intentionality of the dream is, in terms of the future. We can't do anything about the past, anyway; we can do very little about the present. The only thing we have hope of doing something about that is different than just being determined by the past is the future. So, the future, not being known, forces- I think - a certain way of listening to the dream that is not from the standpoint of knowledge, authority, understanding and so on... but, simply listening to what the dream has to say. </p>

<p>Now that sounds very simple but, in fact, it is very difficult, because most of our attempts- whether on our own or working with someone else- tend to force the dream into some understanding that we already have. And, of course, it's much easier to pull the dream into some constructive understanding than it is to truly listen to the voice of the dream. True listening has the potential for reorganizing our whole psychology and sense of ourselves. Dreams have that potential, but it's anxiety provoking to open yourself that fully to a dream and so there are a lot of reasons for trying to bring understanding to the dream, which amounts, very often, to forcing the dream into already preconceived notions. </p>

<p>That effort of listening to the dream- and particularly to its intentionality, to its "future seeking" value-I'm not sure that is the preserve of the professionals at all. Nor am I sure whether professionals are necessarily the best people to be listening in this way. Artists listen in this way. Poets listen in this way. Perhaps I should say some artists and poets. And so these activities- art and poetry- tend to be the places where you can see what's heard that's anticipating the future, more so than what you see in professional journals. If you look closely at what's happening in some art, what's happening in some poetry and some literature, what's happening in some of these creative processes... then you can start seeing the future in a way much more clearly than you can in what is presented as overt plans for the future. Our 'plans' for the future don't work nearly as well as some of the anticipations that one sees in art and poetry. </p>

<p>One can see these anticipations of the future, as well, in the dreams and visions of people in different kinds of psychotic conditions, and in certain kinds of extreme human conditions, in certain extremity conditions altogether. And most of these things get seen as illnesses, or as problems, or only as reflecting problems... problems to be fixed, problems to be coped with or adapted to, etc. So, it's hardly surprising that where there are sources of power - whether that's political or financial power - the dream is hardly listened to in such places. </p>

<p>I think, in the present world, the dynamics of money are probably the main determinant of most of what transpires. And for that reason, it seems significant to me that I can make a great deal of money interpreting or working with people's dreams in the ways that I do. And I know a whole lot of people who can make a whole lot of money doing that. </p>

<p>But, I can't make any money from a dream. Nobody's going to pay me for a dream. If I tried to sell you a dream, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I tried to sell you a poem, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I try to sell you a dream that I think is important, that somebody just told me, you wouldn't buy it. And yet, these are the most valuable things we have. And nobody knows it. It's not that I want to be paid for my dreams; I don't. And I don't want to sell dreams. But in many ways, I believe that dreams are the most valuable things that we have and I would hope that the pervasiveness of money dynamics - as it seems to be developing in our culture - doesn't find a way to commodify dreams. </p>

<p>There are dreams that I have heard which I think people need to hear. One of the things I want to do is to try and make some kind of place for such dreams, so that these dreams can be heard. I want to do that in some way which is not going to be influenced by the dollar; I don't know how to accomplish that but it's a project I have in mind. I don't want to interpret these dreams; I don't want to write a professional or Jungian commentary about those dreams. I could surely do that, but I don't want to. I want the dreams to be heard. I would like, somehow, for the dreams to be heard all over the place! </p>

<p>So, some of the things that are going on, because of the computer network, the global highways, the ways we are able now to instantly communicate with vast numbers of people, I want to be able to use it. I don't want to sit back and just say that's horrible, because it's not. I do want to make use of computer technology as a way and means for the psyche to be heard. I think that psyche is going to be heard, in any event. The problem is whether we can hear it and get the message... or have the message forced on us. </p>

<p>The psyche doesn't stand for not being heard for very long, whether that's in an individual's life, a group's life or a culture's life. The kind of community that can be generated from genuinely hearing what's going on in the psyche is an extraordinary community. This doesn't have to be in the same place, geographically, because we're not in the same place geographically anymore. That idea is I gone. Your real community in the future is going to be with you in Utah, me in Lake Stevens, X in Nova Scotia and Y in New Zealand and somehow we are going to be able to communicate and be an organic community, even though we're not in the same place. Finding ways of facilitating that sense of community is going to be a very interesting thing to do. </p>

<p>I feel more in community with people I've never met, never seen, who are in Europe, or in Russia or South Africa, than I do with my neighbor across the road. And I can have two reactions about that: I can say that's horrible, we've got to have community right around us; but, what I've come to feel is that I don't want to insist on that anymore. First of all it's not happening organically. What is happening organically is a kind of psychic inner connection with people all over the world and I feel very connected with them. </p>

<p>Certainly, I'm not in opposition to having community close at hand in my small town, but it doesn't seem to · be happening. I don't know whether that's peculiar to me or...</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I don't believe so. I'm hearing everywhere I go that there is no such thing as community anymore, except when a crisis occurs. I am experiencing it myself. It's a great loss, whatever the causes. I wasn't I aware of how much I miss a sense of community until attending the gathering I mentioned earlier. The setting was on an island in British Columbia. There, most people do not have, nor need, cars. Every day was a celebration of people in the streets, walking and genuinely greeting one another. That in itself was incredibly nourishing and made me painfully nostalgic because that's the way it used to be... </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I'm a strong believer in the <em>organicity</em> of community. The way in which community is genuinely formed is not to press the idea of community by saying we've got to have community and kind of force it in some way. That doesn't work. Community doesn't even mean that if you think about the word. The <em>munis</em> part of that word means "gift"; the <em>comm</em> part of it means "together." So community that is organically based is based on <em>what we give</em> to each other. When you give something to another person and that gift starts circulating - that's the key thing: the circulation of gifts - then, you have community. </p>

<p>Now, where does that happen? It certainly can happen with your next door neighbor, but it often doesn't. That's why now, what I can give, is to people that are not necessarily next door. The person next door doesn't I necessarily want what I have to give and if I give it to them it doesn't circulate, it stops. So, what's required is to give in a place where the gift will keep moving. </p>

<p>Louis Hyde, in his book The Gift, a crucial book in this whole sense of things, pointed out one problem with the early Puritans is that when the Indians would give them the peace pipe, the Puritan would put it on his mantel. The gift became a <em>possession</em>. When the Indian came by the next time and saw the pipe still there, he took it. So, Indians became "Indian givers"; "you can't trust an Indian."</p>

<p>But, what the Indian was seeing was the death of community and that was very disturbing. The Indian understood that if everyone takes and possesses, we don't have community, we have power. That acquisitive power aspect, when we are in that mode, we can't give and therefore, we can't be a basis of community but only a basis of power. Communities that are based on power - that attend to the flux of power - are quite different than communities based on the flux of gifts. This is probably the most crucial thing in terms of how to find out where community is in the modern world. </p>

<p>This is why I think with the kinds of technological communication - which is, of course, the same word that this is going to make possible a vast interaction of everybody in the world ... and communities are going to be quite different than what we've imagined them to be in the past. I had a dream some years ago, one of those voice dreams, you know, that has a compelling truth quality. It said, "God is in the computer."</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> That's an awesome statement to consider. A dream voice once said to an acquaintance: "The unconscious is God." </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> It's important to notice the dream does not say the computer is God, it says God is in the computer. Now there are certainly ways in which computers function as gods, lately. You go into the bank, and if the computer's not working, nothing is happening. They can't even do anything by hand anymore. So, the computer is sort of god there. I just read a book recently called <em>The Death of Money</em>, which gives a good picture of what happens when computers a reconceived of as god and instead of the dollar bill now being god, it's electronic money that has become god. </p>

<p>Now, that's not quite the same as what my dream was saying. Because of that dream, I haven't been able to look away from what's happening in all the technological revolution, because if I trust the dream I have to trust the idea that God's in there. If God is in there, in the computer, then there's a certain sense in which the computer is a new church... or is the place where one might find God.</p>

<p>This helps me in my relationship to technology and all the things that are coming in technology. In fact, the revolution in technology, which has been based largely on processes of miniaturization, has had the corresponding effect of increasing the power of individuals. The effects of this will escalate dramatically. It's happened within the last twenty years, for the most part. It has basically rendered the idea of countries, governments, large power blocks... as being relatively ineffective, in comparison with the power of individuals. Even economically, the power of individuals is increasing. It is now possible to create wealth more quickly with the idea an individual has than organizing large masses of machinery or materials or such things. A single idea, now, can produce more wealth almost instantly than a generation of 'stuff!' </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Stuff... from the Industrial era? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> That "stuff" was characteristic of the industrial era and now we are changing into an information era. It's a knowledge revolution and knowledge is really the basis of power. You can't bomb knowledge. Once all the factories and means of production become robotized anyway, there's not going to be much point in bombing them. The whole idea of large bombs is going away and with it, of course, what it has supported. The huge global structures of war are becoming obsolete. We are in the process of seeing the obsolescence of large scale governments and, of course, in the process of that there is total chaos! That, coupled with the breakdown of what <em>has</em> contained so much, historically - institutions, traditions and so forth - leads to the present chaos. This situation, I think, often generates a kind of nostalgia and so we're trying to put things back together the way they were and... </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> They won't fit!</p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Exactly... and there's no going back. That going back is also related to trying to relate to the dream by dealing with it with what we already know. The past. I'm not so sure that embracing the future works by embracing the past. I don't think, for example, that the means of understanding the coming times are necessarily going to come by trying to interpret it in terms of what's already past. </p>

<p>Using, for example, Greek mythology. Greek mythology was the stories of the Greeks as the psyche was then producing stories and art. Why would we want to take just those stories and say these are the stories of the psyche when the <em>psyche is producing stories all of the time.</em> New stories, different stories. Obviously, some with the same themes... but in new contexts. It's more a point, now, of trying to sensitize ourselves to what is coming and how to embrace the future, rather than being fearful about it. These things that are being developed are the tools of the future and like any tool, you can hit somebody over the head with it or you can do something creative with it. </p>

<p>So, the problem we have is still the same problem. We have to have a kind of psychological development that is up to the development of the tools, or we're going to have a massive problem. And this, I think, is probably the source of much of the problem: the disparity between where the tools and the power are and where most people are. Many people in the world are still living 200 or maybe 2000 years ago. Living 10 years ago is dangerous to your health! D</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I would like to get some clarifications for <em>Dream Network</em> readers on what you've said so far because you are introducing some new, timely and viable ways of looking at things. You are saying that we must listen to the dream as a way of embracing the future. Do you include all dreams?</p>

<p>There are now people who are identifying different <em>types</em> of dreams... such as precognitive dreams being those which show us a future event or condition ... but I hear you saying that you are listening as though all dreams are giving us guidance into future time. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. What I would like to propose is that all dreams, regardless of their seemingly different types, are ways into the future, are preparing for the future. This is something I'm in the process of working on in a book I'm currently writing. It may seem a bit odd as a way of looki ng at the dream but conceiving the dream this way brings up the question of how one is to relate to the dream and, again, putting things in an extreme form as a way of making a point, all dreams are to be enacted. Now that seems a bit dangerous and radical... </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> And challenging! </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. Some might say stupid. If you have a dream that you go over and kill your neighbor, does that mean you go over and kill yo ur neighbor? Is that what I mean by enacting? Obviously, that's not what I mean. Talking about every dream as having something to do with the future, does not mean that one becomes a slave and simply act out the dream. There's a world of difference between acting out and enacting and this is the crucial point. Enacting the dream requires <em>consciousness</em>. A conscious relationship to the dream, a kind of eros with the dream. This is totally absent when one is simply acting out the dream. And that's the chief difference between what one might see as a dangerous suggestion... that one just go act out what the image of the dream has shown. That's not enacting the dream at all. At the same time, when the dream pictures you killing your neighbor, what do you suppose it could possibly be to enact such a dream? What would that look like? What would you do? </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> First of all, make a determination about what the dream means. Who is the neighbor? What does the neighbor symbolize? If one were to look at the neighbor subjectively, he or she would no doubt be showing some aspect of oneself that needs to be disposed of. If looked at objectively - if there is, in fact, a serious problem with the neighbor, some righteous conflict resolution appears to be in order. </p>

<p>I understand what you are asking. I encounter this all the time... peole who are so inclined toward the quick explanation, toward the literal interpretation of dreams. That's one danger we face, it seems, as more people become interested, considering that by far the majority of people will not or cannot access someone who is in a professional capacity. The concern becomes how to educate, how to get the information out, in order that people are led to the quality resources, to the right information. This, so that we may begin doing what really is <em>simple and intuitive</em>, but since we have been deprived of - and are just in the process of reclaiming - this precious side of our nature, it becomes a considerable and sometimes lengthy process. Providing quality information, education and resources are joyful and immense responsibilities for all of us who are involved. </p>

<p>Before I ask the next question, I'd like to reflect a bit on what you've been sharing. First, I totally agree that we are in a position, maybe for the first time... maybe... in the history of the human species on this planet, where we really don't have any precedents in history - even yesterday - which can help us move into tomorrow, into the future. What you are introducing is a new concept, that we must begin recognizing that the time for reaching into the past - into the places where the woundings have occurred - need, now, to become those transformative experiences which become our personal mythology. Those which can carry us into the creation of a new way. It seems that this is our challenge... in the midst of the present-day chaos. </p>

<p>You have indicated, in response to the question of psyche's voice being heard in the world, that the kind of messages we're receiving from psyche, those that are ready to be heard out in the world, are the dreams that don't want or need to be interpreted. Are you saying that if is the dreams, which Jung referred to as coming from the level of the collective unconscious, that are ready to be heard ? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Let me say a couple of things about this. I would like to say that every dream needs to be heard. What I mean first of all is that the dreamer needs to hear the dream. The dreamer needs to listen to what the dream is saying. That's the first place of hearing is the dream. A lot of people don't hear their dreams, so, there's a whole part of a person's life that they're not hearing. There is a collective task to get people hearing their dreams. I encourage everyone to listen to their dreams... so, that's the first place of hearing and it's very deficient at the moment. </p>

<p>As many people as are interested in dreams, or who are in therapy at this time, there is really very little of it going on in the world. That's the first place of hearing that needs to be animated. I mean, we compulsively go to the TV or the movies or whatever and we already have a theater going on inside us all the time. And it's free! It's one of the few things that the economy hasn't quite insinuated itself into, as yet. Although, in many ways it is, because we are so distracted by the economics of TV and movies and everybody's desperately involved in those things, when there's a whole source of such things going on inside that doesn't cost a dime! </p>

<p>So, there's that first place of hearing. Every dream needs to be heard. That creates the channel, as it were, for the objective psyche, or the divine or whatever one wants to call it, to come in. I don't care what one calls it, there is something there to be heard from. No matter how prosaic any dream seems, it's the beginning of a hearing of <em>something else</em> and it's that something else that needs to be heard. </p>

<p>I wouId go so far as to say every dream needs to be told. And how do you tell it? Well, first of all, you have to <em>tell it to yourself</em>. Just hearing it is one thing but telling it to yourself is another. And by telling, here, I mean an act of consciousness with the dream that has certain features. One must <em>really become curious</em> about the images of the dream. That one goes into the dream again, perhaps imagining or allowing the dream to work on us in our waking life, not just in our sleeping life but in our waking life and allowing it to work on us in such a way - what Jung called "Dreaming the dream onward," or technically, active imagination, which itself is a very difficult thing to achieve. Basically, the idea is that it's a way of <em>participating in the dream consciously</em>. It is an act of consciousness of taking oneself into the dream world again and being there, but being there with consciousness now. That's another step one takes with the dream. There are many steps. </p>

<p>One can make something from the dream, manifest the dream somehow in the world. Even the dream where one kills one's neighbor. If the dreamer were to paint this image of killing the neighbor, I can guarantee you that things would start stirring that s/he didn't know were there... that s/he needs to know are there, for their future. To enact the dream in a painting and let the paining speak to us and let all the actions that are involved in painting speak to us... brings up all sorts of things that are the stuff of our future. </p>

<p>So, there are many ways of enacting the dream and many ways of telling the dream. Telling our dreams to our partners ... and I don't mean 'dumping' the dream... I don't mean saying the dream to someone else as if they're then supposed to do something with it. We can't really tell the dream until we've heard the dream as fully as possible. </p>

<p>If we dream and wake up and tell our partner... nothing has happened. We haven't heard the dream deeply enough in order to tell it deeply enough. We've just put it on a conveyer belt and sent it along. That's not what I mean by telling a dream. Hearing is a very deep inner process and telling from that place of hearing so deeply about any dream, it has an inductive effect on the other person. It's related to the kind of art, for example, when we see it, it produces the urge to paint or to write-not the urge to possess - but the urge to create. When art has that effect, then art is serving its purpose for the future. It's bringing the fruit of the future by doing that. Our dreams are the same way. Putting a dream on a conveyer belt and sending it out, that's not what I mean. If we hear it deeply enough and tell from that deep place, then we induce an erotic connection to the other. That kind of telling is very erotic and it is what makes for very deep relationship. </p>

<p>A community that comes from that kind of sharing, giving the gift of a dream to another... after one has heard it as deeply as possible... to me, that is the idea I sequence of things in bringing the dream to the world. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> In that way it relates to the community of giving that you were referring to earlier. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. And so, I think that the age of Aquarius being upon us, it's useful to use the imagery of Aquarius as being characteristic of what this might mean. Aquarius is a waterbearer. It is not quite clear whether Aquarius is male or female and so gender is not so much an issue. The issue is the bringing of the water. What I imagine this to be - and where the dream is the vehicle - is that, opening ourselves as deeply as possible to the other is the way we can fill the jug. Then, we take that jug to the common pool and we pour that jug into that calm pool made of these pourings of each of us. That is the water of community. Our gift to the common pool. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Sounds like soul food to me! </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Soul food it is. Dreams are free and they have to be freely given. The community that generates out of that, the gift giving of that, is going to be something we've never seen before.</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> It reminds me of what Kilton Stewart brought to us about the Senoi people. I recognize that what Stewart shared has been questioned. .. but the paradigm is viable. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I don't care whether Kilton Stewart's work is a fantasy! The ideas are psychologically correct. They are good images for what is necessary in the times to come. That we go to that place of psyche and bring from there the gift to the community. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> So be it. Thank you, Russell.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>If we could fold time, travel forward a century or two and then look backward, I believe we would find abundant confirmation that the rise of the dreamwork movement is one of the most important developments of the modern era.</p>

<p>In my brighter vision of what is to come, our society will be guided by dream helpers who are dreaming with and for the Earth itself. Their constant work is to help those around them to use dreams for guidance and healing, as a direct line to the God/Goddess we can talk to. Dream helpers play a central role in health care; now it is recognized that dreams diagnose problems before they manifest and that dream imagery and conscious interactive dreaming offer vital tools for healing. Dreamworkers help the dying to prepare for the afterlife journey by following the path of the soul in dreams; in this way they learn to go through the swing-door of death with confidence and grace. In the workplace, the day begins with dream leaders helping colleagues to share their dreams and to grow community visions. In our schools, our children become storytellers, communicators and creators by sharing and giving creative expression to dreams, and get credits for doing this. </p>

<p>In this happy future, dream guides are valued because they midwife creativity and healing. Above all because it is understood that they help us to connect with soul and recognize that this is vital to our survival as an evolving species in balance with our environment. Dream travelers are respected because it is now common knowledge that they have direct access to the flux of consciousness that particle physicists found to lie at the heart of matter—more specifically, to the ‘hidden’ six or seven dimensions of the multiverse identified by superstring theory, even before the end of the 20th century. </p>

<p>In my darker vision of what is to come, I see dream travelers and dreamworkers helping to rebuild our world after a catastrophe. In spontaneous dreams and visions over many years, I have found myself traveling into a possible future in which an order of priestess-scientists are trying to repair the havoc caused by the ignorance and violence of men of power who did not listen to dreams. The dream priestesses of the future have perfected the arts of community dreaming and group dream travel, and have been able to access immense sources of energy and knowledge at the heart of subatomic space. Dreaming, they reach out to educate and inspire those who will help humanity to find its way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a recent dream, <em>I found myself voyaging into the world of the Kogi, a dreaming people who live on a sacred mountain in Colombia and succeeded in isolating themselves from the outside world until the 1980s. I made my dream journey to the Kogi at the invitation of a friend who had spent many months with them and had brought me a personal message from one of their shamanpriests. I met a being who showed himself first as a giant bird, then as a man in a conical hat. I saw vivid scenes of his people on the mountain they regard as the heart of the world. Then he opened a vision gate for me, inside the dream. To my surprise, I found myself looking at seemingly ordinary, middleclass Americans going about their daily business. I was catapulted into the mind of one of them and I was horrified. Here was a decent family man, trying to do his best, in utter ignorance of what is happening to the forests and the seas, of the psychic forces that breed hatred and violence, and of the nature of the soul. In that moment, I understood the immense cost of our Western ignorance, from the point of view of an indigenous dreaming people. And I knew that the return of the dreaming ways is the antidote.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreamworkers may follow many different approaches to dreams, but by my observation they agree on the following: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dreams are important! </p></li>
<li><p>The only ‘expert’ on a dream is the dreamer. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreams connect us to sources of guidance that are wiser than the everyday mind. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreamers should help each other, wherever possible, to open a safe and sacred space where dreams can be shared and the dreamer can be offered non-intrusive feedback and guided to take appropriate action to honor the dream. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreaming is for the community as well as the individual. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>We need many more dream helpers from all walks of life, contributing a panoply of rich and varied perspectives, personalities and life experiences, to bring the gifts of dreaming to people where they live. </p>

<p>The next step, it seems to me, is very simple, and hugely important. If we are going to become a dreaming society again, we need ways to make it easy and safe — and fun — to share dreams with other people anywhere, anytime. Our first service to others, as dream helpers, is to confirm and validate other people’s dream experiences, and to encourage them to claim the full power and energy of their dreams. And we need to be able to do this in the thick of the hurry-sickness and manifold distractions of contemporary life. </p>

<h2>Lightning Dreamwork</h2>

<p>Over many years of teaching and practice, I have evolved the simple and powerful method for everyday dream sharing that I call <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em>. Like lightning, it is very fast and it focuses extraordinary energy. In the workshops, we allow just 8 minutes for the whole process to be applied to a single dream. This does not mean that we can’t spend an hour — or a day — with a dream when we have time and the dream invites that depth of exploration. It does mean that when we use this process we always have time to share our dreams, no matter how busy our lives may be. </p>

<p>The <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em> process makes it possible to share dreams and receive helpful feedback just about anywhere: in the office, the E.R., at the family breakfast table or in the checkout line at the supermarket. The guidelines make it easy to share dreams with complete strangers or with intimate friends and family. </p>

<p>This process incorporates the ‘if-it-were-my-dream’ protocol for commenting on someone else’s dream developed by Montague Ullman, which has been a tremendous gift to dreamworkers all over the map.</p>

<p>There are four key steps in the Lightning Dreamwork process. I have written the instructions as if you are working one-on-one with the dream. In a dream circle, one member would play ‘lead partner’ in guiding the process, with the others contributing their suggestions and associations in the ‘if-it-were-my-dream’ phase. </p>

<h2>Step One: Telling the Dream as a Story with a Title</h2>

<p>The dreamer tells the dream as simply and clearly as possible. The dreamer should always be encouraged to leave out his/her autobiography, and tell the dream as a story, complete in itself. When we do this, we claim our power as storytellers and communicators. We also avoid the appearance of giving a license to others to probe into our personal lives, which must never be permitted in dream sharing. The dreamer should be encouraged to give the dream a title. It’s amazing how the deeper meaning and shape of dream experiences jump into high relief when we do this. </p>

<h2>Step Two: The Partner Asks The 3 Vital Questions</h2>

<p>If the dreamer has forgotten to give the dream a title, the partner should ask him/her to make one up. The next step is for the partner to ask three key questions: </p>

<h3>Question 1: How did you feel when you woke up?</h3>

<p>The dreamer’s first emotional reactions to the dream are vital guidance on the basic quality of the dream and its relative urgency.</p>

<h3>Question 2: Reality check</h3>

<p>The reality-check question is designed to establish whether the dream reflects situations in waking life, including things that might manifest in the future. Dreams often contain advisories about the possible future, and it is important not to miss these messages. By running a reality check, we help to clarify whether a dream is primarily (a) literal (b) symbolic or (c) an experience in a separate reality. In practice, the dreamer may need to ask several specific reality check questions focusing on specific elements in the dream. Here are a couple of broadbrush reality-check questions that can be applied to just about any dream: - Do you recognize any of the people or elements in the dream in waking life? - Could any of the events in this dream possibly happen in the future? </p>

<h3>Question 3: What would you like to know about this dream?</h3>

<p>This simple question to the dreamer provides a clear focus for the next step. </p>

<h2>Step Three: Playing the ‘If it were My Dream’ Game</h2>

<p>The partner tells the dreamer, ‘If it were my dream, I would think about such-and-such,’ The partner is now free to bring in any associations, feelings or memories the dream arouses, including dreams of their own that may contain similar themes. Often we understand other people’s dreams best when we can relate them to our own dream experiences. </p>

<p>It is very rewarding to receive a totally different perspective on a dream, so sharing in this way with strangers can be amazingly rich, as long as the rules of the game are respected. One of those ironclad rules is that we never presume to tell someone else what a dream means for them; we say only what it would mean for us, if it were our dream. </p>

<h2>Step Four: Taking Action to Honor the Dream</h2>

<p>Finally the partner says to the dreamer, “How are you going to honor this dream?”... or “How are you going to act on the guidance of this dream?” Dreams require action! If we do not do something with our dreams in waking life, we miss out on the magic. Real magic consists of bringing something through from a deeper reality into our physical lives, which is why active dreaming is a way of natural magic ñ but only if we take the necessary action to bring the magic through. Keeping a dream journal and sharing dreams on a regular basis are important ways of honoring dreams and the powers that speak through dreams. But we need to do more. </p>

<p>Turn a dream into a bumper sticker. This is always helpful. When we write a personal motto from a dream, we not only distil its teaching; we begin to bring its energy through. Create from a dream: turn the dream into a story or poem. Draw from it, paint from it, turn it into a comic strip take a physical action to celebrate an element in the dream, such as wearing the color that was featured in the dream, traveling to a place from the dream, making a phone call to an old friend who showed up in the dream use an object or create a dream talisman to hold the energy of the dream: A stone or crystal may be a good place to hold the energy of a dream, and return to it. Perform the dream through spontaneous dance or theatre use the dream as a travel advisory: If the dream appears to contain guidance on a future situation, carry it with you as a personal travel advisory. Go back into the dream to clarify details, dialogue with a dream character, explore the larger reality and have marvelous fun! In my workshops, we practice dream re-entry with the aid of shamanic drumming and enter each other’s dreamspace (with permission!) as trackers, to support the dreamer’s journey and to bring through additional guidance. Share the dream with someone who may need the information. </p>

<h2>To the Place of the Heart</h2>

<p>Sharing dreams in this way opens paths to limitless adventure and healing. Once we have mastered the Lightning Dreamwork process, we can play the role of dream helpers and dream ambassadors (quite literally) on any street corner. </p>

<p>We soon find that dreams bring us, and can bring our communities, back to the place of the heart. When I was teaching in California in October 2002, I found myself in a dream that made this very clear: </p>

<h2>Mountain Lion Pulls Me Up to the Place of the Heart</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am climbing a steep cliff, carrying a small white box. The cliff is hard to scale, but someone at the top lowers a beaded strap to me. When I grasp it, I am startled to see that the other end is held by a mountain lion. The mountain lion pulls me up, immensely higher than I had expected, until I am on a lofty peak with a commanding view over the coastline and nearby towns and forests. Now the lion directs me to open the box, and I take out a beating red heart. When I place it on a boulder at the summit, the heart beats steadily and powerfully. I know that the heartbeat is reaching people across a great distance. I feel the heartbeat shepherding them towards healing rhythms in their lives, and recalling them to the wisdom of the heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shared this dream with a circle I was leading. We did more than discuss it. We agreed to travel inside it, in a conscious group journey assisted by shamanic drumming. We climbed the mountain to receive healing and guidance in the realm of the animal guardians and the place of the heart. The heart center is where we find courage, and reconnect with what truly matters. Our role, as dream helpers, is to encourage each other to go there, and move beyond our conflict and confusion to the heart of the world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>This historic meeting took place on June 16 and 17, 1984 at the Metropolitan Club in San Francisco, California. Approximately 125 persons from all areas of the country and from such widespread geographical locations as Ecuador, Belgium and Japan attended. </p>

<p>On the evening prior to the convention, Gayle Delaney and her husband, Steve Walsh, served as hosts for an informal reception at their home. After the Saturday morning program opened with a welcome by Dr. Gayle Delaney in her role as the President of the ASD, presenters gave papers on dreams and insight, the importance of dreams in psychotherapy, definition dream analysis, lucid dreams, dreams and synchronicity, and dreamwork in educational settings. The day's events ended with the keynote presentation of 160 slides by Dr. Van de Castle. </p>

<p>On Sunday, the papers dealt with archetypal dream work, innovations in community dream work, dreams in the Christian tradition, dream reflections and creative writing, the perceptanalytic dream system, dreams and the shamanistic tradition and anthropological studies of the dream. The final presentation was by Dr. Henry Reed on dream realization. </p>

<p>The long lunch breaks and Saturday supper time provided an opportunity for participants to exchange viewpoints about the papers or personal experiences with dreams. Near the conclusion of the convention, audience input was invited regarding reactions to the convention and suggestions were requested about the format for next years convention. Before closing, Gayle thanked her large crew of volunteers, the conventioneers thanked Gayle, and gave her a standing ovation in appreciation of her diligent efforts to get the convention organized. </p>

<p>Then Melodie sang a beautiful a capella dream song and the group silently held hands in a circle. Participants reluctantly left amid promises to renew the many newly discovered friendships they had developed when the next ASD convention gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia. </p>

<p>The next ASD conference will be held June 19-23, 1985 at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia. Participants will be housed in inexpensive, air-conditioned dorm suites on the beautiful West Lawn of the original grounds designed by Thomas Jefferson. Plans are being developed to include a wide range of research, clinical and theoretical papers as well as discussion panels during the daytime program. The evening programs will offer opportunities for small group meetings to share in educational and brief experiential workshops. Large scale dream induction and telepathic studies involving all interested persons are also being planned. Books on dreams and other educational materials such as tv tapes will be available and there will be a display of dream-inspired creative products (art, sculpture, etc.). </p>

<p>There will be pre-convention one and two day experiential workshops offered by a variety of leaders such as Henry Reed, Bob Van de Castle, Gayle Delaney, Stephron Williams, and Monte Ullman. There will be a welcoming party on Wednesday evening before the convention officially opens on Thursday morning. It would be helpful in estimating projected attendance if persons who think they might attend would drop a postcard indicating their interest or intent to the arrangements chairman:</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The traditional dream teachings of India can offer dreamworkers of the West exciting and thought-provoking new ideas regarding the nature, function, and potential uses of dreams. India has one of the richest and most vital cultures in the world - a culture which, rather than crumbling in the face of "progress", is reacting to the West as it has to many other empires throughout history, by absorbing the foreign elements into its own flourishing world. The people of India have had a long and deep interest in dreams, with the first writing about dreams coming in 1200 b.c. in the sacred Hindu text the Rig-Veda. These remarkable people can tell us much about the mysterious experiences of our sleeping selves. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, little study has been done so far on this subject. However, the few sources on Indian understandings of dreams we do have are highly suggestive, revealing views very different from those generally accepted in the West. </p>

<p>In 1984 Wendy D. O'Flaherty published <em>Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities</em>, a wonderfully entertaining discussion of the myths, stories, and theories about dreams in India and in the West<sup>1</sup>. She begins the book by noting how one of the most intense mythic experiences is that of suddenly falling into confusion about what is real and what is not. Dreams are one of the major sources of this experience, O'Flaherty finds, and she says that in myths and teachings about dreams we can see expressions of how people have tried to understand our most basic relations to reality. </p>

<p>To defend against this type of confusion Western philosophy and psychology have tended to draw sharp lines between "hard" and "soft" reality, and thus have defined waking life as "real" and dreams as "illusory." But O'Flaherty says that in India these distinctions are not built up so quickly, and the ambiguities are not ironed out so anxiously. If two ideas clash, Indians believe that "both may be true." In India waking life is not the only reality, nor are dreams entirely - the truth lies somewhere in between. </p>

<p>Many of the myths about dreams which O'Flaherty examines express the important Indian doctrine of "maya". While maya is often translated as "illusion," O'Flaherty argues that this is not quite accurate: "To say that the universe is an illusion (maya) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made." She points out how the same verb in Sanskrit (Srj) means "to dream" as well as "to create" or "to emit". Dreams in India are seen as revealing this fact of maya to us, the fact that life is neither real nor unreal but is instead best understood as continual projection, as something being ever newly created, transformed, metamorphized. </p>

<p>O'Flaherty recounts the variety of lively myths and stories about dreams in Indian culture - the romantic adventures of travelling through the dream world for surreptitious liaisons with beautiful princes or princesses; the confusing tales of dreamers discovering that they are actually parts of other people's dreams; and the legends of dreams containing portents and omens for the future which come true. O'Flaherty suggests that these stories reveal how Indians reject any fixed boundaries to reality. Indians conclude that "what we must settle for instead are tendencies, directions of movement, and processes of reality and unreality." Dreams in India are not disparaged as illusory nonsense best forgotten upon wakening, but are rather revered as valuable symbols illuminating the deepest truths about reality. </p>

<p>Another fascinating glimpse into the world of dreams in India comes in the book Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors (1982), by Sudhir Kakar<sup>2</sup>. Kakar's unique background makes this work particularly interesting. He was born in India, came to the West to be trained as a psychoanalyst, and then returned to India to practice psychoanalysis and to study and compare the healing traditions of East and West.</p>

<p>One of the stories Kakar tells in his book is about a young Indian man named Sundar who comes to Kakar complaining of frequent quasi-epileptic attacks. Since the attacks have no apparent physical cause, Kakar begins asking about Sundar's family relations. Sundar describes a recurrent dream he has had since childhood: "I am sleeping on my bed when a shadow attacks me. I fight against the shadow but fall down from the bed. My mother picks me up. When I wake up I feel tense, as if I have been in a fight." Kakar interprets the dream as expressing a guilty rage Sundar feels toward his father combined with an oedipal attachment to his mother. But when Kakar presses him for further details, Sundar is seized by attack, the session ends and Sundar soon breaks off the analysis. </p>

<p>Sundar turns for help to one of India's numerous traditional healers, a poor, aged Muslim named Baba. Kakar portrays Baba as a wise, sensitive and good-natured man who, despite his filthy mosque "office" and his rather eccentric behavior, has tremendous healing talents. </p>

<p>When Sundar arrives Baba asks his standard opening question to his visitors: "What do you see in your dreams?" As Sundar hesitates, Baba continues, "Do you see a woman, a man, a child, a snake or a monkey or any wild animal in your dreams?" Sundar tells of his recurrent dream. "Aha, the shadow is a bala (a demon) that is attacking you", Baba confidently announces. He takes a bottle of water, recites some Koranic verses over it, and tells Sundar to drink a little of the water every day. Sundar's attacks rapidly decrease in frequency, and Kakar concludes with admirable humility, "as far as a quick cure of this particular patient's symptoms is concerned, I must admit that the score stands: demonology, 1; psychology, 0." </p>

<p>What should we make of this story? Kakar tries to defend his diagnosis by asserting that, despite Baba's "intuitive, unconscious awareness of a dream's symbolic significance," the holy water worked only because it symbolically purified Sundar's oedipal guilt and rage. </p>

<p>However, I believe the differences run deeper than this. Kakar (and Freudian psychoanalysis in general) sees both dreams and psychosomatic symptoms as devious masks concealing unconscious urges. In Sundar's case this urge is his oedipus complex. But Baba recognizes that dreams may try to express meaning rather than to hide it. When Kakar asks Sundar about his troubles, Sundar tells of his dream; Kakar's psychoanalytic interpretation fails to answer the unconscious expression, so Sundar's attack tries to communicate it more strongly - the attack says, "No, that's not what I mean, this is!" Sundar goes to Baba, and Baba does understand the dream. He answers symbol with symbol, speaking back to the dream in its own language - "Aha, a bala is attacking you" - and now that true communication with Sundar's unconscious has been established his problems can be cured. </p>

<p>In Kakar's book, then, we have a picture of a vigorous dream therapy tradition in present-day India more than holding its own against the West; in O'Flaherty we trace India's fascination with dreams back through thousands of years of myths and stories. O'Flaherty discusses how dreams in India are believed to illuminate profound truths about ultimate reality, while Kakar looks at the ways Indians use dreams to deal with personal problems in daily living. </p>

<p>The intriguing hints in these two books can only make us more eager to explore the strange but insightful understandings of dreams in India. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>The word "myth" has been tainted by common usage in which it has come to refer to a falsehood. This is unfortunate for each of us as individuals and for society in general. Rather than being judged as "true" or "false," mythology can be best thought of as a way of making sense of reality - an interpretive tool. As such, a myth can be judged only insofar as it is functional or dysfunctional for positive growth and development at a particular point in time for a given individual, family, or group. </p>

<p>Just as each culture organizes reality according to its mythology, each individual also views his or her life through a unique mythological lens. As we move through life, we are called upon to update our basic mythological understanding of the world. Accepting that our conceptions of reality are mythical in nature makes it easier for us to revise and reformulate old ways of thinking rather than to feel pressured to defend outdated views. Our personal mythologies, therefore, are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>

<p>We can think of our personal mythology as including all the interacting and sometimes conflicting thoughts and feelings we consciously and unconsciously have about our world. These thoughts and feelings shape our comprehension of what the world is and of our place in it, and they help determine the actions we will take as we live our lives. Although our myths do not always engage our conscious mind, they are always intimately affecting our lives. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it. Because dreams appear to synthesize one's existing mythic structures with the data of one's life experiences, any incongruity between these elements is often presented to us in dream content. It appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>

<p>Indeed, personal myths appear to form in a manner that is parallel to the way dreams develop. We can hypothesize that personal myths and dreams are both related to the brain's propensity for language and narrative structure. Humans have often been described as "meaning-seeking animals." Our personal myths may be a way for us to find meaningful structure in our experience, while dreams perform the same function with the torrent of images and feelings welling up from the unconscious every night. As Montague Ullman has written, "Our dreams serve as corrective lenses which, if we learn to use them properly, enable us to see ourselves and the world about us with less distortion and with greater accuracy." The same can be said of our personal mythology. </p>

<p>Since our personal mythology has its roots in the ways we learned to make sense of our world during childhood, there is frequently a conflict in one's personal mythology which is affecting one's feelings, thoughts or behavior. A mythic crisis is apparent in regard to personal development. This crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. When this occurs, the psyche is in conflict as each competing myth becomes a psychological entity attempting to dominate particular situations with its particular modes of perceiving and responding. </p>

<p>While personal myths shape our awareness, they themselves operate largely outside of ordinary consciousness. It is possible, however, to willfully bring many aspects of our personal mythology into our awareness. Because it is the nature of dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of behavior dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness. Awakening to the mythic dimension of our lives is to achieve the freedom to inspect and revise that wh ich for most people controls them unaware. </p>

<p>We can develop a categorization system which describes several aspects of dreams in this ongoing dialectic. A particular dream may include one or more of the aspects outlined below. For people who have learned to understand inner events in terms of personal mythology, this can be a useful framework for understanding their dreams. </p>

<p>• The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>emphasizing past experiences which provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li>

<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth</li>

<li>providing visions of a future dominated by the old myth - a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.</li>

</ol>

<p>• Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>

<li>interpreting new experiences in this manner and/or accommodating the old myth to fit new experiences in a manner that corresponds more closely to the counter-myth;</li>

<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities; while inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>

</ol>

<p>• The dream may facilitate a cognitive integration between the two myths. As ongoing experiences bring the two toward a compromise, they become more compatible, an integration of essential elements of each becomes possible, and the cognitive forces that work against conflict begin to integrate the two myths. This process is suggested in dreams which:</p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>highlight experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li>

<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experiences and show ways of resolving it;</li>

<li>portent a future where the conflict is resolved, often instructing us in how to accomplish the resolution.</li>

</ol>

<p>Feeling tone often gives a clue as to the function of the dream. "Old myth" dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining in terms of energy and vitality. "Counter-myth" dreams typically tend to feel hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating. "Integration" dreams tend to produce a calm positive, realistic feeling. </p>

<p>In summary, dreams can play an important role in presenting the personal mythic structure to the dreamer. Dreams can itemize each aspect of our personal mythology and can point out when an old personal myth has become inadequate for life's current issues. The dream can point out when personal myths have become outdated, can provide a dialectical encounter between old and new myths, and can mediate conflicts between myths even providing new mythic structures and facilitating synthesis. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>In <a href="../bcpov6kmyth1">Part 1 of this article</a> (Dream Network, Vol. 17 No. 3), we presented some concepts and techniques you can use to recognize several different types of dreams and to understand what they might be suggesting about the evolution of your personal mythology. In Part II, we will demonstrate how some of these techniques might be applied using as our example a dream report contained in a popular song by The Beatles: "A Day in the Life." But before we begin the dream appreciation, allow us a brief recapitulation of the basic points we covered in the first part of this article. </p>

<p>Our personal mythologies are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>

<p>A mythic crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it.

Indeed, it appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>

<p>Because it is the nature of many dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of beha vior, dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness.</p>

<p>A particular dream may include one or more of the following aspects: The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>

<ol type="a">

<li>emphasizing past experiences which formerly provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li> 

<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth;</li>  

<li>providing glimpses of a future dominated by the old myth-a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.

</li> 

</ol>

<p>Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner, providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>

<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities. While inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>

</ol>

<p>Or, the dream may facilitate a cognitive-effective integration between the two myths (the previously existing old myth and the new counter-myth). This process is suggested in dreams that:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>feature experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li> 

<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experience and show ways of resolving it; or</li>  

<li>portend a future where the conflict is resolved, often hinting at ways in which the dreamer might accomplish the resolution.</li>

</ol>

<p>Finally, feeling tone often gives an important clue as to the function of the dream. Old myth dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining. Counter-myth dreams typically have a hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating tone. And integration dreams generally feel calm, positive and realistic. </p>

<p>Now let's take a look at how we might apply some of these concepts to an actual dream report. We're going to assume that the vast majority of our readers are familiar with the Beatles (in fact, we're going to assume that you have a copy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8">"A Day in the Life"</a> that you can now listen to). As you're listening to the song, notice that you are being led through a dreamscape. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I read the news today oh boy, About a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad, Well I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good place to begin is with the feeling tone of the dream (especially in this case, as the music provides us with a very tangible expression of the emotional context). What is the overall emotional sense we get from this dream? The voice is distant; it is detached from the scene being described, which is a tragic car accident. Notice the disconnect between the sadness of the news and the dreamer's reaction "well I just had to laugh... " </p>

<p>Leonard Bernstein once reportedly told an interviewer that this song was the most brilliant five minutes of music written since World War II. Indeed, what other piece of music so perfectly captures the strange, self-contained logic of a dream in which even the most unlikely juxtapositions appear to make perfect sense? The next scene is similar to the car accident in that it is a scene of tragedy. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I saw a film today, oh boy. The English army had just won the war."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen to Lennon's intonation of 'oh boy.' The weary boredom in his voice is far removed from the enthusiasm this phrase brings to mind! This stanza seems to be referring to the famous films of the concentration camps made at the end of World War II, truly some of the most horrific film of the century. It isn't surprising that, 'A crowd of people turned away.' For them, it was too terrible to watch. But our anesthetized dreamer doesn't turn away... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"But I just had to look, Having read the book."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here again we have the perfect statement of the dreamer's distance from all that he is witnessing. As in the first scene, his reaction is somehow justified by having experienced an artificial depiction of the event. In the first sequence, he 'just had to laugh' because he'd seen the photograph. In this case, he 'just had to look' because he'd read the book. </p>

<p>At this point, the song takes us into a swirling orchestral tumult which ends with the ringing of an alarm clock. Then, "Woke up, fell out of bed, Dragged a comb across my head..." The music has changed completely (as has the voice, from Lennon's to McCartney's). What had been remote and unconcerned is now matter-of-fact and busy. For the rest of this stanza, we are led through the morning ritual: the tea, being late, grabbing the coat and hat, almost missing the bus, having a first cigarette... But then somebody speaks, our guide drifts off into another dream and we are once again in the parallel-world where traffic fatalities can be funny, and war can be nothing more than a curiosity. </p>

<p>What can we conclude about the import of this dream? In terms of the feeling tone, it seems that this is an old myth dream. Both music and voice are voi d of emotion. There is a sense of dissociation from everything being experienced. Even expressions that are used specifically to convey emotion-"oh boy"-are delivered utterly empty. </p>

<p>Nothing that we see in the content of the dream suggests that a counter-myth is being offered or strengthened, nor does there seem to be a process of integration taking place. Rather, it seems that our guide is dreaming of daily experiences (the traffic accident involving a member of the House of Lords, corning across a documentary about World War II being shown in a public place) that could easily lead to a challenge to his current personal mythology. But he is apparently not yet ready to generate a counter-myth to replace his old, entrenched myth. This dream seems to be performing the second function of the old myth type: 'resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth.' </p>

<p>And yet, it seems our dreamer is on the cusp of a true crisis in his personal mythology. This crisis is suggested in the vast distance his dream suggests he feels between himself and his experience, as well as by the fact that the assimilation of these experiences seems provisional, at best. It is certainly a forced assimilation when tragedy has become funny, and evidence of extreme human cruelty evokes nothing beyond mild interest. The dream is so inappropriately devoid of emotion, so empty and lonely, that one cannot help but feel that it is a call for help of some kind. Such numbness can only be the result of extreme pain, and the extremity of this pain may presage a breakthrough into a counter-myth scenario, perhaps in another dream. </p>

<p>We hope that this example has been helpful in clarifying a few of the concepts and techniques one can use in dream appreciation. We would welcome other opinions and interpretations concerning this dream report, as well as suggestions of other dream-containing songs that might be used in future articles (please send them to <a href="../@chrisryan">Chris Ryan</a>).</p>

<p>I have two sons. Hill is 6 months and Blake, 3 years old. They have caused my wife, Dale and I many happy days with much pleasure, as well as many sleepless nights and much anxiety. I know that I spend far more time with my sons than my father spent with me, through no fault of his own. Men of his generation (he's 65) left much of the early care of the children to their wives. This is less common in my generation. I've had to train myself how to be with my boys; it's something I taught myself. I've had to reach deep inside to extract a workable model, sometimes skipping a generation to remember my grandfathers. </p>

<p>Recently when I was fishing with Blake from our tiny boat one laid back afternoon, I remembered a dream I had before he was born, in fact, when I was deciding whether to become a father at all in my early 30's. The dream, though simple in itself, revealed complex generational layers of father-son interaction and helped give me the boost I needed to brave the waters of fatherhood. I dreamt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A sad boy's voice calls out "My father never took me fishing".</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke with a deep sense of grief that stayed with me for days. I discussed my dream and feelings with Dale, my most trusted dream analyst. I told it to my sister, Anne, who is 4 years younger than I. I even shared it with my mother, perhaps not judiciously, since she still harbors resentment toward her ex-husband, who divorced her in 1969.</p>

<p>In order to get a handle on what the dream meant to me, I returned to my childhood and remembered my love of fishing. Give me a hook, some old string, any slab of bait and some water to throw it into and I was a happy kid. I loved fishing and still do, with approximately the same skill as that 9 year old and his funky equipment. The truth is, that my father rarely did take me fishing. My friends' dads took me, my two grandfathers and an uncle someimes took me, but rarely my dad. Sons don't want substitutes, they want their fathers.</p>

<p>The emphasis on the word "never" in my dream struck me. It wasn't literally or completely true, since Bob had on occasions taken me fishing. Perhaps the dream image was metaphorical? I thought back to my many dreams of fishing. A common symbol in my dreams is of fish... catching or losing them: big ones, sick ones; fish from deep or shallow waters, pond or rushing river. I believe fish refer to my inner creative life, just as the fish historically refers to the Christ as the source of all life. Fishing represents for me pleasure, relaxation, creativity, sustenance. In short, both physical and spiritual sustenance.</p>

<p>So what was it that my father never did with me? He never taught me how to use my spiritual life to sustain myself in the world. He couldn't teach me what he didn't know... he was trained to take care of others, to be a provider for his family... not to nurture his inner life. That's "selfish"! He was a decent father. He provided for his family the best way he knew how. I'm not angry with him for not giving me what I needed... he was preoccupied completely with his own marital, work and personal problems to such an extent that he couldn't teach his children the most important human function: how to nurture oneself ("self-fish"?). Without this ability, which I believe Dad lacked through no fault of his own, one cannot satisfactorily engage in relationships. Life to me is about relationships. The inability to relate to children is passed on from father to father until someone in a crisis recreates it through inspiration. </p>

<p>I was finally able to mourn and understand what was lacking in my childhood. Instead of being preoccupied with my loss, I was able to have the courage to become a father, to "take my sons fishing" in spite of my fears. I've still never told the dream to my father, though I've told him many other things in our working through to a communicative caring relationship. Perhaps he'll read this. I know his father rarely took him fishing. I sympathize with him. </p>

<p>It obviously takes time to learn how to be an effective self-nurturer and thereby a nurturer of ones' children. Many in my father's generation automatically assumed the responsibility of parenthood to be a by-product of marriage. I waited 10 years for fatherhood not in order to indulge myself in a selfish "me generation", but so that I might know myself a little better than my father knew himself, so that my children could benefit from my "self-fishing".</p>

  <p><em>"The true history of the spirit is not preserved in learned volumes but in the living psychic organism of every individual." -C.G. Jung C.W. 11,56</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>I. Psyche Speaks</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>It is quite remarkable, because it is so rare, to see in public such a collection of unattributed, uncommented, unexplained, unanalyzed, uninterpreted dreams as those <a href="../bcpqoa3iell">on exhibit in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em></a> this past year. As your editor said in introducing this unusual gathering, she wanted "psyche to speak for itself" in response to the journal's research calling for "dreams which belong to the larger community." This simple appeal reaped a rich and varied bounty. </p>

<p>Yes, psyche has spoken! But to whom? To what end? Do not expect me to answer these questions by interpreting or analyzing the dreams in this exhibition. That would violate the spirit with which they were gathered. Instead, imagine we had been viewing these dreams in silence and began speaking with one another. A conversation. For some reason, in the face of these dreams, I want to speak in whispers, though these dreams stir strong passions in me. Of course, my murmurings on these pages are rather one sided. So I'll just set off and see what comes.</p>

<h2>II. Dreams as Gift &amp; Voice of Source</h2>

<p>What has been gathered together in this harvest called "Dreaming Humanity's Path," this dream gallery of psyche's speech? First, we find dreams experienced as gifts given to an audience of one (the dreamer) arriving unbidden, seemingly from some dimension beyond the personal and gifted again to a larger audience .... we, the community of the journal's readers. As the word itself reveals (com-, "together"; munnus, "gift"), it is precisely this circulation of gifts, this "gifting together" that identifies the essential nature of any genuine community. In some quiet time you might want to ponder how to keep such gifts circulating. </p>

<p>Second, we find dreams experienced as big dreams, dreams of strikingly numinous intensity, the dreamer impelled to share the dream with another, as if following some ancient imperative... perhaps even one of evolutionary significance.</p>

<h2>"This dream is not yours alone; it belongs to others as well. Tell it!"</h2>

<p>Surely one intention of such dreams and their telling is to stir us to wakefulness, to choicefull participation in the making of our future. </p>

<p>Third, the dreamer of the big dream experiences a strangely palpable contact with "the source" of that dream, and in gifting the dream to others, this sense of contact and thus potential community with "the source" is enlarged. All readers and hearers of the big dream may become directly or subliminally more related to "the source" of such dreams. I'll leave it to the reader to imagine the social and political consequences of this. </p>

<p>Fourth, this "source" is not experienced as personal or individual. One feels a bit shy even at saying "my" dream. Rather, there is a sense of something "sent", as if by courier, a meaning-filled message from underneath or beyond the personal. There is as well a definite feeling that it is this "rhizomic" dimension in which we all may be connected in some mysterious and unfathomable way. We can't say much about this "source" with any assurance. And while there are many names for this source, I will refer to it here simply as the mythic realm. I think the reason why such dreams are sensed by the dreamer as having immediate significance, not only to the dreamer but to everyone, is because such dreams are intimations of myths in formation, myths that will underlie the fabric of all that we are and all that we do, and all that we will become. Such dreams are not just recyclings of old myths or retellings in new clothes, but <em>new</em> myths that will be the structure and dynamics of our future.</p>

<p>The dreams collected here might be titled more accurately, "Dreaming Humanity's Path<em>s</em>", for it is surely more meaningful to think not of one fixed future, but of many possible futures. What our conscious role in such futures might be, what determinant role our choices might have, could be informed by big dreams in a way that we have scarcely allowed ourselves to imagine.</p>

<h2>III. Dreams &amp; Community</h2>

<p>The reason why interpretation fails big dreams is that interpretation tends toward understanding even big dreams only in terms of what already is known, while the big dream is speaking, as Jung said, in terms that are not yet fully known. The big dream cannot be fully netted by interpretive approaches because it speaks in a language (or languages) not yet fully known. In this sense, we must always be students of the big dream, trying always to learn the language of the mythic realm, to learn psyche's speech. </p>

<p>In earlier times, when communities were truly local, such dreams were conveyed to "the elders" and if judged to be big dreams, they were then conveyed to all members of the community. This way with the dream played a crucial role in engendering the fabric of community life because such dreams became the source of and foundation for the myths of the people. In the present time, this natural sense of sharing the big dream with others is so rare we have very nearly lost all sense of the crucial importance of this. We no longer even have rituals for doing so. We need to relearn this art. </p>

<p>In the contemporary world, how do such dreams find their way into community? What and when does the larger community ever hear of such dreams? Where in the world do we hear these messages from the mythic realm in a collective sense? I hear nothing of this on the TV talk shows. I see nothing in the newspapers. I do not hear our "elders" or world leaders telling us of big dreams. </p>

<p>This is where <em>Dream Network</em> is doing important work and where the dream sharing groups and communities have their ultimate significance. We have no larger forums for hearing our big dreams. In <em>Psyche Speaks</em>, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...to have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the time to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How I would love to see a journal, a TV program, a radio show, even a web site in which only the dream text itself is presented, a cultural repository for big dreams. Seeing these dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em> is like a seedling for such possibilities. We need places to hear big dreams. As a community we can contribute to this need by continuing to send in our big dreams to Dream Network. Something will come of this! </p>

<h2>IV. Alterity, Fate &amp; Dream's Desire</h2>

<p>We can't say much about "the source" except to emphasize its strong sense of alterity, its otherness. It is this alterity that the big dream brings to our awareness and, I believe, stirs a yearning, a deep desire, an eros. Part of this is reflected as noted above in the impulse to share the dream with others. But telling others, as deeply satisfying as this is, is not sufficient. Something else is at work on us in relation to the big dream. A hint as to what this might be was offered to me in a dream several years ago. In it, I found written on a slip of paper, poem like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>A dream wants a dream</em></h2>
  
  <h2><em>A poem wants a poem</em></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as I enjoy interpreting dreams, teaching others to learn and exercise the craft of interpretation, and even as an analyst getting paid for it, I know that interpretation is not the desire of the dream. The dream wants a dream! So, now I imagine that the purpose of the "small" dream is to make us conscious and more complete (that is through resolving complexes, integrating the shadow, developing our human relatedness), essential, crucial and necessary tasks. </p>

<p>And the purpose of the big dream? Its purpose is twofold: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>To engender community through the medium of telling the dream, that is, dream calling to dream, the dream of one desiring the dream of the other, and </p></li>
<li><p>To create a sense of task, the sense of what the dreamer is <em>for</em> in this life, and from that, for the dreamer to bring the manifestation of that to some realization in actual life and therefore into the reality that is the world. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps this sense of human community may become realized in the Aquarian age, the age of the water bearer. This is an image of each one of us in some unique contact with "the source" and from that contact bringing something back to the larger community. Part of that "bringing back" is the dream itself and part of our contribution to the weaving of the threads of community is to tell our big dreams to one another. In this way, the "otherness" in the big dream is able to call forth the "otherness" in others through engendering dreams in others. </p>

<p>The dream wants a dream. But our task is not complete by telling only. The big dream always imposes some task on the dreamer. That task has a great deal to do with whatever we mean by "fate." It is the work of the dreamer to bring into presently lived life some manifestation of the big dream. That manifestation, too, will likely be shared and will constitute, through its giftlike circulation, a vitalizing presence in the world. </p>

<h2>V. Dream-Formed Communities</h2>

<p>Klee said he didn't want to give talks about art because people would listen with their ears and not their hands. And if one were to listen with one's hands? Of course! Listening hands would be painting hands! A painting wants a painting! That's why Baudelaire said the only proper criticism of a work of art is a work of art. Art wants art! This desire is not ego's desire but the desire of the "other" in us for connection to " the other" in our fellow beings. It is out of this connection (deep psyche to deep psyche) that there could arise a basis for community that would be generative and give birth and manifestation to the deepest intentionality of the psyche. This is what I see as the ultimate significance of sharing big dreams: <em>a dream-formed community</em>. This is not a picture of only single, isolated individuals individuating apart from the world. </p>

<p>The purpose of individuation cannot be isolation. Rather, the purpose of individuation must be for an individual to develop sufficiently to hear the "deep song" of the psyche, to bring into the world what is experienced there, and to pour this into the living history of humanity. This in turn will call to the deep psyche in others and stimulate this self-same process. It is the iteration of this process across individuals that is the promise of the postmodern spirit. The intent is not narrow, narcissistic individualism, but to so engage individual development so that the common pool becomes a rich resource for the nourishment and growth of each and everyone. As Jung saw, <em>"individuation gathers the world to itself."</em> </p>

<h2>VI. Forming the Vessel</h2>

<p>A newspaper published recently a story of two women artists who decided to correspond only in painting. So, one woman sent a painting to the other. After living and being with that painting for a time, that woman painted her response and sent it off. Back and forth, paintings only. Twenty of these paintings are now on exhibit in a gallery. Very instructive! For anyone drawn to dream sharing, corresponding in dreams (just the dreams, not the interpretation!) may open up many new and unexplored possibilities. As a community we might try just this and see what happens. Or, in your dream sharing groups try this. Sit for a time in silence and bring to mind dreams or visions that had a powerful impact on you. When you feel ready, simply speak out an image from such a dream. Others will do the same. Round and round, speaking out only images from dreams, no comment, no interpretation, no explanation. Telling images without the apparatus of explanation engenders a powerful field effect in the group, a palpable dimensionality that begins to generate an enormous eros. One gets the impression of a vessel of information, a place of potential incarnation of something beyond the personal aspects of the dreamers in the circle. The potential of this is unexplored. And waiting. </p>

<p>What is certain, however, is that working on the group's aspirations, difficulties, troubles, issues, or other concerns following such an experience, is remarkable. We don't generally seem to have much faith in the idea that the dream (like a story, like art of any sort) can engender its effects all by itself. We seem addicted to the idea that for the dream to have its effect it must be interpreted and explained. </p>

<p>This would be like insisting that a poem always be published with its explanation, a painting always viewed along side its critique. That is nonsense. The whole point of the poem, art, and yes, the dream too, is to "get through," to achieve some conception in the psyche of its audience. It is what happens next that is crucial, not what we say about it, but what it engenders in us as response from our own depth. A dream wants a dream. A poem wants a poem. This nexus of relationship: dream to dream, poem to poem, painting to painting, is largely unexplored territory. What did you dream in response to those "naked" dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em>?</p>

<p>It's something like the above that leads me to imagine a future in which the dream once again takes on a value and role even in the centers of power. Is such a thing possible? As I watch the leaders of the world gathered together in a truly extraordinary way at Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, how I would love for them to sit circled with one another and with nothing else as agenda, simply tell the images from their dreams, round and round, until they feel that dimensionality of alterity. Such experience could become a basis for experiencing what "the source" has to say about what needs to be manifested in the future. In this, they and others would discover that the basis of their rejection of "the other" in human form, is a result of not genuinely experiencing "the other" in mythic form. All true experience of the mythic dimension generates an eros of inclusiveness. The failure of this generates the power of exclusiveness and becomes the secret source of the ubiquity and power of prejudice.</p>

<h2>VII. Dream as Subversive</h2>

<p>In these times there is, on occasion, a yearning for something that truly punctures our consciousness, something that breaks through the increasingly addictive fog of image-driven consumerist miasma. Occasionally, world events (atrocities, assassinations, natural calamities), often times local events (killings close to home, the rage at horrific secrets revealed), sometimes personal experiences (a sudden loss, a reversal, a tragedy) break through this fog. Still, so much of this is now mediated by media, rather than direct experience, that its shock value, its potential of penetration, is lessening remarkably in our lifetime. It's as if we could arrive very shortly, perhaps more shortly than we care to imagine, at having TV cameras showing us bodies being delivered to the ovens, or the killing fields, while we sit silently couched to inaction, hungering for the next scene. When reality becomes entertainment what then? </p>

<p>Today, we are double yoked to insatiable work and endless entertainment. Underlying all of this is the commodification of desire. This is what is whipping us along. I continue to believe that the last holdout to this process, that which will retain the power to puncture our increasing insensibility, will be the dream. I continue to believe that the dream will be the last resistance to the devouring dynamics of money. And because of this, we may be edging close to a time when it will be a crime to dream and there will be every effort made to control this uncontrollable access to a source beyond the world of power. The dream is always subversive of the status quo, particularly the big dream. The dream will always be outlaw, always alien. At some point the dream will threaten the established order, as that order becomes ever more rigid and confined. As more and more of the population becomes medicated as a means of coping with the increasing density of events and their demands on our time and attention, the dream will begin to fade away as is the fate of dreams under most medications.</p>

<p>Power will attempt to appropriate the dream. Already this appropriation is happening in language where "dream" is now the buzzword in advertisement. Listen to this add for Compuserve: "What do you dream of doing? Does it involve work? Or travel? Or your children? Is your dream to create something? Or go somewhere? Or meet someone? Is it a big overwhelming dream? Or just a tiny dream the size of your baby? Is understanding a part of your dream? Is joy? Is fun? No matter what you dream of, go online with Compuserve. Maybe if you had ten free hours on our online service, you could get that fat, lazy dream off the ground." Watch for how dream increasingly is used in relation to money, possession, and power. </p>

<h2>VIII. Embracing the Future</h2>

<p>Dreams are not "about" the past at all; instead they are the psyche's way of <em>preparing</em> the future. Not preparing for the future, but preparing the future. So a dream does not "predict" the future so much as it is a thread from which the future is woven. It is not that there is a future fixed and immutable that incarnates itself inevitably, nor some pre-design that is rolling out like clockworks; rather, the future is prepared as a cooking, a weaving, and these things we call dreams are as if tasting a dish in preparation, a weaving in the making. Are these the futures we want? Are we free to choose? What part can we play consciously?</p>

<p>What is privileged, then, in my view, is the dream. We mortgage our future when we mobilize our energies only to re-birthing the past. We are coming to a time of the bankruptcy of these methodologies -the old psychologies of the dream. The past is known (or we like to think so) and is therefore secure and provides us with limits within which to operate. The future is insecure (and cannot be predicted) and so we try to reduce it inevitably to the knownness of the past. We see the future only as an extension of the past and therefore we are secure in the legitimacy of privileging the past as the source of our facing the future. </p>

<p>But what if this is not so? Let us imagine that different futures are possible from the same past and that it takes only a minor variation to lead to a profound bifurcation with the past.... and that the source of that "minor variation" is pictured to us in those experiences we call dreams, particularly big dreams. So it would be what we "construct" with the guidance of the big dream, how we enact the big dream that will yield a rich new way of leading us into the future. </p>

<p>That is why I so value what we have begun here in <em>Dream Network</em>. The raw dream, dream brut, is the most powerful antidote I can imagine to the not so subtle and escalating fascism throughout the world, that seeks increasingly to control our thought and soul. We must take solace and inspiration from the simple fact that no one will pay money for a dream. Dreams are freely given to us and must be freely given in return. </p>

<p>The community that learns to operate on the basis of the circulating gift of dreams will be the community immune to the commodification of desire that so threatens the true potential of the human spirit. </p>

<p>I'd like to know what these dreams and thoughts have stirred in you, so by all means, whether in shouts or whispers, let me know.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Illustration by <a href="http://www.dalegottlieb.com/">Dale Gottlieb</a></i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>During the summer of '83 I was working in a dirty, crowded pottery studio in downtown Manhattan, trying to get my small business organized. My wife Dale and I had moved to Brooklyn the year before in order to help her rapidly growing illustration career. I missed the home we had built and still owned in New Hampshire where I was more used to the "laid back" attitude of country life. I also missed our 5 year old meditation group where we had frequently shared dreams. In short, I felt disconnected and miserable. </p>

<p>One day, while glazing some teapots and listening to the radio, I heard about the "Self Help Clearinghouse," a service that people could call for information about meditation groups, self-help groups, and other activities. I called that day and asked if there were any dream groups in Manhattan. But I got the number of the <em>Brooklyn Dream Community</em> instead. I met Tom Cowan the director, and a week later found myself in a group of 15 strangers at his apartment in Brooklyn, where I volunteered to share a recent dream. Bill Stimson was leading the group that night, using Montague Ullman's method of group adoption of the dream in a protective environment. Here is the dream I shared: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I am teaching a baby - a gorgeous infant - how to swim underwater. I begin by teaching him how to hold his breath, then we work our way to progressively more difficult things. He is fat and happy, learns fast, and loves the water. I am astonished at how well he swims underwater. There are other people watching us from the beach - I sense there may be some disapproval of my actions but I ignore their fears. I don't think the baby is my child but am unsure."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the group, led by Bill, adopted and worked with my dream, I felt a powerful insight that I was about to embark on a new project in my life, one that would involve a spontaneous exploration of my unconscious that would be witnessed and shared by others. </p>

<p>I felt strangely moved and sensitized, and wrote Bill a <a href="../bcpov6krusep/separation-is-the-problem">letter</a> the next day, which he published in his two year old project, The <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>. Bill began the <em>DNB</em> about the same time that he started The Manhattan Dream Community the winter of '81. He was looking for a way to connect people to one another through the sharing of dreams in groups and everyday experience. His motivations were personal. He was looking for a way to connect with himself, and also for a way to help others connect with each other. For two years, through exhausting bouts of poverty, late night organizing and letter writing, he established a network of individuals interested in dreams throughout the US, Canada, Europe and even the Soviet Union. Soviet parapsychologists met clandestinely and shared their insights through DNB, as did Roman Catholic nuns, psychoanalysts, "shamanistic" dreamers, lucid dreamers, and other varied people. He always printed their names and addresses and hoped that interested people would contact one another, especially to form dream groups. Often they did, and articles, letters, and experiments in group dreaming came into being. </p>

<p>I met with the <em>Brooklyn Dream Community</em> for several months and also kept in touch with Bill and his work. One day he suggested I attend a Dream Leadership Training Workshop with him at Monte Ullman's home north of New York. I called Monte only to find that the workshop was filled. "Does anyone ever drop out?," I asked him. "Extremely rarely," was the reply. "Well if anyone does, please put me at the top of your list!" </p>

<p>That night I had the following dream (excerpted from my journal): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dale and I are driving Bill Stimson to Monte's workshop... Monte and his wife are very gracious. We all sit down. I'm aware that Dale and I will only be staying a couple of minutes. I say to the group, 'It's nice to have a home so full of light'... there suddenly seems to be room for Dale and I to attend, because someone cancelled. We decide to stay."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very next morning, Monte called to say that a woman had dropped out and there would be room for me if I wanted to attend. At this point, I felt I had no choice! I drove Bill up and back each day of the workshop, talking over dreams, plans, and goals for the future. At one point Bill asked, "Why don't you take over the <em>Bulletin</em>?" Touched by his offer, but not feeling ready for such a venture, I was hesitant. I really felt I didn't want it, but I began to have powerful dreams encouraging me to accept it. Here is an excerpt from one of several such dreams:</p>

  <p><em>" ...I sense Yoda's presence. The beauty of being joined through his eyes to an ancient, permanently connected Unconscious Mind that I usually deny. I think of Bill Stimson and how we are so alike in strange but similar ways, that the DNB is his "baby" - that to give it up would be hard for him... I feel a vision of the sharing of dreams realigning our perceptions to take in another, "unseparate" sense of other people, especially the ones we care about. I feel love reawakened. I feel joined to others in a sweet, "sexy", primal intelligence that does not "think" about love but "feels" about love, and reveals loving faces in my mind so gently that I can hardly bear it. I feel at one with these people and my self."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke crying, overwhelmed by the connective power in dream work, and in sharing dreams, so strongly that I felt I had no choice but to accept editorship. </p>

<p>So, for over a year and a half I have buried myself in writing letters, developing a new graphic look for the <em>DNB</em> with computerized typesetting and Dale's beautiful drawings, have enlarged it to 20 pages and 6 issues a year... other people have generously volunteered to help with editing, paste-up, computerizing the subscriptions and a dozen day to day details. As a result, the <em>DNB</em> has more subscribers and more exchanges of dreamwork ideas and experiences. And I still have dreams about the importance of this network.</p>

<p>However, after 8 issues I've become overwhelmed by the worry and work, and am passing on the editorial torch to Bob Van de Castle and Henry Reed, who in the past have offered to help out. The editorial staff and advisory board (as well as the general tone and format) will remain basically the same. I hope Henry and Bob will put their own fire into it... financial needs especially have pulled me in another direction and I have to devote time and energy to my new woodworking job in Claremont, New Hampshire.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krudnb-1.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Illustration"/></p>

<p>I laid awake several nights over this decision and finally received some clarity from some dreams. In one, I was a construction worker at the woodshop where I now work, with a small group of other men. My right arm was covered with silver bracelets which the other men regarded as odd. But I felt a deep sense of belonging and peace. When I awoke I also knew the silver meant prosperity. </p>

<p>Although the DNB has always (usually just barely) paid for itself, there has never been money left over to pay editors and so forth. But a lot of attention and time are required to keep the thing rolling. Perhaps a shared editorship will make it less of a time-consumer. Many of you are aware of Henry's involvement with <em>The Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> and Bob's long involvement with dream study through The University of Virginia at Charlottesville. Both men have been active in dreamwork longer than I have and are also more experienced. Their success will be your success; DNB is ripe for another growth burst. </p>

<p>I never intended to take the Network on permanently, but it truly has been "my baby" for a while, and not easy to give up. I hope to write occasionally on these pages and help out where I can. <em>You</em> can help with letters, articles, resubscriptions and any feedback.</p>

<p>One of my abiding interests in dreams is their relationship to the "Inner Voice" or "that of God in every man" (as the Quakers phrase it). This is because I came into dreamwork from meditation and prayer as well as being a 5 year student of an attitudinal healing workbook called <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. Edgar Cayce remains still today one of the clearest voices for the connection between dreams and God. My prayers led me into dream study because for me it was the clearest way to understand my feelings. It is possible to meditate very hard for years and still not know how one feels. Specifically, dreams made me aware of feelings toward members of my family. Subsequent healings have occurred between me and my father, mother, brother and sister... all attributable indirectly to feelings I came upon through dreams. All the members of my family send me dreams or discuss them over the phone and when we see one another. The family can be the best dream group! </p>

<p>When I was cutting wood with my older brother Pete last winter at his home in northern Maine, we got up around 5 a.m. It was dark and we sat groggily around the stove discussing our dreams. He later said it was one of the best visits he ever had with me. He knew nothing of "technique" but as a voracious reader his whole life his awareness of metaphor was sharp. I can hardly wait to discuss a dream my sister Anne sent me. It turns out that we have a mutually occurring scary dream that I'm certain has a common history that we can explore together. I know it will bring us closer. </p>

<p>The most important attitude I have learned while nursing the DNB is that dreams can be trusted to bear the truth. They will not maliciously fabricate metaphors that are meaningless or random. There is a message and the message has meaning. Generally my eyes are closed to myself and my life is like an iceberg. I am dumbly convinced that the 10% that I can see above the surface is all there is. Until I run aground on the other 90% under water!</p>

<p>There can be a danger to excessive dreamwork if it is an attempt to escape from waking life. If this happens, the dream images will point one back to life responsibilities and grounding activities. At least this was true with me. The more common problem is the <em>lack</em> of attention to inner life. </p>

<p>The personal healings within my family through dreamwork were accompanied by a gradual dissolving of distressing feelings of separation from other people and society in general. Feeling "separate" is one of the severest of social diseases of our time, one that can be helped through group study of the workings of the personal unconscious. Once last year when I was feeling disconnected from others I had a dream filled with images of family and friends, alive and deceased, that was so vivid I awoke literally shaking with joy. The only other place I have experienced such rapture was when I have surrendered my will up in prayer and felt wordless connection to all life... healed, safe, forgiven and whole. </p>

<p>Another element in dreamwork is the accompanying force for change. When I resist the nightly messages it is because I'm <em>afraid</em> to change, I want to hang on to my little neurotic securities. My ego does not go happily into sleep. I drag it there. In the hypnogogic stage before early sleep, conscious thought is released as another level of the mind steps forth. In my way of looking at things, that's where God speaks to me. My problem is that every night my timid definition of God is shattered once again. "How could a loving God give me such awful images?" "Why can't God be straightforward instead of metaphorical and speak verbally instead of in images?" I don't know. I only know that... [TO BE CONTINUED... MISSING PAGE NEEDS RESCANNING!] </p>

<p>The crucial aspect of dreamwork to me is its personal, humane approach. Our dreams help us to understand ourselves and relate to others, they enrich our lives from the inside out. There's a lot of extraneous psychobabble that can be discarded. No Ph.D. is required to understand that dream messages usually explain our feelings about our day to day lives. These can be felt and shared. </p>

<p>What excites me about my dream group is the personal sharing that results from the careful exchange of dreams. My own help me reach into myself and out to others. They encourage me to feel included in the Universal Mind. My intellect tends to say, "This part of me, that part of me," but in my dreams, all "parts" are aspects of a psychic family. In the same way, individuals are "parts," but only intellectually. Actually we are on the same evolutionary path toward the recollection of our natural wholeness. </p>

<p>Dreams are things we share in common - they are "safe" because the message is veiled in symbology. Sharing a dream message about feeling scared is easier than saying "I feel scared" to a group in a room. Dreams also seem to "happen" to us, even though we usually create them.</p>

<p>I have a vision of a network of dream hotlines, where listeners could receive calls from people who wanted to understand their dream message. It could be a one to one interview method, anonymous unless the caller wanted to join the larger network. Then they would pay dues and be entitled to newsletters and meetings. They could become listeners themselves. </p>

<p>The most serious problem facing people is the separation we feel from our selves and one another. This manifests in the social attitude of "every man for himself" and damaging competitiveness. We all long for community and family. If we look deeply into our dreams, this common thread becomes evident. It cuts through all the red tape in relationships.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>According to a front page article in the July 1988 <em>New York Times</em>, an estimated 12 to 15 million North Americans are members of self-help organizations. This number has doubled in the last 10 years and includes roughly 500,000 separate organizations. The article, by Patricia Leigh Brown, goes on to define a self-help group as: "one in which people who face a common concern or condition come together voluntarily for emotional support and practical assistance. They generally meet without professional supervision, though they may draw upon professional expertise". Brown quotes numerous sources describing the "worldwide phenomenon" of these groups, which are partly inspired by the Alcoholics Anonymous movement begun in the 1930s. </p>

<p>Dream groups are a growing part of this awakening giant of mutual aid. People who believe dreams are meaningful need a safe place to share and understand their dreams. There are a large number of people who believe that dreams have only neurological or biological meaning, as well as an even larger number who aren't sure or don't care. I personally am convinced that all my dreams have meaning and I want to understand what that meaning is. What concerns me is how to get together with people who feel similarly, because my dreams are complex, need a social context to reveal themselves, and I frequently can't see beyond my own nose, while someone else can. </p>

<p>The following are ten of many good reasons why I encourage people to form or join dream groups, based on my own belief &amp; experience:  </p>

<h3>Kindred Spirits:</h3>

<p>I need to be in a group that values dreams and believes as I do, that dreams are meaningful and have practical healing value on many levels.  </p>

<h3>Inexpensive:</h3>

<p>These groups are either free or relatively inexpensive, especially compared to therapy.  </p>

<h3>Not therapy:</h3>

<p>With the emphasis on helping the dreamer with his or her dream, there is no focus on interpersonal relationships in the group, as in group therapy.  </p>

<h3>No ideological pressures:</h3>

<p>In therapy, the training or bias of the therapist (often unspoken) will flavor the attitude toward dream work.  </p>

<h3>More attention to the dream:</h3>

<p>In therapy, there is a 50 minute hour, much of which is allotted to discussing the emotional life of the client; time is too precious to 'waste' all of it over discussion of dream material. </p>

<h3>No hierarchy:</h3>

<p>The group is egalitarian; the facilitator doesn't have to be a clinically trained therapist who is "doing" therapy and responsible for the emotional needs of any individual or the group. The facilitator also shares dreams.</p>

<h3>Dreamer controlled process:</h3>

<p>The dreamer controls the level of disclosure and is under no pressure to reveal more than s/he is comfortable with in the group. The dreamer is assisted in coming to an interpretation for him or herself.  </p>

<h3>Socializing:</h3>

<p>Dream groups are an exceptional way to meet people and make friends, as opposed to the "problematic" nature of seeking psychotherapy or analysis. (Try inviting your therapist to dinner, and see what happens!)  </p>

<h3>Generalize-ability:</h3>

<p>The skills learned in dream groups may be used and taught to spouses, friends, children. No formal training is necessary to become more fluent in the language of dreams.  </p>

<h3>Pleasurable:</h3>

<p>We spend so much of our time wearing the persona of our different roles in our relationships at work, home, and socializing, that it's pleasurable to "strip down" and share more of our deeper selves in a safe environment with others. There's something intangible that happens in that environment; sharing &amp; helping are brave, human acts that cause us to feel more connected to others and feel better inside. </p>

<p>There are a host of other therapy related issues that are avoided in the setting of the non-therapist facilitated dream group, but in my mind there is one that stands out: self-empowerment. You can easily start your own group if there are none available locally or you don't like the "feel" of what's available in your area. Especially beware of therapist-led groups in which the leader insists one "has to be a therapist to do this": That is a tip-off that it's going to be dreamwork and therapy. There are many therapists who have successfully removed their therapists' hat and led such groups; but in general, experts don't like to be co-opted. Professional therapists serve functions that cannot be fulfilled by dream groups and vice-versa. I'm in therapy and find it very rewarding, but in my dream group, I feel I get the best help with my dreams.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, would you describe for me what it is that you do with dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I do dreamwork with individuals, teach and give presentations at bookstores, community college, conferences and at the Dream House in San Francisco, and write articles and columns for dream-related publications. I have been involved in several networking activities such as the "Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers Group" (which Fred Olsen and I co-founded); the "Seth Dream Network" (for which I served as coordinator); the "Association for the Study of Dreams (as membership chairperson); and as a co-chairperson for the "Dream Educators' Network". Also, for the past three years, I have facilitated an international lucid group dreaming experiment called "The Lucidity Project". </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6magai2-0.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Linda Magallon"/></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Linda Magallón</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Do you find time to keep your dream journals and to do your own dreamwork? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, yes, definitely! A dreamworker is first of all a dreamer. I must admit a bias. I find it very difficult to understand dreamworkers who do not keep journals or pay attention to their own dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What methods of dreamwork do you use? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Being an eclectic, I like to experiment with many different methods: first with myself, then with my family and finally with the public. My three favorites are Fred Olsen's Waking Dream Re-Entry and Relmaging method which is a Jungian active imagination technique; Gayle Delaney's Dream Definition Analysis method which clarifies personal symbols; and Fritz Perls' Gestalt method which incorporates dialoguing with dream symbols and characters. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Have you always recalled your dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I can remember that as a child I had nightmares which often ended with Mafioso types clutching at my ankles as I tried to fly away. However, my first love was not dreams but rather imagination because I could control the scenario. This lasted until March 8, 1982, when I had my first lucid dream. That life-changing dream lead me into dreamwork. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> It sounds as though you moved very quickly from a strong interest in dreams to active involvement with the dreamworker community. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> From the onset I was really very interested in the way in which dreams fit into the context of society. So I very purposely sought out other dreamers and dreamworkers. For example, after I read the book, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, I wrote the author, Jean Campbell. When she wrote back, we began correspondence that culminated in friendship. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> You mentioned that as a child you preferred fantasizing over dreaming because of the element of control. And now you are an avid and frequent lucid dreamer who enjoys varying degrees of control within the dream state. How would you respond to someone who is concerned about the effects or applications of control within a dream? </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6magai2-1.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Linda Magallon"/></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Linda Magallón</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Lucidity brings you to the point of being aware that you are dreaming. That is a point of decision. You could choose to be very manipulative or completely passive. What you choose to do can be quite revealing when you compare it with how you usually act in the waking state. </p>

<p>To me the dream is powerful, wise and self-regulating. I don't have to worry about over-controlling my dream because when I start doing that, my dream characters turn around and give me a bad time. the trick is to befriend the dream, to develop a cooperative relationship. </p>

<p>I have many different types of dreams other than lucid dreams which give me the opportunity to dwell in the dream in a more passive role. All kinds of dreams can bring me knowledge and guidance. </p>

<p>One other thing that I would say is that it is my belief that some people use their dreams primarily as a pressure valve. If I am taking care of business in the waking state, I don't have to rely upon dreams to straighten me out. This frees me up to look at dreams in other ways, to approach them like creative compositions, neat little movies or explorations of consciousness. These other ways are therapeutic and beneficial as well because I awaken from them with my self-esteem lifted and my spirits high.</p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, in addition to regarding you as a resource on dream lucidity, I also regard you as a resource on dream telepathy. Would you tell me how you know when a dream is telepathic and whether or not you do dreamwork with a telepathic dream? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I do a fair amount of checking with other people for correlations and that is the usual way that I discover that a particular dream is telepathic. Of course, it's easier if I have incubated a telepathic dream. Those times when a symbol just seems to drop in from out of nowhere are the times when I suspect that I am borrowing symbolic shorthand from someone else, especially if I identify that person in my dream.</p>

<p>A telepathic dream, like any other, can be viewed as meaningful metaphor for the dreamer. The dreamer is ultimately responsible for his or her own dream. If the dream is telepathic, the dreamer can ask "Why did I attract that information? Why am I picking that up?" </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Before you became immersed in the dream profession, did you hold positions in other fields? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, yes. I hold a Masters in Business Administration and have taught in public schools from the elementary to the college level. I've worked in business, social service agencies, government and in career counseling. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> How does this background affect you now as a dreamworker?</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> The wide variety of careers that I have had enables me to deal with the whole spectrum of the dream community, from the avid dreamers to the academicians and clinicians. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> One of my concerns is how the dream community can minimize factionalism between these two groups. What would you recommend? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> In my view, dreamwork is as multi-layered as the dreams themselves. The best benefit for the dream community is to acknowledge and encourage the entire range of dreamwork from clinical research to personal application. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> That reminds me of your idea of the dreamwork community as having "a lot of stars". </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Exactly. Since most dreamworkers have survived in a vacuum, they have had to be very self sufficient. They are strongly individual. Of course, all of this diversity means that there is more flavoring to the pot. The trick is to pull together enough to make what could be called a movement out of it. My hunch is that if the dream movement can piggy-back on the self-help movement, it will take off. </p>

<p>One of the issues facing dreamworkers today is how to be considered legitimate. Those of us who do not have degrees after our names, want validity without necessarily coming under rigid structure and rules. Those of us who do have degrees, want to be considered legitimate by the scientific and psychological communities and by the sources for research funding. I think that one of the solutions to this quest for legitimacy is simply for dream information and dreamwork to be made widely available to the public. <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em> can help. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, what are the goals for <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em> under your editorship? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> First off, I would like to say that I intend to keep the basic format the same. I give a lot of credit to the former editors, the people who work behind the scenes (like co-editor Bob Trowbridge) and to the subscribers for putting together an excellent periodical that serves as a forum for the entire dreamwork community. </p>

<p>My goals for the Bulletin are to build up the readership base; to encourage the academicians to submit hardcore informative articles in readable English; and to add more artwork, interviews and humor to the menu. I would also like to see some pro/con articles and more letters to the editor. Contributions are welcome. Everyone is invited to dream up new ideas for <em>DNB</em>.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>De Chirico's paintings come from dimensions of awareness that our kinds of understanding are only imperfect derivatives of. Yet the paintings speak to us, loudly, deeply. They mysteriously transport us to nuances of comprehension not readily grasped or expressed in the ways we have been schooled to be limited to. In this sense they are not unlike our own dreams. could this be because they are our own dreams? I think so. The visions that de Chirico was able to express with such genius on canvas are not unique to him. It is our own deepest stirrings that he has brought before us. His paintings are mirrors of our own minds and souls, How much we can see in them is contingent upon how well we can know what is happening in ourselves. So they may convey quite different messages to different individuals, depending on how far along on the path to self-realization each is. Which message is real? Of course it's the one you feel the strongest that's most real for you. </p>

<p>In our commercial culture art is mistakenly confused with the objects produced by artists. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Art is a mode of perception. The objects or paintings themselves are only ancillary. Yet they are essential to the process just as it is essential for me to put my impressions of these paintings into writing. Anything I can say about de Chirico's paintings is only what some part of me already knows but putting it into words liberates me by bringing this awareness to areas of my mind that aren't privy to this kind of knowing and thus causing them to release their restrictive hold on my natural unfolding. sounds like working with dreams? It is. </p>

<p>Let me emphasize that I know nothing of de Chirico, nothing of painting, and certainly nothing of art criticism. It's the ways we have been taught to approach the art of the masters that kill the process in us all. I am fortunately unburdened by these. The three paintings I have chosen to write about are done scant justice by the photographs reproduced here. De Chirico's paintings don't work in black and white. To miss the color is to miss the meaning. But color paintings are prohibitively expensive to reproduce accurately. These black and white pictures of his paintings still convey the sense of something like dimly remembered dreams, but that "something" itself is gone. I urge our readers to attend this spectacular exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. What this man is saying on canvas and what dreamwork is about are the same thing.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-0.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="The Joy of Return"/></p>

<h2>The Joy of Return</h2>

<p>We live in a world of gray facades flying their black sperm flags of a false fertility, but they are no longer anything but facades. we can see through them, especially at the top. The machines have becomes the center of our world. We are alone, colorless, going to the somewhere that is nowhere to go. But there is a light behind the machine, there is something dawning behind the facades. There is a hope behind all of this bleakness. We can see through all this we know there is something brighter; the dawning of a post-industrial mentality. The man's head isn't on straight. He is each of us. De Chirico entitles this painting "The Joy of Return". What is returning is the light in the sky. It's dawn. It heralds the end of the night that our kind of consciousness and civilization has been for the human soul. It announces the dawn of a new age, a new way of being. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-1.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="The Seer"/></p>

<h2>The Seer</h2>

<p>Creativity is the key. The maker is the made. The artist is the work of art, sitting squarely on his pedestal. It is himself that he is working on. Self-tailored, still incompletely formed: a human, yet a dummy. How deformed are we who create, how powerless of limb. Yet how beautiful, erect, noble. How dead our heads are: deaf and dumb and blind to the inner vision that is burning brightly within us like a star. Could it be that we have to let go of all that our senses have been trained to see and hear and taste, and all that our arms and hands have been trained to touch and feel? Certainly these trained systems are like so many trained monkeys seeing only what they have been taught. Relinquishing all that, we feel a different kind of sight emerging within us. we become the seer. The eye we see with is inside of us. It is the third eye, the eye of enlightened vision. This painting shows our predicament as creators. We have distanced ourselves from our blackboard of mental constructs, and even more so from the massive structure of our civilization. We are in a bare room that is no room at all but opens out into the infinite. It's only out of this emptiness that a new world can be born. Only by owning our creativity will the new human emerge within each of us. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-2.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="The Transformed Dream"/></p>

<h2>The Transformed Dream</h2>

<p>An exploration of nuance and mood is what this painter's work is all about, the nuance of subtle metaphysical perception, the stuff of dreams brought to waking perception. The dream we are living is our culture - the heritage of past knowledge, the remains of the great men and thinkers. This dead dream of industrialized architecture that the thinking mind has constructed all around us is transformed with the more delicate substance that comes from within us, not just from night dreams but from altered states of perception that move from them into our waking life - ephemeral things, these modalities, luscious and fresh like a banana, bountiful and ripe like a whole copious stalk of bananas, aromatic and delicious like the prickly pineapple with its teasing promise of sweetness. The past we've constructed all around us is transformed by these newly emergent modalities of perception. </p>

<p>The dreams we have dreamt into reality all around us are dead substance but become transformed when we open up to the continued unfolding of this dream which places its precious bounty on the altar of the reality that we worship and is its only legitimate compliment. Our world - that empty parade of forms like the ruins of some dead civilization becomes transformed. To dream and to become: only this will populate our world with the life that is the most precious and exotic food for our souls. Only this makes everything else beautiful and fitting. Only this brings life into what all around us is dead. </p>

<p>If art such as de Chirico's is invaluable it is only because it brings us closer to what is happening within us all. His genius mirrors our own. We can't all be great painters like him but we are all - yes, every one of us - great dreamers. And each of us, to do justice to this great dream emerging from within us, must struggle to find his own ways to bring it to the light of day as de Chirico did. Only in this way, and in no other, can we save a world that has grown dead and gray.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I dreamt that most of my front teeth had fallen out. I held them in my hand and looked up into the mirror at my toothless mouth. Horrified beyond measure. it suddenly struck me, "Hold on! This might just be a dream."</p>

<p>"If it is a dream," I reasoned with myself, "then I can fly because in dreams I can fly." Whereupon, remembering how I had done it in previous dreams, I looked down at the floor and, sure enough. with some kind of intentional energy I caused myself to lift up off the floor. I flew right out of that nightmare into a wonderful odyssey of different dreams and adventures that seemed to last throughout the night. I awoke in the morning wonderfully refreshed, feeling I had visited another reality. I had had my first major lucid dream. </p>

<p>Ever since l read Patricia Garfield's <em>Creative Dreaming</em> years ago I had been trying unsuccessfully to dream lucidly. It happened a few nights after THE DREAM COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK had a preliminary meeting with Bill Surgio with regard to the lucid dream machine we are going to test out for him. This illustrates an interesting paradox of human nature. The individual functions at his creative best when part of a group. Individual dreamwork, which the best dreamwork must be, progresses most rapidly when one is working on a regular basis with a dream group. For this reason we have taken it upon ourselves to publicize existing dream groups as they come to our attention. If you know of any that are not listed below or if you are forming one yourself please let us know so we may include it in future issues of our newsletter.</p>

  <p><em>I dream that a conventional appearing middle class woman is calmly and confidently shooting two young lovers with a rifle. She shoots the young woman point blank and then turns the rifle on the young man who stands there horrified as he is shot to death. She is standing in the shadow of the roof of one of those concessions that lined the Boardwalk of Coney Island near where I lived as a child. I can’t see into the room, but by its dimensions this might have been an amusement gallery, the kind with the fortuneteller doll in a glass case in the center who will hand you a paper fortune for a penny or a nickel.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Having killed the lovers, she turns her rifle toward me, where I am watching from about a hundred yards away across the Boardwalk. She wants to silence me, to prevent me from writing about the extraordinary intelligence—and the plight—of the Elephant People. In the dream, my essays are being reprinted and becoming influential. I manage to escape her by fleeing to the Boardwalk entrance ramps where I meet Ron Kovic, the Vietnam veteran antiwar activist whose own story is told in “Born on the Fourth of July.” We greet one another, having been in the anti-war movement at the same time.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Suddenly, I am with him in a small room. He is not in his wheelchair but is standing. I am standing with him and we are embracing each other as comrades. He has healed almost all of his wounds in the course of these years. And he is still Ron Kovic standing up for what he believes.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6meleph-1.jpg" width=500 height="auto"/></p>

<p>I write down the dream and then learn that there was a showing of “Born on the Fourth of July” at the Museum of Modern Art on July 5th, 2012. Alexander Reed Kelley wrote about the event in Truthdig, on July 19th <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/speaking-truth-on-the-fifth-of-july/">http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/speaking<em>truth</em>on<em>the</em>fifth_ of<em>july</em>20120819/</a>. There is a scene in “Born on the Fourth of July” where Kovic, played by Tom Cruise, and a small group of veterans enter the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My name is Ron Kovic. I am a Vietnam veteran,” Kovic says as he attempts to stand up from his wheelchair. “I am here to say that this war is wrong, that this society lied to me. It lied to my brothers. It deceived the people of this country, tricked them into going 13,000 miles to fight a war against a poor peasant people…” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the film, speaking to the audience, Kovic said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s a chill in the air. People are intimidated. … Protest is supposed to be part of our constitutional right and our freedom of assembly, the freedom to question authority and the freedom to redress our grievances, which we saw during the Occupy movement… Since 9/11, those who protest are almost made to feel as if they’re the enemy. …They’re afraid of being called traitors and being called un-American,” as Kovic himself has been called continuously, since speaking out against the wars, while sitting in his wheelchair, bearing wounds he sustained while attempting to defend his nation. “I think one of the most American things you can do is to speak your mind, to gather on a street corner and express yourself.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As in the dream, it is easy to pick off individuals one at a time, but perhaps the gathering of minds is a different matter. </p>

<p>Kelley’s article hits home. I was preparing to lead a writing retreat among the ancient stones and megaliths of Ireland, and had just read of the defeat of the Druids by the Romans.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The power of the Druids was so feared by the Romans that in 60 CE, their legions… made the crossing to the island of the dreamers and began the destruction of the sacred groves… With great effort the Roman governor, Suetonius Paulinus, rallied his men to attack this “band of females and fanatics… The next step… was to demolish the groves consecrated to their savage cults. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long these wars against the innocents have been going on! </p>

<p>The conventional woman in my dream has no difficulty killing the innocents; it is what she does, just as the militarists have been engaged in endless war for millennia. It is how things have been and it is what must be undone. We know that consciousness is real and so we can change and reintegrate ourselves into the ecology of creation. Why else would spirit have sent this dream at this time? </p>

<p>The woman aims at me with her rifle because I stand with the Elephant People. Let us not imagine for a moment that the aerial war against the wolves, the hunting by helicopter of elephants and rhinos, the conscription of dolphin into suicide missions, the devastation of the forests, the sacred groves, the mountains, the waters, air and land, the contamination of Mars with plutonium, the requisitioning of aboriginal lands and their resources everywhere, are not the same as the horrific acts of war we have witnessed and are living through in this and the last centuries against all the different peoples of this earth. </p>

<p>In the dream, I meet the violence and probably save my life by making an alliance with an elder anti-war activist. After a long common history, we still stand together. </p>

<p>Why this dream at this time, I asked and then looked for Ron’s recent activities, not even knowing if he is alive. Then I found the article about the talk he had just given. </p>

<p>In the dream, anti-war is anti-war. A No Enemy Way. At Daré, on Sunday, the 19th, a woman told a story of an old ghost in the attic of a church who asked for help cleaning up a mess. She knew it was his mess that he needed to clean. He had caused her family injury. She resented having to help. But when a ghost wants help in cleaning up the past… </p>

<p>I remember a line from a play I saw many years ago. The identity of a former Nazi officer living incognito among French resistance members is uncovered. Their intention is to kill him in retribution. “Hate the deed, but not the man,” he pleas for his own life. </p>

<p>The No-Enemy way is committed to undoing war without engaging in war. We will have to be so very clever, determined and dedicated to clean up the grand mess. We will have to do it together. Many of the peoples on the planet, like the Wolf People, the Elephant People, the Tree People, cannot defend themselves just as indigenous people have ultimately been unable to defend themselves against the warmongers over the years. And yet the planet must not die. </p>

<p>I met Ron Kovic in my dream last night. He stood up and I stood up next to him. Today, Day 119 before 2012, a dream calls me to stand up with / for the young lovers of the world, the Elephant People, and ‘the others,’ that is, for ourselves. ∞</p>

  <p><strong>Apokalypsis:</strong> (from the Greek) literally "revelation" or "a tearing away of the veil, of that which conceals" (kalyptein)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enantiodromia:</strong> The qualities or personas, carried to their extremes, tend to become their opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Editorial preface: When Michael and I were setting up this interview, I mentioned the shocking similarity of the dreams Michael built his book, 'Dreaming the End of the World' around and those received on this end as a result of our call for visionary dreams -resulting in this year's theme, Dreaming Humanity's Path. Similarity sufficient to cause trembling! This phenomenon, for me, confirms the essential message/story Psyche is communicating to the human community in these times.</em></p>

<p><strong>Roberta Ossana:</strong> Before we go into the heart of the crucial dreams and messages that you communicate in your book about them, will you share a little about yourself, your interest in dreams/especially dreams of apocalypse, and how the book came about?</p>

<p><strong>Michael Ortiz Hill:</strong> My background and education have definitely not been traditional. My mother is an artist and Mexican; her family goes back 250 years in Santa Fe, New Mexico My father was a Buddhist/Jungian intellectual. They met in the artist community in Santa Fe back in the 40's... so, I grew up in a certain ferment around artistic and psychic concerns. The beginning of my education was in my father's library, for sure! I was raised Catholic and learned the Buddha Dharma from my father when I was 15.</p>

<p>My own practice has been largely Buddhist. When I was a teenager, I was homeless for three years and I regard that period as the real ground of my education: on one hand it was three years sleeping under freeway bridges, rummaging through garbage cans; on the other hand, I sat in on classes at the university, spending a great deal of time reading in university libraries. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell were certainly my mentors. When I was homeless, a great deal of what I did was get an education. It was very deep, very rigorous and actually very devastating...  as one can imagine. What I call the apocalyptic rite of passage was first enacted in my life when I was on the street.</p>

<p>I rather reconstructed myself when I was in my twenties. Got a job working with dying people and began to piece myself together. I trained as a registered nurse and entered into a quasi-monastic Buddhist practice for 6 1/2 years, sitting zazen at the bedside of my patients during graveyard shift. So my work now is what I call curandeeismo, a Spanish word meaning that I do healing, both in the context of the hospital and doing ritual work with my wife, Deena Metzger. Dreams play a big part in all of this. I work very strongly with dreams with my patients/clients, also with the Tarot and doing ritual work. My training the last three years has been in Ifa, which is West African (Yoruba) religious tradition. That's my life in a nutshell.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6mhilli-1.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="Deena Metzger &amp; Michael Ortiz Hill"/></p>

<p>The dreams that I've collected for the book are about the end of the world, about apocalypse. Because I'm from New Mexico, originally and because of the circumstances of my background, I literally grew up under the shadow of the bomb. My father was born and raised at Alamogordo, which is where they blew up the first bomb... outside of town, there. And my mother's town, Santa Fe is very much in the shadow of Los Alamos.</p>

<p>My mother tells a remarkable story about when she was a teenager in the early forties, walking on the ridge near my grandfather's ranch with a nephew and pointing to the lights of Los Alamos—not having a clue what they were doing over there—and telling him that that was Santa Claus preparing Christmas for everybody!</p>

<p>So, I grew up within the mythology of the bomb, within the duck and cover generation. The terrors of the cold war were always an over-arching presence. I'm of a generation—the post Hiroshima generation—that truly did not believe we would live to be 20 years old. I grew up in an atmosphere that took apocalypse as a given.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> An extraordinary history, Michael. Thank you. It seems to me that the dreams and your narrative in the book, are re-telling or reframing the archetypal motifs of the Creation Story and Hero's Journey, in contemporary terms. Does this ring true for you?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> That's a very good point because one of the startling things is, if you look at the roots of what is called apocalypse in Western culture... if you look, for instance, to the roots of the Gospel and the revelations of St. John about apocalypse in the Old Testament, you go back to the old Babylonian stories of Marduk and the slaying of the primordial dragon, Tiamat. An ordered Universe, the sky and the stars, comes from the body of the slain dragon.</p>

<p>So, the story of apocalypse, at its root, is really the story of creation...not the story of the end of the world. It's the story of the end of one world and the beginning of another. So, you're absolutely right about that. </p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> That's how this time seems, like an updating of the Creation story and being on the threshold of creation. Let's hope! It can't get too much more chaotic.</p>

<p>There are some quotes from your book that orchestrate these archetypal stories—and which also outline the three stages of the Hero's Journey—which I would like to frame this interview around, if I may:</p>

<h2>DEPARTURE</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"This dream—the (collective) Dream at the End of the World—is the awakening of the Beast."</em> p.23</p>
  
  <p><em>"The Beast is an autonomous complex loose in the collective psyche..."</em> p.33</p>
  
  <p><em>"The Beast is very often associated with the realm under the ground."</em> p.25</p>
  
  <p><em>"Very often the Beast's violence is located specifically in its hunger."</em> p.25</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> What are some alternative, constructive suggestions you might make... what can be done to satisfy the hunger of the beast?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> There are two things that come to mind. One, I suppose has to do with my reflections on the beast the last few months. My wife and I have been talking about the vortex—our shorthand for this acceleration of time we're experiencing. Deena and I have been talking about this autonomous complex, this vortex, that we're drawn into and toward—where things just seem to speed up and speed up and speed up—and more and more is demanded of us and we try to keep pace with it and things literally start disintegrating around us. The feeling is that when you find all of your peers and most everything you see around you being drawn toward this acceleration, then there is more going on than a personal situation.</p>

<p>When I was his student years ago, Llama Sogyul Rimpoche used to talk about the Kali Yuga. Kali, is of course, the devouring mother from Tibetan and North Indian mythology. The Kali Yuga being the apocalyptic age, he used to speak of it in terms of a time of things accelerating and therefore disintegrating. So, in terms of the hunger of the Beast, there is way in which we are feeding our lives, our very selves, to this particular vortex. Lately, I've been struggling to re-imagine the vortex as a relentless demand to seize the present moment, carpe diem, to serve the sacredness of what is immediately present.</p>

<p>The other thing about feeding the Beast is that the passage through apocalypse is hopefully a passage to a much smaller and humbler way of seeing things. There's a big attraction to thinking apocalyptically...in enormous categories. There's a shift, it seems to me, between the Beast (with a capital B) and the animals. There's the little kangaroo rat that you see the track of in the desert. That's the shift to me, in terms of archetypically feeding the Beast. How do you "feed"—that is to say acknowledge and nurture—the world it lives in? The real question is, What is the Transition We Have to Make? so that we're weaned from these heroic, titanic battles between Messiah and Beast and come back to seeing the little particulars that surround us.</p>

<h2>INITIATION</h2>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> So when we're talking about an autonomous complex loose in the collective psyche and how we might satisfy the Beast's hunger...it seems to boil down to the individual and to a recognition of shadow, leading to the rite of passage or the Initiatory stage of the Journey. More quotes from your book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"The Messiah, crazy in his desire to eliminate the enemy, easily becomes the Beast."</em> p. 31</p>
  
  <p><em>"In this dream, (at the end of the world) Beast and Messiah co-habit the same image."</em> p. 42</p>
  
  <p><em>"It is in coming to terms with the reality of the Beast that our salvation lies."</em> p. 44</p>
  
  <p><em>"Sub-scending the madness of the 20th century means descending into the Underworld to be initiated there."</em> p. 45</p>
  
  <p><em>"The dream of apocalypse depends on descending into the Beast's lair with tenderness of heart..."</em> p. 44</p>
  
  <p><em>"Rather than enacting apocalypse in the world unconsciously, we deliberately enter the apocalypse of the psyche for the sake of the world."</em> p.53</p>
  
  <p><em>"We are far more likely to participate in the world's destruction by clinging to the fiction of our innocence than if we have a conscious and living relationship with the darker aspects of our own nature."</em> p. 53</p>
  
  <p><em>"...apocalyptic initiation may well require destruction; one's 'world falling apart' can be intrinsic to the way of transformation."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"The recognition of apocalypse begins with looking into the face of what is falling apart and finding it unbearable..."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"...the project of preserving the fiction of normality in an apocalyptic time is itself the opium of the masses."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"These dreams speak of the end of denial, both of what is going on and of our complicity in it."</em> p. 99</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> In these quotes, Beast and the Jungian concept of Shadow—or that which is not yet conscious—are relative, almost synonymous, are they not?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Yes, I think so, although when I speak of the Beast I'm talking about Shadow in a collective way... though obviously it's very personal, very intimately personal. When we speak of what we don't even want to know about ourselves, that's about as intimate as you can get.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> If Shadow has become a collective, autonomous complex, how do we each begin to do the work of withdrawing (shadow) projections? Of befriending the Beast?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> There's an initiation in looking the Beast in the eye and our transformation is literally in the arms of the Beast, so to speak. There's a recognition of the sacred here. What happens in the apocalyptic battle is that there's a raging between the Messiah and the Beast that feeds this energy and that is precisely what we have to withdraw from. It's not about fighting the Beast, it's about recognizing: Ah...I See! It's not the enemy "out there" that's trying to destroy the world. I myself am also participating.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Therein lies the paradox and the beauty in comprehending these realities. While the Beast is becoming visible—e.g. while we have collectively projected our shadow-side out into the world via wholesaling/marketing violence, via—as you speak about so eloquently in your book—the ravages that we're visiting upon Nature...the Beast has become so BIG! Yet each of us can only do our part, our own work. Can you, having been through the rites of passage many times yourself, offer courage and encouragement to people who have yet to make that passage?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Courage is a wonderful word, I think, because—as I understand the root of the word—courage is about coure, heart. How do we have heart?</p>

<p>Somebody was asking me what apocalypse actually was, psychologically and as I got to the core of it, I believe it's the image of heartbreak. I think our terrors of apocalypse are terrors of heartbreak, of things falling apart. Psychological apocalypse is the experience of the lament or the rage or the compassion of living in the world at this time. And it is heart breaking, it is terrifying in many respects. That part of it can't be diminished, can't be pretended away.</p>

<p>One classicist I quote in the book, L. R. Farnell, says that the quality that Hades holds—Hades being the God at the bottom of the underworld—in his primordial self is tenderness and melancholy.</p>

<p>My own experience in making this passage—for all the drama of going down, which can indeed be very excruciating at times—the bottom line of the experience is this quality of tenderness and melancholy. I work a great deal around the Greek myth of Hades and the Eleusinian mysteries and I always ask, "What will it require to change the hell of the Twentieth Century into a Hades of initiation, rather than look at this time as a period or place of damnation? What if we look at the particulars of living in this time as a rite of initiation?"</p>

<p>Initiation always serves the life energy and the life energy is the vitality within us and that is reliable. To move in that direction, to recover a portion of one's vitality, is a profound act.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, American culture is a fundamentalist culture in many respects. It proliferates fundamentalisms and about 80% of what passes as ethics in this country is about identifying an enemy and throwing one's life force into fighting it! It's better than not being ethically committed, I suppose but there's very little imaginative space for what might be an ethics of reconciliation. When I work on the dream level, the question is, "How does one apply an ethics of reconciliation? How does one reconcile oneself with these aspects that are hugely troublesome, disruptive and confusing?" One can rely on the ego psychology that fights them to the bitter end but we all know that, in itself, drives us crazy.</p>

  <p><em>"These dreams show that the Beast may well be presenting to us one of the many faces of God."</em> p. 145</p>
  
  <p><em>"One cannot behold the birth of light out of darkness without having been first rendered naked."</em> p.131</p>
  
  <p><em>"The light is revealed when one no longer knows who one is—when one is a mystery to oneself."</em> p. 131</p>

  <p><em>Therefore, Cultivate Compassion!</em> Title, chapter 13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Here, in the midst of apocalypse—as we approach the threshold of the new forms/the new creation story—how do we dream, Now, the beginning of the world?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I'm going to answer on two tracks here, one which may seem a bit elliptical. One thing I noticed in apocalyptic dreams of the Compassionate One is that he or she only appears after the apocalypse. It's fascinating! The Compassionate One in apocalyptic dreams is not the one who saves the world. The one who saves the world has a very different character. Before apocalypse, there's a trickster character, who is like an animal that will do anything to survive. One who is trying, in trickster fashion, to sabotage the machinery that would generate apocalypse. So this is one figure in the psyche, the one who will save the world.</p>

<p>The Compassionate One comes after the world has been rendered to ash. I speak of that act of binding together, of storytelling. One woman dreamt of the feet of the wounded children while she led them out of the devastation to a greener world. There's a difference here between the view of before the apocalypse and after the apocalypse. Before and after the apocalypse are two different ways of speaking about where we're at now; two different windows in which to look at the present time. So, we're asked to carry a duplex sensibility, two contradictory images of where we're at now, two contradictory forms of activity.</p>

<p>Again, we have to come to the willingness to let our hearts break. To let the simple shape of the human being emerge: uninflated, tender and with an acceptance of the limitations of being human, with all our flaws. Striving for perfection is...it's simply a distraction. We're not perfectible beings and our beauty is not in our perfectibility. I believe that heartbreak and the willingness to live lives that have a human shape, lives that are responsible is the way we wake up from the dream at the end of the world.</p>

<p>Because the bomb is no longer the primary image, there is an archetypal shift in the apocalyptic psyche. Now we're imaging apocalypse as the unraveling of nature—which of course was happening all along—the bomb was just eclipsing it. Greek myth talks about the Furies, the ones who torment, harass and cause miasma—bad blood or poison blood—to those who violate the Earth, the Mother.</p>

<p>My feeling is that we're moving into a more horizontal mode. We're not looking up to the sky, to the bomb coming down anymore. We are beginning to recognize that our human lives are being shaped by the presence of other beings that are not human. They surround us, they shape us. How do we live in a way that honors that humans exist within a mosaic of communities? It is said that between 30 and 50 million species live on this planet, each of which is a community in and of itself. So, one can enter into that reality—this thin film of life called the biosphere that envelopes this planet and that vibrates as we walk in the midst of it. It has always beckoned to our hearts to listen. Right now, nothing is more crucial than learning the art of listening.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Oh, thank you for sharing your thoughts and your time, Michael.</p>

<h2>The Oceans Above, The Sky Below: A Dream</h2>

<p><em>I have been to a huge party in some kind of military compound, or military headquarters—either Air Force or NASA—and one of the officers wants to show me something. I sensed that this man was not only lonely but also alone, in that he knew something that nobody else knew. Some sort of secret mission. He wanted to show me what it was.</em></p>

<p><em>He takes me into a room that has what looks like an aircraft trainer in it, with seats for a pilot and passenger. He straps me into the passenger seat, makes sure I have a helmet securely strapped on, shows me how to "sight" in something like a rifle sight. (What am I going to be "sighting?") then he gets up into the pilot's seat, presses a button on the stick and we're immediately catapulted into outer space! It happens so fast that it fairly takes my breath away. We hover there for a few minutes, then we're suddenly back in the training room. He mentally tells me to go get something (what?) and come back to do this again. I wander through the halls but don't know which door to go into to get whatever it is I'm supposed to get. Finally, I go into a room full of officers who are just standing around and talking. I ask the one who seems to outrank the others where is this Colonel that I'm supposed to assist. He looks at me with disdain. The others turn around to stare at me as though they thought "Who do you think you are, to be assisting Colonel what's-his-name in such a secret project?" The officer studies me for a minute and then says "Oh, yes, you must be Maria" indicating that he knows this Colonel has need of me. He leads me through the hall toward the training room.</em></p>

<p><em>I say, "Yes, we lifted off a while ago and I must admit I was scared pea-green at first but then I began to enjoy it." He smirks and says: "Yes, I guess there are some people who enjoy doing something different." I wonder what he means by this. Suddenly, before we get to the training room, I see we are in this huge room. It is round, like a transparent bubble. There are windows all around, from floor to domed ceiling and the ceiling is also transparent, like a domed skylight. There is something like a ballet bar against the right side of the wall. Suddenly, the entire bubble-room tilts sharply to the right and everything and everybody starts sliding and falling against the opposite wall. Some of them are yelling, all wondering what in the world is going on.</em></p>

<p><em>The officer who was leading me is the most nonplused by it all. I say to him: "Well, there's something different going on right now and we're all experiencing it." I'm frightened, wondering what it is and what all these people think about it and what's going to happen to Planet Earth. Suddenly, in a flash, I know that the Earth's poles are shifting and what was "up" is now going "down" and vice-versa. It's like the oceans will be above and the sky will be below...a complete REVERSAL of what once was and it would probably mean the extinction of life as we now know it. Not "life" per se but "life as we now know it."</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The River of Light by Lawrence Kushner. Published by Rossel Books, Chappaqua, N.Y., 1981</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Even with its descriptive subtitle, <em>Spirituality, Judaism, and the Evolution of Consciousness</em>, Lawrence Kushner's book THE RIVER OF LIGHT would hardly find its way into the hands of someone looking for the latest good book on dreams. A friend recommended I read it because the first chapter was about dreaming. I found the whole book was. "The dreams we have dreamed are none other than the lives we live," Kushner writes in his simple, profoundly penetrating prose, "We made the dream. We wrote, are writing, and will rewrite again its lines. Shifting its selves and plots and scenery and sequences in accordance with our abilities to endure awareness." </p>

<p>Our ability to endure awareness: that's it! We can only admit so much of reality into our conscious mind then the picture becomes too painfully at odds with the script that society or our parents or we ourselves have devised for us to survive by. That script is called deadness neurosis. It's our survival tactics that get in the way. The secret is that more than survival is possible. We can prevail, we can transform. We can become beings of light. Our dreams don't make sense to us because our lives make no sense. What comes up pure from within is distorted as it nears the surface of our consciousness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Unable to withstand the going up from our depths, enough to remain in its simple form, it cloaked itself in mystery, transformed intolerable desires into dense imagery and words, deleted the 'good parts', substituting them with parts that seemed 'good'. Now all we have left is the piously handed down scroll. filled with square black letters, the spaces between them, and of course, our own fragmented memories of a dream... Once a dream is told, it becomes something else. No sooner has it been recorded or told or even remembered then it ceases to be a dream. Now it is part of waking, it is torn from what shines beneath it and bore it, no longer part of the totality, only a story, perhaps. Waking consciousness closes out more than it lets in." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way waking consciousness has of closing things out is to compartmentalize. We learn new ways of perception from working with dreams but don't apply these to our waking life, which is only a lived dream; or to films and literature, which are merely externalized dreams. Kushner is a rabbi, not a psychotherapist. He obtains his material from the source that is most familiar to him. "Not long ago," he writes, "we dreamt the Bible. From deep within our several and collective unconsciousness, we brought it forth. Twisted, convoluted, and mysterious. But nevertheless true... By reading holy literature as if it were a dream, we gain access to a primary mode of our collective unconsciousness." If the Bible is an ancient product of the dreams we are all still dreaming, though imperfectly aware of, then it follows that the techniques of dreamworkers can properly be applied to it to yield a blueprint of our own psyche and an understanding of the processes by which we undergo transformation and renewal. The Old Testament abounds with short, clipped and seemingly disconnected passages. "There isn't much left to work with " Kushner observes, "like with a dream."</p>

<p>The techniques Kushner employs are not unfamiliar. Yet he seems to draw them from a different, or perhaps earlier, tradition. For instance, here is how he presents what certain dreamworkers would call a "rewrite": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This deliberate leaving of the text of the 'remembered dream', creating a story and returning to the next word, is called, in Hebrew, Midrash. Not the creation of a story from out of thin air, which is called 'fantasy'. Nor the elaboration of one word or event and returning to this same word or event, which is called 'commentary'. But the deliberate filling in of the gap between two words. Not to dissolve their individuality, but to fuse them into the even greater totality from which they have risen and of which they are only a part. This is called <em>Midrash.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kushner's aims, likewise, are as refreshingly stated as they are familiar: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Health (to heal, to make whole) is the result of connecting the discordant and apparently unrelated pieces. And illness is pretending (or believing) that what is broken is really whole... Because we do not perceive our actions as responsible to previous events... our lives seem to be ruled by the caprice of distant, uncaring powers. Our joy is irrelevant. And our grief is unbearable. On the other hand, if we can create a story connecting one 'fragment' of our lives with another and thus join with <em>Midrash</em>-gossamer like webs those separate fragments of our existence, there is now a sentence where before there were only words. Meaning is literally in the connections. And meaninglessness obtains when the events in our lives seem to us unrelated, discordant, and fragmentary... If Scripture is like a dream, the <em>Midrash</em> is like therapy. It is the creative process whereby some of what is concealed is brought to the light of awareness... Unconscious thoughts, repressed and out of sight, exert more force than those that have risen to the surface. It is what we once saw, imagined, planned, and knew as a child but have now forgotten that can free us. Indeed it is from their hiddenness that they derive their immense power. The force of any secret to control human transactions is well known." </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The River of Light</em> abounds with the simplicity and insight that comes from working with dreams. To quote again from the book: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"By the time you're old enough to do what you've been waiting to be old enough to do, it has all changed into a world that you did not make or want... Ultimately, all we seek to learn is what we as children once knew. All genuine learning is this the self's disclosure to itself. How odd and yet how universal the misconception, on the part of all who would learn, that the knowledge they seek is outside them ... Go down through your layers, through your childhood and your dreams... For the layers run back through time but also run all the way down to the source..." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How beautifully Kushner writes and how impossible to sum up his book except in his own words. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The one who pays attention to the dreams, draws on them, and lives them out is blessed, even as the one who dreams is also dreamt. We each take our turn at living out the dream. Like some ageless wave, Scripture flows through us ... The Bible's image for the resolution of all paradox is the coming of the Messiah. The final transformation of consciousness itself ... The coming of the Messiah does not depend upon anything supernatural, but rather upon human growth and self-transformation... The world will only be transformed... when people realize that the Messiah is not someone wholly other than themselves. Knowledge of the self at the deepest level is, simultaneously, knowledge of God." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we work with our dreams or the dreams of others we are not dealing with anything different than the writers of the Old Testament dealt with. It is perhaps a reflection of our diminution of consciousness more than anything else that our own tradition appears as mysterious and impenetrable to us as the dreams we dream. Because of the state of mind we have fallen into these traditions must be worked with just as we work with dreams. "We are not simply custodians of a tradition", Kushner writes, "not just keepers of a museum. Our goal is also to break it open. Set it free." In this task Lawrence Kushner has succeeded remarkably well. <em>The River of Light</em> belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in dreams and in personal transformation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If we believe that dreams are sent by Spirit to enlighten us, to teach and instruct us in how to live, this dream calls for empathy and deep compassion. </p>

<p>How might we find non-conventional ways to support the President so that he can act in accordance with the soul promises he made and believed in? How might we help protect him from the exigencies, dangers, the insanity of these times, and from the old guard that always surrounds a president? </p>

<p>How might we be alongside him so he can be alongside himself? How can we be alongside him so that he can govern, as I believe he wants to do, with absolute integrity? How can we, together, step out of the pattern of fear, conflict, violence, and on-going judgement that is overwhelming the country, while also finding the viable ways to justice, peace and restoration? </p>

<p>How might we, together, read and live accordingly to the ten questions on the cover of the book? How do we incorporate the possible answers in our daily lives on behalf of the future and all beings? </p>

<p>Here’s another question: What were the ten questions on the cover of the book that, if addressed, offer transformation?</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I am or she is holding the photo and speaking to him, or he is the face in the photo, and I am or she is saying, “No, you will not kill.” He, as a revolutionary, or they, together, they will do what they must, what they have been doing, what has been necessary, but they are here in this country, this Spain of the Imagination and they will leave without killing. Killing will not be the last act. Killing is not sanctioned. I am, or she is, adamant. </p>

<p>But now I am the Mother in a Spain of the Imagination and I am going to the Teacher. I open the door. I tell her that I am here on my knees. I fall to my knees and I am before her. One can only fall to the knees before someone one trusts implicitly. We are women in a Spain of the Imagination. We have dark hair, our faces are strong and clear, we wear black skirts and white blouses. But if we wore only black you would not be surprised. </p>

<p>I tell her that I have come about my daughter. She is sixteen or she is eighteen. She is the Daughter. She will not kill. I will not allow it. It is not to protect the victim; it is to protect my daughter. She is a revolutionary as we all are, as we must be. But, I tell the teacher with whom I am now collaborating, who understands everything, that I will send the daughter away. She will go to another country. I cannot send her to the United States. It is not a country of such women as we are or we have become. It is not a country that forbids killing. </p>

<p>That young man will go to another country too. That young man who is her partner, in the way the man was my partner earlier, when I held the photo or the portrait and knew that he must not and so would not kill. They will not kill. </p>

<p>I speak this to the Teacher. I am or was on my knees and she was seated on a wooden chair by the windows in the classroom that is empty of children. I fall to my knees and then I rise up. It is possible that I am also the teacher. It is possible that there is only one person in this dream and it is myself and I am playing all the roles. No, I am not playing roles. I am everyone in the dream as I must be because it is a dream and that is how the dream teaches us as there are no others in a dream, there is only what we know or what is being told to us by the dream which is the one that, ultimately, knows what needs to be known. </p>

<p>This is the dream. But it is a dream from a world of the imagination that birthed me when I was a young girl or a young woman and when killing (despite Guernica, despite World War II, despite Hiroshima and Nagasaki) was not killing a person but an act that created another world. In such dreams of language, killing was a word not an act. It was a word that led to another world. Killing was a word, an act that had to come to an end in a dream of life, of words come to life like <em>justice</em> or <em>freedom</em>. A dream of a world in which killing was not ever to have to kill a body that could not understand the horror of killing. To kill and not to kill were the same because they created the world we had to create so that the killing would be over.</p>

<p>It was a world I recognized in an imaginary literature of Spain where I have never been. It was a world I was born into through the dreams I do not remember that have rhythms that might be flamenco and which I found again in the rhythms of the poetry and the literature of Latin America. A dream where the light is different than it is here because of the stone houses I have never seen and will never see, and the way the light fell on them in the curved and cobbled streets of the imagination. Dreams of dark forests, where the trees call the black shadows to them and whisper in a Spanish language that lives only in poetry at night. </p>

<p>In these dreams that are not dreams so much as patterns in other worlds, the women knew what they had to know although their mothers wore veils and were silent and sequestered behind walls in cities called the Alameda or Alhambra, the Red. In the languages of these worlds, the men told the stories of what the women were not to know despite the red, despite the red and the black, despite the red roses, the white walls, the casement windows, the barred windows, or the windows without bars that dreamed of light that was brilliant and dark. </p>

<p>The men who wrote the stories did not know what the women knew and were passing on to the daughters, the daughters who come to me now at this time in my life in my dream. The daughters who are straight and tall, who are revolutionaries in black skirts, who have red lips and carry red roses and will not kill. The women who will not kill, so killing is forbidden. That is how strong they are. </p>

<p>The women say, “This is what we taught you then in the dreams that came to you when you were young, the dreams that you have forgotten that came to you in your childhood, the dreams that formed you and surface now at this time in your life when you are asking what is to be done, what is to be done, what is to be done?” </p>

<p>Dreams, like this one, of the photo of the man who, at the end of what he is to do, is not to kill. The photo is not of the man who is to be killed. The photo of the man with the white face or the dark face with a beard is a photo of a man, who ultimately, because he is the revolutionary, the one who brings justice like the sunlight or the rain, will not kill. The woman says so and so it is so. That is what the dream says. And it says that all of this, the story, the strength, the strength not to kill, the strength that ends killing is in language, in the rhythm of the words, and this is what we have forgotten. Earth, rhythm, language, light, they were to have come together in a poetry from which the future might have arisen if we had listened and learned to speak that language, its rhythms and images, to speak it’s absolute poetry. </p>

<p>But then we forgot or yielded to the trance, to the relentless noise from which our cities dull as old metal and gray egg cartons arise in the fluorescent lights of super markets and endless parking lots and deluded malls which have no music to them and so are not the languages that we had been given to heal the world. </p>

<p>And because of this, because it may not be too late, the dream comes, the dream in another language, the dream in which the woman says, adamantly, “The man, my lover, the woman, my daughter, we will not kill. At the end of the dream, at the end of the dreams, we will not kill.”</p>

<p>Whether you are a seasoned dream worker or relatively new to exploring the dreamscape, Jill Mellick has something of value to offer in her book <em>The Art of Dreaming</em>. An intelligent writer who has worked closely with renowned Jungian analyst Marion Woodman, Jill Mellick respects her readers’ intelligence and innate capacity to draw their own conclusions regarding dreams. Rather than presenting trite, narrowing definitions of dream material, Dr. Mellick suggests quick and surprisingly simple ways to delve deeper into dream images and open them to larger meaning, helping ground them in the context of waking life. Using creative tools such as word play, mask making, mapping, clay, drama and dance, <em>The Art of Dreaming</em> is as practical as it is poetic. Mellick shows dreamers how to work in their own way and that dreamwork does not need to be tedious or overly analytical. </p>

<p>Sections include Expressive Dream Work in 5 minutes, Expressive Dream Work in 10-15 minutes, Expressive Dream Work with Nightmares, Expressive Dream Work with Recurring Dreams and Series, as well as The Care and Feeding of Dream Figures and Animals. There is also an extremely helpful set of guidelines for establishing a working dream group as well as a glistening and thoughtful bibliography. For anyone looking to delve more deeply into the mysteries of the unconscious, this book provides inspiring techniques to further tend the images of the soul as they appear in our dreams. ℘</p>

<p>At once tender and powerful, <em>The Dreaming Way</em> chronicles a two-year relationship between artist and dreamer Susan Snow and her therapist Patricia Reis. Dreams and their accompanying artwork are presented together with commentary by each woman, allowing the sometimes gentle and sometimes fierce dreamscape to unfold. As readers, we become co-journeyers in this process, meeting all the places where memory and dreaming intersect. All of the initial awe, power and mystery of the dream are preserved for the reader, and we are allowed to be the proverbial fly on the wall during these amazing sessions. </p>

<p>Following the presentation of the session material, there is commentary on both the artistic, the creative process Susan followed and also a reflection by Reis on the teachings drawn from the dreamwork. A retrospective conversation with Annie G. Rogers follows, further unveiling the magnificence of this empathic, healing collaboration. <em>The Dreaming Way</em> is a testament to the power of a safe therapeutic container and to the possibility of recovery offered to victims of trauma when voice is risked and the thread of creativity and dream is followed within it. Whether you are an artist, dreamer or therapist, you will find something of value in this unique and precious offering.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Dreamways of the Iriquois, Published 2004 by Destiny Books, 288 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Some books I tend to fall right into. The author is immediately credible, my heart is engaged. The message is genuine. In reviewing these books, I almost don’t have to read every word; I just do because I am enriched by the author’s contribution. I savor and value every word. With Moss’ latest contribution to the dream literature, <em>Dreamways of the Iroquois</em>, I wanted to feel that way. I wanted to believe in his work, his writings, his message and his vision and hopes, his true and deep belief in the possibility and potential of dreaming, but his ego kept getting in the way. I kept reading, hoping the information would be new, that depth would creep in, and that the writing would begin to click the way it does in a good book. I continued to hope that the author’s egocentricity would fall away and allow the messages from the dreamtime to speak on their own behalf. Despite his best efforts, Moss failed to accomplish these tasks. I believe that this failure clouded the message of this book. This is quite a sad thing indeed. Who else but Moss would conduct a workshop and use his own dreams to illustrate the technique he is trying to teach?! </p>

<p>Perhaps I am cynical, though. Had I encountered Island Woman or had the amazing visitations and dreams, both sleeping and waking, that Moss did; if those synchronicities had occurred in my life; and if I began dreaming in an ancient language that turned out to be Iroquois, I might feel chosen and special too. I might well have been puffed with self importance. Yet these pathways do exist, and I applaud his efforts and diligence in transmitting this information, these vital dreamways to other worlds and other times, so that they are not irretrievably lost. Whether he chose the Iroquois path, that of the Santeria, or of the Kogi or other indigenous peoples, Moss has traveled and learned a lot. </p>

<p>The book is an odd mixture in four parts. Part one consists of Moss’s personal story of leaving his success-filled life and the spontaneous dreaming that seemed to spring from the land itself. Mythistory comprises part 2, dreamed, not channeled, information from various time travels and shamanic journeys, retelling the creation myth, the stories of Sky Woman, Hiawatha and the battling light and dark Twins. Moss states that he has lived and dreamed these stories, but omits what that means exactly. As with most of this book, we take it on faith, believing in the power and truth of dreams. Part 3 delivers the wisdom of Island Woman in her own voice. She reminds us that we have souls and how desperately important that is in today’s often apathetic world. She tells us that dreams require action and that we can travel forward or back in time in our dreams. We are reminded that we have power animals and of the potential for power to be used in service to either the dark or the light. Part 4 brings the ancient dreamways to our daily lives, Moss’s Shaman at the breakfast table, so to speak. In this section of the book, he outlines what he terms <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em>, a quick and easy way to extract essence from a dream. Soul loss, dreaming for others, dream journals, dream theater, creating dream talismans and dream poetry are all discussed. We are shown ways to bring the images and messages contained in our dreams into full use, as medicine for us individually and as a troubled culture. </p>

<p>If you love dreams and dreaming, if you already or are ready to believe in their power, potential, and possibility to transport you across time and space, to be precognitive, to demonstrate pathways to healing and other worlds; if you have ever wanted to shed the corporate shuffle and live from your heart, and if you can compassionately forgive and read through an author’s egoist inflation, then this book is certainly for you. Moss’s desire to “help rebirth a dreaming culture” is important. His passion for using dreams for healing both personally and collectively is an intent worth holding and nurturing. As global consciousness is brought to higher levels and we choose to listen and learn from our dreams, we must remember that they are a divine language that we share, not only between human beings, but with the animal and natural worlds as well.</p>

  <p><em>"For the Days of the Lord are coming... And it shall come to pass afterward, saith God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.

</blockquote>

<h2>Part One</h2>

<p>Prophecies of the End of Time, the Apocalypse, abound all over the world. And the clues give evidence that they arise from the DreamTime. Three things have intrigued me all my life: dreaming, myth and the concept of time; they have led me on strange journeys, inward and outward. Recently, I was wandering in Asia and years ago, did a stint with the Peace Corp. in South America. </p>

<p>While in Asia, I spent almost a month practicing Vipassna meditation at a monastery in the north of Thailand. Immediately afterward, I went south to a predominantly Muslim area. Here I read the Koran, with its continual theme of the Resurrection Day, as I listened to the periodic Islamic call to prayer echoing through the salty air. All of this is flavored with the fact that I grew up in an Evangelical Christian household and constantly heard of the Second Coming of Christ and the Apocalypse. </p>

<p>Ever since I was a child, the moment between waking and sleeping, consciousness and subconsciousness, has tantalized me, lured me into wanting to experience more of that timeless state. This exceptional moment is illusive, seemingly ungraspable—sometimes a moment of profound wisdom and tranquility, sometimes a clandestine moment of fear. It is a moment of strange awareness—realization of my own mortality and the world's impermanence. It seems a hazy window into the realm of death and deathlessness beyond... just out of reach. That ‘time’ is our personal prophet peering into the End of Time. </p>

<p>When I was an adolescent, I slept in late one Saturday morning. I had a long and elaborate dream about our German shepherd. At the dream's conclusion, <em>I saw her run into the path of our load truck as it was backing out of the driveway. I heard a sounding thud, then a yelp.</em> I awoke to hear commotion outside my bedroom window. Later that day I asked my dad and brothers if something had happened to our dog that morning. "Yes, she got in the way of the truck as we were backing out and was hit. Fortunately, she wasn't seriously hurt," my dad said. </p>

<p>"Could it be that my entire dream about our German shepherd had occurred within that split second when she was hit by the truck?" I wondered. Other previous dream experiences gave evidence to this theory. This was the beginning of a hypothesis: time is relative to each individual's state of consciousness and this mystery of time can be explored in that moment between sleeping and waking, subconsciousness and consciousness. </p>

<p>Isn't all of Nature subject to endless cycles of lying dormant and awakening? It is at the time of dying that plants go to seed. And the seed's sprouting is the moment of resurrection, of waking. Falling asleep and dying: are they really any different from one another? When we die, so our conception of Time dies with us; and hence, so ends Time itself. This is what Logic and Intuition together lead me to understand. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6msapoc-0.jpg" width=300 height="auto"/></p>

<p>I have since noticed how lucid dreaming occurs when my consciousness straddles the line between waking and sleeping; it seems a consciousness that can simultaneously see into both realms. I always wanted to experiment further into this realm by keeping myself awake for several nights. However, I lacked the stamina.... until I came to the Buddhist monastery. Gautama Buddha discovered, some 500 years before Christ, that the cycles of Time and suffering could be transcended through what he called "the Middle Path" or "the Eightfold Path." Training the mind to follow this path is the point of Vipassna meditation. Buddhists also call it focusing on the Present Moment, not letting the mind stray to either the future or the past. This, I realized, is also the point of the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly in his Sermon on the Mount: Keep your eye "single," focusing on now rather than worrying about yesterday or tomorrow. In the Torah of Jesus' faith, the unspeakable Name of God—discovered by Moses at the burning bush—is a play on the Hebrew word for "to be." It roughly means "the Eternal Present." When I shared this fact with my Vipassna meditation teachers, they were delighted. From then on they often reminded me to keep my focus on the Eternal Present. My teachers gave me day-to-day assignments of walking and sitting meditation. I was clueless as to what they had in mind for me the next day or in the "grand finale" of my meditation practice. I often complained how sleepy I was becoming. Even so, they continued to tell me to reduce the time I slept each night. </p>

<p>Toward the end of my instruction, they told me to go twenty-four hours without sleeping, with a particular walking and sitting meditation assignment. After the twenty-four hours, I thought my ordeal was finished... but they surprised me again, telling me to go another twenty-four hours without sleeping. Following that, I had to go yet another twenty-four hours of sleeplessness, making a total of three days and three nights of without sleep! One of my assignments was to tabulate how many times I nodded off during meditation. This they called "Arising and Ceasing." Eventually it dawned on me that this Arising and Ceasing was that very moment I had wanted to capture! This was that moment between sleeping and waking: the Middle Path, the Eternal Present! </p>

<p>I was so exhausted it was unbearable. I was tempted to lie down and slumber it all away. I finally gave up on the lotus position and crouched on the floor with my head on my knee. That way I could rest a little more and hopefully not fall entirely asleep. I was coming to the point of giving up. "If I sleep, I sleep. If I don't, I don't. I just don't care any more," I finally thought, with my head resting on my knee in resignation. Then, something I'd never experienced before unexpectedly happened. Indescribable peace fell over me. I noticed a fading person with his head on his knee. I honestly didn't know who this person was, whether it was me or the Buddha or someone else. I lost all conception of "I" and "me." Then there was no-body. All senses and all thought ceased. All was blank, empty. The closest description I can share is that all was a pale blue light of emptiness. No pain, no-thing, just utter peace and silence. This experience lasted perhaps 20 minutes—I’m not sure. I felt I could have stayed there forever, but I also felt the urge to come back. When I did, I was completely awake, rejuvenated, refreshed, and blissfully at peace, as if I'd had the best sleep in my life. Then I understood why "Buddha" means "awakened one."</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h2>Part Two</h2>

<p>After leaving the monastery, I remembered that three days and three nights signifies death and resurrection, or transformation in many mythologies of the world. For example, the Sumerian goddess Inanna dies and is hung on a pole in Hell for three days and three nights before she resurrects. Jonah spends three days and three nights in the whale's belly. Jesus says that the Son of Man must spend three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth. The moon is obscured for three days and three nights. </p>

<p>The heart of the earth, the center of the world, the Middle Path: this concept is the factor that links the world's myths and gives us a clue into the End of Time, the Apocalypse. It is the Dream Time. Curiously, in mythologies throughout the world, we find there is a divine incarnation who descends, dies, and resurrects at the Middle of the World, at the Center of the Cross of the junction of the four directions. This Center is the clashing of opposites and the union of compliments into ultimate oneness. This union is often represented by the central axis of the Pyramid, with four corners converging into the fifth, which is the apex. This union is also commonly represented by the Tree of Life, the Axis at the Center of the four realms of the world. The Sumerian incarnation of the goddess Inanna, the Norse Woden, the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, and the North American Corn Maiden, to name a few; each descend, die, and resurrect at the Center of the World, of the Cross. Another variation on this theme is the universal myth of the Great Deluge. In Native American mythologies, the Tree of Life at the Center of the Cross becomes the ladder of Salvation by which people and animals ascend from the flooded underworld to rebirth into a New World. In many cultures, this Tree of Life is hollowed out or constructed into a boat that carries earthly creatures to Salvation. </p>

<p>In the Dhamapada—the sayings of the Buddha—we read that Death overtakes all creatures as a flood overtakes a sleeping village. Buddha's teaching, the Middle Path, is called the Canoe that carries us to Salvation. Similarly, Jesus compares the End of the World, the End of Time, to Noah's flood. Both Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha say the same thing: we must keep vigilant, lest the flood overtake us. The Koran similarly says we must keep vigilant, lest the Apocalypse overtake us unawares. </p>

<p>Our mistake down through the centuries has been to interpret the Apocalypse as a day on the calendar, a point in linear time, rather than the ever-present Center beyond Time and Space. We will all be swallowed into this Center, sooner or later. It is the Eternal Present, the Middle Path between future and past. The ancient prophets, whether they lived 1500, 2000 or 2500 years ago, always said the same thing: the Apocalypse is "at hand," and it will come upon "this generation." This concept has had overly-logical religious scholars confused for millennia! </p>

<p>Notice that in various world mythologies—such as Aztec, Greek, Hindu, Babylonian and Jewish—the prophecies each speak of time divided into four periods, with a fifth period (or end of the fourth) being the time of Apocalypse. Each period is represented by the astrological elements of the four seasons: Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. Each of these cultures also agrees that the fifth (or end of the fourth) is the time of "mixture." In India, Israel, Greece, and Babylon, these ages were represented as Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, and Mixture. In India, Mesoamerica and North America, these ages are represented by the colors or castes of the human race dispersed into the four realms of the earth, with the fifth being the End... when all the colors or castes mix and the boundaries between hierarchies dissolve. This fifth age is one of contradicting chaos or unifying salvation, depending on the perspective.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament book of Daniel, these same mythic motifs are the dreams of the Babylonian emperor Nebuchanezzar. And these are the motifs Jesus refers to in the New Testament. In his first dream, Nebuchanezzar sees these four ages: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, and Mixture. In his second dream, he sees the World Tree, dying and resurrecting. Yes, this is the Dream Time we are peering into. </p>

<p>In the Old Testament book of Ezekiel and the New Testament book of Revelation, these four ages metamorphose into the four Beasts of the Zodiac, representing the four seasons of Time: The Calf (Taurus), the Eagle (Scorpio), the Lion (Leo), and the Man (Aquarius), with the fifth, the mysterious Divine Incarnation, at the Center. In Aztec myth, each of these four ages is represented by a god, a color and an astrological element. The fourth is the mortal Quetzalcoatl, and the fifth is the immortal Quetzalcoatl. This is comparable to the Bible's fourth image: the mortal Aquarius the Man, and the fifth Son of Man in the Center of the four. </p>

<p>Because of our desire to escape the Present Moment, we love to put our hope in Apocalyptic events on the calendar, whether we speak of Christ's coming, the Age of Aquarius or Y2K. But have we forgotten that Capricorn follows Aquarius, starting us over again? Have we forgotten that a galaxy takes millions of years to make one revolution? Have we forgotten that there are four ages within four ages, following for ages <em>ad infinitum</em>? Hinduism calls these ages Yugas and clearly points out their infinite nature. </p>

<p>The fourth age seems like the age of Salvation. Many people perceive the imminent Age of Aquarius as the coming of the time of hope.... and this is why it can be deceptive. Good times are often deceptive, because we cling to them. Hence, in reality, the end of the fourth age—rather than its beginning—truly does become the time of Salvation for many, not because it is a time of prosperity and hope but because it is a time of disillusionment. We finally see that the age of hope comes to an end and we are right back where we started: Disillusioned. </p>

<p>This is when we realize that our only true hope, our only joy, is to accept the Present Moment, to submit to it through good and bad, with all of our being, all of our strength. </p>

<p>Surely good times come, then bad times come. Good karma, bad karma. The four beasts of the Apocalypse, the four ages of the Zodiac, revolve forever and ever and ever in the wheel of Samsara around the Central Fifth, rising and bowing before the Throne, as we read in the book of Revelation. </p>

<p>The Central Fifth is the Eternal Present. It is Mohammed's Day of Resurrection, Krishna's and Buddha's Middle Path, Lao Tsu's Tao, Moses' Day of the Lord, and the Australian Shaman's DreamTime. It is the I AM. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I believe ‘The End of Time’ will merely be the end of our perception of time as we now measure it with clock and calendar. If we can't find our contentment within the Present—through good and bad, at the center of the Cross of contradictions and compliments— then we'll never find contentment and our waiting for Salvation at the End of Time will have been in vain. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Theater director Steven Kent and I had not expected to be working together again on a creative project related to dreams at this time in our lives. In advance of producing <em>Dreams Against the State</em> in 1981, he and I had recreated the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece in 1980 for the first time in 1500 years. I had written the play and Steve was the dramaturge and director. The first production of the play was performed in fifty different venues: private homes, community centers, churches, etc. This deliberate variation on performance space was designed to emphasize the real life danger to dreams and dreaming in our culture and the need for individuals and communities to provide sanctuary for dreams. </p>

<p>Thirty-two years later, in January 2014, we were co-teaching a class on <em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> at La Verne University where Steven is a faculty member of the Theater Arts Department. This project is, perhaps, the closed parenthesis of a creative partnership devoted to theater, ritual, transformation and the inner life. </p>

<p>The creative premise of the class was that the students comprise a theater troupe that visits communities to perform their dreams, and at the same time, are themselves a community whose dreams are explored and reflected upon, theatrically, by the theater troupe. We were imaging being called into a community to enact the dreams in order to help resolve conflicts or disagreements in creative ways.</p>

<p>Because this class, as conceived, is a unique exploration and a first for Steven and myself, we have been surprised and gratified by the unanticipated directions it has taken. During our first meeting, I was startled to realize what fifty years of working with dreams had not revealed before: the essential connection between dream and theater. Dreams come to us as complete theater events, remarkably scripted, directed, enacted and staged. However, in recalling and communicating our dreams, though we may access meaning, we rarely, if ever, transmit the quality and intensity of the dream experience itself. Enter theater. </p>

<p><em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> met four times a week for four hours during the January Interterm at La Verne University, La Verne California. Ancient Greek Aesclepian medicine considered the union of dreaming and theater as essential to the healing process. Steven and I have visited the ruins of the Aesclepian healing sanctuaries in Greece, but the living theater is long gone; and though the transformational aspect of the Mysteries was preserved in our work, we did not recreate our dreams theatrically when relating them to each other every day. So, in this class we found ourselves exploring a new form with remarkably ancient antecedents. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, the limitations of working in a classroom with essentially inexperienced students created the impetus for discovery. We had to begin at the beginning regarding dreams, theater and healing. I had expected to be teaching Theater Department seniors but only some of the students in the class were theater majors; the rest were liberal arts majors fulfilling their humanities requirement. The students ranged from freshman to seniors and came from many different multi-cultural backgrounds. </p>

<p>As Steven Kent does with every class he teaches at the University, we opened each session with a check-in, where we often asked the students to share a dream image. We ended with a check-out that consisted of a question or a statement about dreaming or the content of the class. With this simple device we came to know each other intimately, which is rare in a college classroom. Steven’s theater games further relaxed everyone and released energy and tension, thus reinforcing the possibility of bonding. Dream telling each day involved us deeply in the exploration of our inner lives. </p>

<p>Early on, we made a strategic decision in the interest of efficiency that was critical to the success of the class. We divided the fifteen students into three troupes. Though we heard many of the students’ dreams in the full circle, the troupes worked on their own dreams together when bringing them into form. Because the students now belonged to the dreamers and to the theater troupe, they bonded as a community despite the university setting that generally results in isolation and competitiveness. The students quickly realized they had to be respectful of each other’s inner lives and the necessity of being trustworthy. </p>

<p>Community work happens to be one of Steve’s areas of engagement and expertise, and we were privileged to hear some of his stories about working with gay people in a radical anti-gay state, also with small farmers, with women with AIDs and with other groups in the development of performance pieces. His theater experience with communities, and my experience with individual and community dreaming, together with our life long involvement in the creative process, and more years of teaching between us than either of us wish to tally, were the basis of what we brought to the class. </p>

<p>When considering the actual creation of a performing dream theater group, we both understood that the performance of the dreams would be the ultimate means through which the community could reflect on itself, provide social cohesion and lessen conflict. However, I didn’t realize that the very act of soliciting the dreams in a collective setting would begin the process through which the conflict might resolve. That meant that if the troupe were also willing to present their own dreams in the process of soliciting dreams from the community, the artificial barrier between troupe and community would inevitably dissolve. Finally, enactment could take the community members to yet another level of healing of the original discord. </p>

<p>The most significant understanding came to us when all three troupes independently decided to disregard advice I had given them about enactment. Each troupe met to listen to one another’s dreams and select images/events that reverberated for all of them, which would then be developed theatrically and enacted for the group as a whole. I advised them to avoid “being fair,” rather than including something from everyone’s dreams. I suggested they focus on one or two images/events they found compelling and performable. However, before beginning the work of scripting and developing, each group chose instead to consider each one’s dreams in order to find a common theme. The initial themes were loneliness and separation, explosive emotions, and unacknowledged fear. </p>

<p>At the end of the third week, the three troupes sat in individual story circles, outdoors on the college lawn, imagining darkness and a fire at their center, and spoke of the ways they had experienced these themes in their lives. Though each group exercised confidentiality regarding the details of the stories, when they reported back to the larger group, it was apparent that they had entered the process deeply. They had embraced the experience of loneliness or fear in ‘the other’ as their own, yet recognizing differences as well as commonalities in the origin of such emotions. They had acquired the essential means to understanding and relating back to each other the meaning and implication of their dreams – <strong><em>Empathy</em></strong>.</p>

<p>One student commented that the class had become a group of distinct individuals whom she felt she knew well. Building community had not been one of our stated goals for the class but it became our finest one. </p>

<p>We had found a way, even in a classroom, for the students to experience the exactness and profundity of dream communication. This allowed them to recognize what mattered to them as a community, to refine their intent to communicate this to an audience, to develop language and image to hold their experience, then to embody the experience and finally to perform it for the larger group. The result was that they could bring the dreams back to their original vivid life. Each step in the process eliminated the formal differences between dreamer and actor, between one person and another. Without setting such a heady intention, we were entering into an exquisite balance between our unique experiences, dream language, and the particularity of the dreams themselves, and the trusting and supportive community forming in this setting. </p>

<p>We were working in a multi-cultural setting and outside of conventional psychological dream analysis. The work is predicated on indigenous wisdom dreaming traditions that assume that dreams are a dialogue between the spirit world and the particular tribe, culture or in this case, troupe and university class. This focus allowed for a creative dynamic between particularity and unity and was of great value and solace to the individual class members. No one was left out of the exchange. Everyone was seen as valuable. The class became a sanctuary for the essential beauty and intelligence of each individual within the safety of the circle formed by the participation of each equally. Which is not to say that there were no difficult moments among us. There were. But as far as I know, these issues were acknowledged and resolved. Increasingly, day-by-day, the value of the group, the bond between the students was recognized. </p>

<p>The class process was informed by the presence of Ayelet Berman Cohen, a contemporary dreamer in the old ways. She could not have predicted when she was a prominent photographer in Israel that dreams would become her life. Each night, for twenty years, profound theme-based dreams, as precise and lyrical as any theater or work of literature, have been landing on her, followed by teachings from the ancestors. For many years, she has been dreaming about war, often but not always referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and easily translated into any contemporary struggle between peoples. Many of her war dreams are succeeded by healing dreams, or dreams that are an antidote to war. In one of the sessions, she spoke of how theater allowed the war to be viewed and understood within the very magic of theater itself. The wound and the medicine together in one venue. </p>

<p>She gifted us with a packet of six dreams that gave the students original dream images to work with. Independently, the troupes each chose one or two of the same images to dramatize and explore, so we understood that the conflict between victim and victimizer spoke deeply to them. This initial work with her dreams, which were so fully formed and precise in their theatrical intelligence, prepared the students to look at their own dreams and excerpt the wisdom from them. </p>

<p>Three student dreams at the threshold of the project set the tone for the work to come. One student told a recurring dream that began when she and her family were immigrating to the United States, having already fled civil violence in their native country. In the dream that first came when she was a child, she observed the on-going tension between freedom and imprisonment. The dream had revealed, even to the young child, the fundamental torment that her family and culture were experiencing. </p>

<p>In relating a dream to his father, another student discovered that the family had psychic gifts that had not been spoken about but were passed on through the patriarchal line. </p>

<p>Aware of a repeating image in her recent dreams, a young woman decided to call her indigenous grandmother, only to discover that the dreams were warnings that her proposed generous action would violate her people’s tradition and she would have to wait for the right ritual moment to perform it. </p>

<hr/> 

<p>The final days of <em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> were spent developing the theatrical presentations. Within a remarkably short time, each troupe went from acting out various dream episodes to identifying the common emotional elements, finding dream sequences to hold them, and then discarding these images and events for more vital and appropriate images that communicated the fullness of the conditions and emotions to the observers. Informed by Liz Lerman’s <em>Critical Response Process</em>, the students were then able to revise their pieces once again, bringing each to a new level of reflection and communication, perhaps even more powerful than might arise in a class on improvisation because the images developed from the deep personal dream life of each student. </p>

<p>The students had not known that dreaming had already and would continue to affect and influence their lives. Repeatedly in the check-ins or check-outs, the students expressed their surprise and gratitude for these ways of knowing that they had previously thought entirely unimportant. </p>

<p>Elenna Rubin Goodman, a community builder, had come to the class from Oakland California. The class served her deep desire “ to bring together community, sacred space and the ritual embodiment of dreams/dream theater.” And we were grateful that we could serve both the students and others seeking new ways of serving community that include validating inner life experience. </p>

<p>Three texts informed the class: <em>Black Elk Speaks</em>, by John Neihardt, <em>Healing Dreams: Exploring the Dreams That Can Transform Your Life</em> by Marc Ian Barasch, and <em>The Practice of Dream Healing: Bringing Ancient Greek Mysteries into Modern Medicine</em> by Edward Tick and Stephen Larsen. Each text speaks to the ways dream inform and heal culture as well as bringing wisdom and insight to individuals for their lives. So many of the dreams that the students brought into our circle were unexpectedly revealed to be vehicles for connection, community and cultural restoration. Entering and living within a dreaming culture is an essential antidote to totalitarian and fundamentalist thought. This is iterated by Paco Mitchell in the Winter Solstice 2013 issue of Dream Network Journal, an essay that we shared in class: “…dreams are such bastions of freedom.” </p>

<p>The class was not <em>about</em> creating a dream theater; rather, our intention was to facsimilate the experience of dream theater troupes and dreaming communities. We had started out suggesting that the students imagine that they were a dream troupe or a dreaming community; within days the imagined manifested. We learned swiftly that understanding self through exploring and performing dreams is also a means to establishing communal identity while emphasizing the wild freedom and uniqueness at the core of the creative process. Some of the students may go on to use dreams in their creative work. All of them, I am certain—whether as physicians or private eyes, (two examples of the students’ present vocational goals)—will use dreams as part of their future work in the world. </p>

<p>Considering in retrospect my unheeded advice to the dream troupes and their intelligent insistence on following their own wisdom, I am grateful to have been reminded of the sensitivity necessary in approaching another community — in this case, the community of students. We must always fully respect the other culture and what the community itself knows. Fortunately, I didn’t insist, didn’t impose my own understanding. Fortunately, they chose to discern and honor common themes and experience, and to create communities of respect and relationship among themselves. Fortunately, we all honored the dream.</p>

<p>Each student presented a seven-minute excerpt from the journal they kept for the duration of the class that included dreams, the new understanding of their power and importance, reflections on the class process, and selected passages from the assigned texts. Most spoke their deepest truths to each other, though we had been strangers to each other only a month before. Everyone now understood that he or she has an inner life and all were excited about tending it for the rest of their lives. No one doubted the value, meaning, experience and beauty of dreaming. The possibility of an on-going dream group was gratefully received. </p>

<p>When we were leaving the LaVerne Theater Department, we stopped to converse with the Chairman, David Flaten. Musing together on the original goals of a dream theater to help resolve community conflicts, he paused to wonder, “Should we start a Dream Theater?” Ayelet responded, “Now I am dreaming the end of war.” ∞ </p>

<p><strong>THE FINAL GIFT</strong> of our collective Dream Theatre experience comes from Ayelet Berman Cohen, a dream entitled “Restoration” and which summarizes her dream spirits’ understanding of the process that was destined to engage us all. </p>

<p>(Published with Ayelet’s permission.) </p>

<p>January 23, 2014 </p>

<h3>“Restoration”</h3>

<pre>

A group of students

meet on behalf of their inner lives.

They speak to each other,

and to their astonishment,

discover that the night before,

they all have had the exact same dream.

In their dream

a python lives underneath their house.

There is a group of people shackled to a tree.

And there is another side to the tree.

A woman who lost her mother is there.

And a shark who looks deeply into the eyes of a boy.

There is fear, laughter, movement and confusion,

each image and emotion

matches perfectly in all of their dreams.



The student body has had one common dream.

In their dream they see

a woman carrying a suitcase.

She says it is filled with dreams.

She tells them how the Spirits come to her every night

and dictate to her a dream.

The woman says she has been touched.

When the students wake up

they know that their inner lives

are no longer the same.

Did the Spirits come to them too?

How do the Spirits move?

Who are the Spirits?

Have they been touched?

They wondered.

The silence had been broken.

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6rcodpc-0.jpg" alt="Cloud alarm clock" width="300" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Is a new social awareness about dreams emerging? Not just a few individuals here and there arriving at new heights of dream accomplishment: rather, a growing importance for groups of people who know what it means to safely share their dreams and help one another learn from them. And beyond a few groups, what would it look like for dreams to get real appreciation and respect from the entire society? Can you see it? No? Not even in small ways? </p>

<p>Were this to happen, I think an amazing power would be unleashed that far surpasses what any individual dreamer can generate on their own. For our society, this would be a huge change from where we have been with dreams for some time. And yet I want to hold out that bold vision, as distant as it may seem at present. I want to encourage everyone to spend some time periodically fantasizing about what a difference society's appreciation might make. </p>

<p>One source of inspiration for that vision is looking at other cultures for whom dreams have been in that special spotlight. One can see how many Native American tribes, Australian Aborigines and other indigenous peoples held the dreams in a central place in their collective lives. Some of the strongest inspiration in this vein can be found in fiction, such as the inspiring <em>Kin of Ata</em>, by Dorothy Bryant or Kilton Stewart's writing on the Senoi (<em>The Mystique of Dreams</em> considers this writing to be false as anthropology, yet I continue to find it inspiring and useful as fiction). </p>

<p>These cultures, of course, are very different than our own. All of them lived much closer to nature. Most of them would be called primitive by our culture, usually with a derogatory tone. Yet perhaps we have been too quick to judge. I would at least suggest that we consider what we may have lost along the way, both in the ability to hold the dream in a central place of ho nor and in the ability to live in harmony with nature. Is this really the necessary cost of the civilization that we have developed? What kinds of changes would be needed to regain these abilities? </p>

<p>Perhaps we can look at this particular vision in more depth in future columns, but I would also like to hear about the kind of vision that inspires and moves you. As dreamers, many of you understand the power of a strong vision and the importance of developing depth and clarity. I want to encourage you to be as bold as you can with your dream possibilities visions. In fact, be outrageous! After all, do the dreams themselves hold back? </p>

<p>I realize that many readers may consider this suggestion to be merely an idle exercise in fantasy, or else a certain recipe for frustration. However, I think there are ways to ground our boldest visions in reality and avoid either danger.</p>

<p>My first formula is simple (although it may seem difficult at first): High ideals, low expectations. In other words, develop really outrageous visions of what you would like, but do not expect them to develop soon, easily or maybe not at all. It is a paradox. but if you can hold that direction it can take you a long way. </p>

<p>Here is another formula: Take one of those high ideals and ground it in a simple first step that might move you In that direction. Try it out and see what happens. Another way to think of it is to envision the big picture, the long journey, then break it down into smaller sized pieces. What is the first step on the journey that you might take? If that is still too big, what would a smaller step be? If it comes easily, what would be more of a challenge next? As things move along, does your original vision change? </p>

<p>Final formula: Look at what is already happening that might be moving things in the direction of your vision and work with that. Ride on that energy, as well as encouraging it along. Use your intuition about what might be about to happen and go with the current when it is headed In your direction. Of course you may want to challenge and confront other events that run against the grain of your vision as well. </p>

<p>What does all this mean in concrete specifics? I see a culture that is both hungry for what dreams can offer and at the same time very cut off from them. Where individuals break through the anti-dream biases of our culture to not only connect with their own dreams, but to take leadership in helping others to do so, this is inspiring! My bold vision of a dream-positive culture Is served by those people sharing information and support, and finding ways to encourage new leadership to emerge. </p>

<p>I feel the networking happening in several ways. One is through publications such as this one, other journals and the many books that have come out on dreams. Secondly, I see it at international dream conferences which are now occurring on an annual basis. Both of these are big accomplishments. </p>

<p>Third, there is networking that takes place on a local and regional level. This is most obvious in a few areas where formal networks have developed, such as the Metro DC Dream Community, The San Francisco Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers Support Group and the Montreal Centre for the Study of Dreams. I suspect many other areas have less formal networks going. </p>

<p>These local networking efforts can serve a variety of functions. Simply sharing information and support is perhaps the most common. They can also be a way to reach out to new people and keep dreams in the public eye more effectively. They provide the nucleus for dream related conferences, festivals and other projects. </p>

<p>While it may be very valuable to network with those whose involvement with dreams is similar to yours, there can also be huge benefits in connecting with those who work in very different ways. For instance, a person who gives workshops on the grassroots community level may develop a contact with a teacher in a local college who uses dreams. Or a therapist may find a scientist In the area. While there are big differences here, these people may have a lot to offer one another as allies. And by identifying common interests and ways they can help one another out, as well as appreciating differences, all can benefit. </p>

<p>Local networking should be of particular interest to those who may not always be able to travel to larger international conferences. Further, over time these local/regional networks might be established in many areas, so as one traveled or moved about, they could simply plug in to the local network for sharing and support. While some networks will logically focus on one town, others will do better to start out with a regional focus, perhaps breaking down into smaller areas as they grow. At present my primary interest is to network within the New England region at large. Networks have functioned in New York City and Boston. Can these be revived? </p>

<p>What is the most likely local/regional network in your area, what is already going on. and what is the best next step? I'd love to hear about both successes and failed attempts. as we can learn from both. </p>

<p>Two more quick questions: Has anyone tried using movies and films about dreams to reach out and educate people? If you have, how did it work? If you were to try this, what would you recommend? I would like to pull together a filmography, including instructional films about dreams and dreamwork as well as popular films that have something to offer. In the latter category I think of "The Last Wave," ''The Lathe of Heaven," "Brazil," and even "Nightmare on Elm Street." What comes to your mind? </p>

<p>If you have any dream films to suggest, send me the title, director/author, very brief review and where it can be obtained/cost if that is important. Review copies on VHS are welcome and will be given strong review consideration. If you need your copy back , write with details before sending. </p>

<p>Finally, who can suggest a good source of pens with a light in them? Something that would work well for writing dreams down, perhaps low cost, good quality, that could be made available for dream workshop participants. Getting dreams recorded does not take much, but this can be a good tool and I'd love to know a good source. </p>

<p>Do keep those cards and letters coming. A few have already rolled in and you will start seeing the results in my next column. Let's all join in to make this a real participatory space!</p>

<p></a></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee_of_Sleep">The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use Dreams for Creative Problem Solving &amp; How You Can Too</a> by Deirdre Barrett, 2001, Crown Publishers, 211 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>In this excellent book, Deirdre Barrett details the most important dream-inspired discoveries and creative works of art, music, film, science and medicine that are known. She looks back over the historical record, as well as offering many first-hand interviews with dozens of contemporary people. While simply recounting and verifying these stories alone would make for a great book, the author goes beyond that to discuss many other fascinating topics along the way. </p>

<p>She starts out with the uses of dreams in painting, sculpture, filmmaking, theater and literature. The uses of dreams in these disciplines reproduce dreams most closely, since their mediums are a natural fit with the imagery and story lines in dreams. Many artists have proclaimed dreams as their source of inspiration. For painting, she examines the dream experiences of William Blake and Salvador Dali, including a detailed description of Dali’s “slumber with a key” technique for catching artistic inspiration from hypnagogic dream imagery. She also discusses the process of a dream being turned into art, including dreams that at first simply seem to be nightmarish or problematic, and are only turned into artistic inspiration with time and work. </p>

<p>When examining film, she looks at the work of Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Robert Altman and John Sayles. Along the way, we see how some filmmakers and painters use lucid dreaming to seek out artistic inspiration, and ponder how the proliferation of movies may be altering the nature of dreaming. </p>

<p>In examining dream inspiration in literature, the book looks at Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly, Robert Louis Stevenson, Stephen King and many others. She quotes extensively from Naomi Epel’s excellent book, Writers Dreaming. She also gets her book title from the John Steinbeck quote, “It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.” Using the metaphor of the committee of sleep for dreams is powerful, but I suspect some will find it overdone and at times annoying. </p>

<p>In the chapter on dream inspiration in music, we learn how the tune for Paul McCartney’s song Yesterday arrived in a dream. At first Paul thought he must have heard it from someone else, and since it arrived in a dream, it took some time to claim it as his own. And originally, it had no words, so he played with it under the name of “Scrambled Eggs.” The final version became the inspiration for the string sound of the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album, and has been played six million times on American radio, more than any other song. </p>

<p>Billy Joel states that “all the music I have composed has come from a dream” and Joseph Shabalala, founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo reports that he has dreamed music every single night of his life, always sung by a choir of children. This sparks discussion about the wide range of musicians who have gotten inspiration from dreams, some frequently, others as rare occurrences, some from hearing the music and others who were inspired by a visual dream. </p>

<p>In her sections of scientific discoveries and inventions, we look at the famous discovery of the molecular structure of Benzene, and the invention of the sewing machine, along with many others. Along the way, the author examines some “urban legends” of discoveries made in dreams which further investigation reveals were not actually dream inspired. These include the discovery of the structure of DNA or the structure of the Atom. Clearly, these faulty stories give ammunition to those who dismiss altogether the idea of dream creativity. But as she shows in this book, most of the classic stories do check out. </p>

<p>These chapters also include a good guide to ways that people can incubate a dream, focusing on a particular problem or issue one would like their dreams to address. She examines a wide range of ways that dreams have inspired discoveries and breakthroughs, even in a scientific culture where dream inspiration is not always highly thought of. </p>

<p>In her chapter on dreams &amp; the body, she shows how dreams can offer medical diagnosis and treatment that was not consciously known, often in a symbolic form. Although not much research has been done in this area, she reports on what has been done. Further, she shows how many athletes have been able to practice and enhance their performance in dreams. A final chapter on Dreams in nonwestern cultures examines how an entire written alphabet was inspired by a dream and adopted in the African country of Liberia, when they had only used an oral tradition prior to that time. She also shows the part that Gandhi’s dreams of resistance played in the transformation of India into an independent state. Examples such as these and many others lead to discussion of cultures who honor dreams and listen to them more closely than our own. What might our culture learn from them? </p>

<p>In our culture, dreams are seen as mostly personal and psychological, best viewed in therapy, as mediated by a professional therapist, if they are given any attention at all. As the author points out, many other books deal with the psychological aspects of dreams. This book will go a long way in giving dreams respectability outside of that narrow box. The discussion of how these dreams have been translated into creative expressions and Nobel-prize winning discoveries can be inspiring. The discussion of how to listen to dreams, how to increase lucid dreaming or incubate a dream, may encourage many readers to adopt these practices. </p>

<p>In the end, the author concludes that dreams are neither consistently wise or consistently useless, but that dreaming is a different mode of thought, and its true power may lie in how dream inspiration can compliment waking thought. Further, she points out that we live in a dream-neglecting culture and may have much to learn by listening to those from dream-honoring cultures. This is an important book which I hope will be read by many.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Henry Reed</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> How did you become interested in dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> There were two things. One, as a psychology graduate student at UCLA in the '60s I was interested in multiple personalities, amnesia and fugue states. I was interested in how we knew who we are. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What's a "fugue state?" </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> It's like a multiple personality, but one shot at a time. A person becomes amnesiac of who they are, becomes someone else. Then one day they wake up and wonder what they've been doing. You might say it's like prolonged sleepwalking, except it could go on for months or years. My advisor told me I wasn't going to run across too many multiple personalities, I wasn't going to run into amnesia very often and fugue states were rare; how was I going to make a living in this publish-or-perish world? I should find something that happened more often. Then I realized we were amnesiac for our dreams. We'd have these experiences while we slept and in the morning we were none the wiser. The human potential movement was starting about then so it was easy to say, "Learn to remember your dreams, learn how to tap into potential." I started with how to remember dreams. Then it dawned on me that I didn't remember mine.</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, so you really thought there was a correlation between being a researcher and being a dreamer? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> Well, there was for me. Before I started any experiments I started to record my dreams. I worked on that for more than six months. Based on what I'd learned, I taught a course in dreams. We kept records of recall and tried experiments in recall. That was my first project. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> You said there were two factors that got you interested in dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> I had a friend who kept telling me about these incredible dreams he was having. They were often psychic. I never saw any reference in psychology to dreams except in terms of interpretation or analysis. My friend was inspiring me to look beyond them. While he was looking for a studio, he dreamt of one. Then he drove around town to try and find the studio. He found it. That incident struck a chord, as if dreams were somehow an internal gyroscope, an internal advisor. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I know you have a close relationship with A.R.E. (the Edgar Cayce organization). Was that always your metaphysical focus? <strong>Henry:</strong> At one time my friend had an interest in Cayce. It seemed to me that Cayce went into a fugue state in which he was wise; then he'd wake and be an ordinary guy. I took more of an interest in his process than his philosophy. </p>

<p>For my dissertation my advisor thought it would be good if I ran an experiment myself. The female research assistant who had been running them said something like, "I don't know why you men do these kinds of experiments. You already know what you want, what you're trying to get, so we're just going through the rote." I sat there through the experiment and kind of felt the same way. </p>

<p>I had received a lot of flack at the university about my ideas of full disclosure to the subjects about the hypotheses, that there should be dialogue between everybody, a cooperative venture. This was the ideal of humanistic research espoused by Sydney Gerard who wrote <em>The Transparent Self</em>. </p>

<p>I got pulled into the A.R.E. primarily because they were trying to figure out a way to do research that was similar to the way I had been thinking: to invite the subjects in as co-learners with the experimenter. That model didn't exist anywhere else. </p>

<p>Cayce had said that the ideals and purposes of the researcher had a lot more to do with what would be discovered than the nature of the experiment. When he'd get approached to do telepathy tests, he'd respond that you wouldn't learn much about telepathy if you focused on telepathy per se, because it tended to create a certain kind of self-consciousness in the person: am I being telepathic or am I not? He said that it would be better to create situations in which people could be helpful to one another and have no other way of doing it than through telepathy; to focus on the nature of the help that would be received or given. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Is your work inspired by Native American tradition or Shamanism? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> I never used the word "Shamanism." Because of the impact dreams were having on me, I followed a Shamanic pattern unknowingly. I was always interested in what today we would call "channeling:" bringing something from one realm into another, creating a complete cycle. I was really interested in some other dimension of life and dreams were the doorway. </p>

<p>My first recorded dream addressed the fact that I was alcoholic. It was explained to me that I was acting out my own healing by doing dream incubation work. </p>

<p>I felt dreams were part of a complete feedback loop, receiving inspiration from whatever source, enacting the inspiration and giving it back to the source, so that more would come. Dreams are a source and have to be fed, with some activity or by honoring them. I even did a study whereby if a person did something on the basis of a dream, they were more likely to have a dream, and have a dream that was understandable. It's like two in a conversation: if you're talking to somebody and they're deadpan, you lose interest. But if they're animated, they talk back, get excited. </p>

<p>I started drawing my dreams. Dream shields came out of a dream related to the Dream Helper Ceremony. For Dream Shields you take symbols from many dreams and put them together to represent the whole of you. It was as if each dream were a snapshot in a family photo album. You could look at each picture and ask, "Who is this person?" The composite would represent what you considered to be your path, your style or your identity. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What kind of dreamwork do you do? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> When I work with people in counseling, dreams are never a priority for me, it's always the person. Most of the dreamwork that I have done has been in workshop settings, educational settings. Usually there's some challenge that I'm responding to. </p>

<p>One of the challenges was to find the dreamwork equivalent of "you only own what you can give away". I'd have people tune in on a positive quality or dream image that seemed to represent that quality and have them work until they made sounds, improvised singing, movement and dance. They'd perform the "song and dance" of their dream symbol as a give-away, like they were emitting energy. Then I'd have people become qualities that were weak, hurting, in some kind of need. We did a lot of plays and ceremonies of blessing one another. People would enact their positive symbols with the idea that they would bring them more to life. Looking back now, this was another way I was trying to channel energy into everyday life. </p>

<p>When I was first involved in writing, another challenge was, could I teach a person how to interpret their dreams though the printed word, where I wasn't going to be there physically? I used journal writing as a method. </p>

<p>Most of my work has been dream informed: on the basis of a dream I'd get the idea to do this experiment or that experiment. So while I was working on developing a journal, I said to the A.R.E. people, you may have a dream about this experiment we're doing, and if you do, send it in. A lot of them did and a couple of them dreamt of a journal. They also showed a lot of excitement about dreamwork they could do at home and they wanted to know about other people's experiences. So the beginnings of <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> was feeding them back a report. </p>

<p>The work with shoe dreams is based on what I learned when I was publishing Sundance: You can get a lot of people involved helping with a project if you only keep feeding them back what they send you. Usually the communication's just one way, but if you feed it back, you incorporate their dreams; they feel a part of it and it grows. We couldn't live in a dream community, but through the vehicle of a journal we could have a community where we could learn about how to work with dreams, the implications.</p>

<p>I used the idea with subscriptions. I had people put their subscription form under their pillows. It seemed like a dumb idea. It shouldn't even be possible because we dream about things we care about. It takes a lot of effort to direct your dreams, and this was towards an abstraction. Yet people dreamt about the journal and got real excited about it. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your goals now? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> The major goal I've always had is for people to realize how creative and full of spirit they are, if they would just flow.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104132.Dreaming_While_Awake">Dreaming While Awake: Techniques For 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming</a> by Arnold Mindell, 2000, Hampton Roads Publishing Company, 288 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dreaming is the mystical source of reality. This book is devoted to perceiving, living and orienting you to the power of Dreaming. My goal is not to notice the Dreaming only occasionally, but to develop a constant awareness of Dreaming with the new method I call 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have long known that Arnold Mindell has some unique and very important insights into dreams, having noticed his books on the Dreambody approach, synthesizing dreams with bodywork. As a graduate of MIT and the Jung Institute in Switzerland, Mindell founded a new school of therapy called Process Oriented Psychology. But this book is a true groundbreaker, a shamanic surprise, surpassing all expectations. </p>

<p>This book is inspired by the concept of the Dreaming, as it is understood by Australian Aborigines. Mindell begins by examining Aboriginal Dreaming and its connections with quantum physics, psychology, and Buddhism. For the Aboriginal elders, the Dreaming is the basis of all life, and is clearly larger than what we think is going on in rapid eye movement sleep. Mindell does a great job of explaining this view to western readers, using the metaphor of the light and dark sides of the moon. While most of us go through life focused only on the bright side of the moon, we need to have an understanding of the dark side, the Dreaming reality, in order to have a wholistic grasp of deeper reality. Further, Mindell states, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...it seems to me that ignoring the Dreaming is an undiagnosed global epidemic. People everywhere suffer from a chronic form of mild depression because they are taught to focus on everyday reality and forget about the Dreaming background."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the Aboriginal peoples have long noted this tendency we have to "ignore the Dreaming" in statements such as "White man got no Dreaming, him go 'nother way. White man, him go different." Mindell, on the other hand, shows in this book that we each can develop an awareness of the Dreaming. In fact, for many he would maintain it is essential for a full and complete life. "Without Dreaming, you are living only half your life and seeing only half the world." Much of this book discusses what is would mean to develop that awareness, with many specific exercises to enable the reader develop that ability. </p>

<p>In the effort to expand our awareness of the Dreaming, Mindell also expands the meaning of "lucid dreaming." This expanded definition has many implications for anyone exploring dreams. He states, "Because you are Dreaming all day long, I wish to expand the idea of lucid dreaming to mean being awake during Dreaming not only at night but also during the day." He traces the history of the western concept of lucid dreaming through Rudolf Steiner, Alan Worsley, Stephen La Berge and Jane Gackenback, and shows how that understanding is too limited and fragmented for his purposes. He then shows how his work, along with insights from Australian Aborigines and Eastern perspectives, such as that of the Dalai Lama, point of a larger, deeper wholistic definition of lucid dreaming. Thus he urges the reader to develop an awareness he calls 24-hour Lucid Dreaming.</p>

<p>Mindell draws in a neat little diagram where The Dreaming is the basis of life, the root of it all. Arising from that level, we come to Dreamland, the place where dreams occur. And then, arising from that, we come to consensus reality, the place where you and I live our everyday lives. He points out that most of the study of dreamwork focuses on the relation between what goes on in Dreamland and daily consensus reality. In this book, we focus our attention on lucidly noticing experiences occurring between Dreamtime and Dreamland. This is subtle work, often examining vague feelings and intuitions that can barely be verbalized. Mindell does a good job of not only verbalizing some of these usually vague and invisible parts of reality, but also showing how such work can have profound ramifications in our daily lives.</p>

<p>The bulk of this book goes into specifics about how one might develop such a deeper awareness of the Dreaming in various areas of our lives. Mindell examines addictions &amp; relationships, time travel, lucid healing &amp; preventive medicine, and Dreaming as world work. Each of these discussions include innovative exercises, instructive stories and diagrams and ideas for further exploration. If there is a downside to this book, it may be that the reader is introduced to so many possibilities that one becomes disillusioned or frustrated. There is no way that any author can cover each area approached here comprehensively. </p>

<p>I recommend this book very highly for the inspiring perspective and wealth of insights, as well as specific exercises geared to developing a deeper awareness of the Dreaming. I suspect that readers will be able to take the ideas in this book in many different directions. As Mindell states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"My goal is to make the Dreaming roots of reality so accessible, so visceral, that your conscious mind will give you back your right to dream."</em></p>

    ns1:description """<p>It is commonplace today to hear it said that we can solicit guidance from our dreams - that we can pose questions or problems to our dreams and receive answers or solutions. No doubt many subscribers to DNB have had experiences that lend support to this notion. On the other hand, scientific research on dreams has hardly demonstrated that dreams have any meaning worth interpreting, much less that they may be solicited as oracles. What a gap in world views! </p>

<p>It could be useful to bring scientific inquiry as a tool to help would-be dream solicitors evaluate and perfect their guidance systems. For example, Carl Jung, who paid tribute to the tremendous wisdom expressed in dreams, nevertheless, cautioned that apparent examples of controlling dream content were too often self-deceptive perceptions of the dream's truly autonomous intent. An attitude of scientific research may help us avoid self-deception, but that research approach must be compatible with our objectives, less it become irrelevant. </p>

<p>Research related to obtaining guidance from dreams has generally taken one of two forms. The first involves attempting to control dream content, where a person is given some specific theme to try to dream about ("You will dream about trees!"). The second involves attempting to solve puzzles in dreams ("Complete this series: OTTFFS!"). The simplifications these types of experiments introduce may well eliminate the ingredients necessary to effectively persuade the intentions of the dreams. Themes that are easy to define and identify are necessary in experiments, yet it it probably much more difficult to dream about what you are instructed to than to dream about what you really care to. Having a known answer to check against the dream's answer makes experimental evaluation easier, but what is the point of spending precious dream time on puzzles? </p>

<p>Several years ago, the A.R.E. commissioned me to create an experimental situation to investigate Edgar Cayce's claim that it is possible to solicit guidance from dreams. For this project, I deviated from the usual types of experiments in that I asked the dreamers to define for themselves the problem theme to dream about, problems for which no known answers already existed. This project was carried out through the mail, and required that I develop in writing a detailed outline of the step-by-step procedures the dreamers were to follow at home in seeking guidance from their dreams. The result was a workbook that emphasized journal writing as the main medium of focussing the person's efforts and of working with dream interpretation. The workbook specified a period of 28 days of working on the problem at hand, going through weekly cycles of problem definition, writing petitions for dream guidance, dream interpretation, and formulating trial solutions for testing and evaluation. The workbook thus required a level of commitment on the dreamer's part to solving the chosen problem that Cayce had said would be necessary to obtain valid guidance from dreams. </p>

<p>The results of this project, conducted with over 500 people, were very encouraging. Dream recall, rather than the quality of the "solutions" obtained, was what was measured numerically, so there was no "hard data" to evaluate the dream guidance. Yet the self-reports prepared by the participants contained many convincing stories of problem resolution. Over the years since, in fact, I received so many requests for additional copies of that workbook that I finally revised the workbook, now titled, DREAM REALIZATIONS, for sale to the general public as a creative problem-solving tool. </p>

<p>The A.R.E. then asked me to design another research project, this time concerning the evaluation of psychic readings. The format was to follow a suggestion made by Cayce, that if you were going to consult a psychic concerning a troubling question, then you should consult at least two, and that you should also meditate, consult your dreams and alternative sources of guidance, and then correlate the results. There were 124 participants in the project. Each one submitted four personal questions that they wanted answered. Their questions were then given to a group of psychics selected by the A.R.E. on the basis of their reputation and on the results of a sample test reading. Each participant's set of questions was answered by two psychics identified only by number. Their questions were also addressed through other sources of guidance: an astrology reading was provided, a numerology reading, a counseling session, and several hours of group discussion~ personality inventories were administered at the beginning of the session and results explained and discussed with the participants. In addition, each participant was given an opportunity to solicit dream guidance for one of their questions, using a condensed, ''one-night stand" version of my revised DREAM REALIZATIONS workbook. The participant's job was ·to then complete a workbook requiring a structured and concrete evaluation of the information provided by the two psychics and to compare their answers with the information obtained from the other sources. They also had to perform a series of numerical ratings concerning these comparisons. </p>

<p>The amount of information generated for statistical analysis was substantial, and will take another year to evaluate. However, one little piece of that data speaks to our question about soliciting guidance from dreams. In one of the rating tasks, participants were asked to make a judgment concerning the relative help they had received from the various sources of guidance. They were to distribute 100 "tokens" to these various sources of guidance according to how much help on their questions they felt that source had provided. We were expecting that, overall, the psychics would receive most of the "credit," and generally speaking, that is what happened. The only other source of guidance that received nearly as high a rating was the dream guidance. Of the 124 participants, only 60 of them remembered their dreams, and of these, 50 felt they were able to compare their dream information with their psychic readings. Of these 50 persons, 30 felt that the psychic readings were superior to their dream guidance. However, the other 20 participants felt that their own dream guidance was as good or better than either one or both of their psychic readings. That is, for every three people who felt that their psychic readings were the most helpful, there were two people who felt that their experience with "Dream Realization" was the most helpful in answering their question. We didn't expect dreams to "win", but we were surprised that they scored so well against the psychic readings. Remember, this finding is a preliminary result. As we analyze the data in more detail, we will be able to learn, for example, whether the relative effectiveness of dream guidance compared to psychic guidance varies as a function of the type of question being asked. </p>

<p>This project has indirectly suggested an intriguing, new way to research the question of whether dreams can be solicited for guidance. Suppose you have a question or problem you can't resolve - where are you going to get the best information: from your dreams? from a book? from a counselor? from a psychic? If dreams prove to be a good source <em>relatively</em> speaking, then even if it is still difficult to prove the dream's <em>absolute</em> value, we'll know nevertheless that we're onto something. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I open my closet and a torrent of shoes pour out upon the floor."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream initiated a research project on the meaning of shoes in dreams. When I placed a call for dreams of shoes in <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, 172 dreams were submitted. What type of footprints do shoes leave in dreams?</p>

<p>The most frequent pattern was a dreamer noting shoes having special features. Dreamers found shoes made of volcanic ash, for example, or shoes made from living, walking turtles, shoes with wings, and high-heeled tennis shoes. </p>

<p>The second most frequent pattern was the theme of being concerned about the appropriateness of the shoes being worn. One dreamer tried to walk through snow in high heels. Ronald Reagan sold another dreamer a pair of shoes the dreamer wasn't sure she really wanted. One dreamer complained that the shoes didn't fit appropriately, they were too tight. Another dreamer wore tennis shoes to a fancy ball. </p>

<p>The third most frequent theme was that of losing one's shoes. One dreamer left a party and later discovered that she had left her shoes behind. Someone took another dreamer's shoes. One dreamer was standing in line at a complaint department to describe shoes that had been lost. Another dreamer was riding on a horse when his shoes fell off. </p>

<p>There were many other frequent patterns. Many dreams expressed the theme of an abundance of shoes, such as the dream that. initiated this project. The theme of polishing or repairing shoes was also common. Many dreams involved shopping for shoes. Discovering old shoes was another favorite. </p>

<p>Shoe stories in dreams seem to mirror the shoe situations encountered in life. Shoes with special features seem to be a notable exception. </p>

<p>What do shoes mean to the dreamer? Respondents offered such explanations as understanding, role, adaptation and persona. More generally, we might suggest that shoes represent cognitive schemes, or mental abstractions, used as structures to contain and give shape to experience. They are used as an adaptive tool to help navigate through life situations. Carl Jung once remarked, "The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits in all cases." </p>

<p>Many shoe dreams reflected a concern for individuality as well as appropriateness. In one dream, for example, the dreamer lamented that all the shoes in the store seemed mass produced and none fit her unique orientation. One dreamer offered this observation, which can be taken both literally and metaphorically: "It's hard to find a good looking pair of shoes that fit comfortably." </p>

<p>Given this concern for functional and appropriate shoes that match the dreamer's individuality, it is surprising that in none of the dreams was there ever mention of making one's own shoes or having custom made shoes . Here is an aspect of shoes from real life that is missing in dreams. What can explain this discrepancy? Perhaps it is because the types of understanding symbolized by shoes aren't the sort we consciously create, but come from the subconscious mind. For example, in fairy tales, it is often the brownies that make shoes for a person while that person sleeps. </p>

<p>One final note: Three dreamers noted that their shoe dreams came at a time of transition. Perhaps when we need to pay attention to our style of adaptation, we think of our shoes.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Let me begin by explaining that I am one of those people who firmly believes that death is not the end, but a passage to and a beginning of life in another dimension. I am convinced that all living beings have a soul that will live on after death and from this non-material space can send messages to the people left behind. </p>

<p>These communications can be transmitted in a variety of ways. For example, the one from my dad, who—on his deathbed—promised me he would let me know if there was life after death by coming back and stirring up my cats. And—oh my!—how they screeched six weeks after he died, running down the stairs with their coats so puffed out they looked about twice their normal size. I thought: ‘Thank you dad, point taken’, after which the cats (and their coats) went back to normal and a bit of my feelings of loss were healed. But that was real-life, not a dream. </p>

<p>In 1992, a friend died suddenly in a car-crash abroad. I felt guilty about his death because before leaving he had consulted me on whether or not he should take up a foreign job offer. He was in two minds about the decision. On one hand, he wanted to go; the job-market in his line of work was really bad at that time and this would be an opportunity for him to get a well-paid position. On the other hand, he felt obliged to stay and look after his mother; he was an only child and his father had passed just a couple of months earlier. I had told him that he should, of course, make up his own mind, but that in my opinion, accepting the job might be a boon for both his career and personal growth. So he decided to take the job, left the country, and was killed in the car-crash only a few months later. </p>

<p>For several reasons I didn’t attend his funeral, although I thought about him a lot throughout the day. I remember feeling very sad for his mother, who’d lost both her husband and her son within a couple of months of one another and thinking how unfair life can seem to be. That night I dreamt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>B arrives at my house, driving a bright red convertible. He’s in a great mood, says he’s come to pick me up, wanting to spend the day with me. I look at him, asking him: “You’re dead. How can you be here when you’re dead?” He answers: “But I’m not. I’m not dead. There was a mistake made with my date of birth. Look.” He shows me his passport and indeed there is an incorrect birth-date in it. So I get into the car and we drive around, having a great time together.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream helped me come to terms with my feelings of guilt about his death, and experience all the stages of mourning.</p>

<p>Although over time this existence-after-death idea became a firm conviction of mine, I seemed to be unable to tap into it when in 2012 someone very dear to me died unexpectedly—at quite a young age—of a previously undiagnosed cardiac disorder. </p>

<p>Looking at his seemingly unimpaired body, I went into a state of shock, being unable to cry or otherwise express my feelings. I spent three days numbly moving around, with this gaping hole in the middle of me. Clinging to every tiny shred of everyday life, I attempted to get the chores done, trying to stay on the sane side of life, while being in full shut-down mode, both emotionally and brain-wise. </p>

<p>While in this state, I had the following dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m standing outside my house and look up. It is sunny, the sky is a clear blue with white clouds. I notice a sheet of white Styrofoam that moves high up on the wind. The sheet floats and tumbles, rises, drops down and tumbles again. I keep looking at the movements for a long time, getting a feeling of enormous freedom and utter joy while doing so.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream left me with a sense of freedom, the sensation and joy of being able to move on the wind weightlessly, not being encumbered by a body or any other type of mass. While contemplating the dream, I interpreted it as seeing a soul going up to heaven, experiencing—and in this case sharing—the weightlessness, carefreeness and a sense of bliss; the dead person telling me it was okay, he was okay, he was feeling exuberant.</p>

<p>After this dream, I came out of shut-down, was able to cry, to feel the sadness of losing someone precious, and at the same time, realizing life doesn’t stop at death and might even be quite enjoyable once we arrive on the other side. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this was a very young person dying unexpectedly. There wasn’t only sadness; of course, there was anger as well. The next night I dreamt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m having a terrific row with three very haughty ladies. They have their hair piled up high on their heads and wear expensive dresses and jewelry. I find them pompous.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>I feel they’ve done me a great injustice and want them to understand that. I am so angry I could ram their heads through the wall. I shout at them at the top of my voice, but they don’t react. I feel utterly frustrated about that. I then realize that what I’m doing is completely useless, they don’t show any reaction whatsoever.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took me a while to realize that in this dream I was spending a hell of a lot of energy shouting at the Fates. Who, of course, never reacted, precisely because they were the Fates. So, I decided I’d better look up and re-read the text in Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (King James’ version), which in all its wisdom did help me to make the loss more bearable. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what better bearer of peace than a message from beyond the veil, assuring us that this life is not all there is and there will be a time to begin anew in another dimension of our everlasting existence? ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Bring to mind how different life seemed when you were younger? Your perspective on the world, your beliefs about What you could accomplish, your sense of what was important may have all transformed as you have developed. Reflection on these changes brings into focus the aspect of mental life that has been termed <em>personal mythology</em>. This concept is useful for assisting individuals in keeping their consciousness attuned to the unending demands made upon it by a rapidly changing world and by the ongoing psychological dilemmas life presents. </p>

<p>Personal myths are complex internal structures that determine how we experience the world. A personal mythology is an individual's ever-changing system of complimentary and conflicting personal myths, and it provides the wider context which shapes perceptions, thoughts, and ultimately actions. The models we carry in our heads influence every possibility we see and every choice we make, and these internalized models are products of our personal mythology. They are more than self concept, more than scripts, and more than value systems, dynamically addressing each of these fundamental questions of identity: "Who am I" (self-concept); "Where am I going?" (scripting); and "Why?" (beliefs and values). They govern our perceptions, our cognitions, and thus our behavior. </p>

<p>Mythology has been seen as a venerable source of psychological guidance in the complex choices faced by human beings across cultures and throughout time. The history of this ancient concept is said to provide a record of the development of human consciousness. Mythology stands on the recognition that our notions about the world are, in fact, <strong>not</strong> fact, but an interplay of perceptions and culturally influenced internal models for interpreting those perceptions. A myth is not a falsehood but a way of interpreting reality that may ultimately be judged as being functional or dysfunctional for an individual's wholesome development at a particular point in time. The logic found in mythologies throughout cultures throughout time is perhaps the closest reflection in existence of the complex workings of the human mind. Revitalizing the deep significance of this powerful, ancient concept is particularly appropriate at this point in history because it enhances the vitality of our psychological explanations while reflecting the hypothetical nature inherent in any construct of reality. </p>

<p>What is a personal myth? Is it a story? Is it a personal lifestyle? Is it an attitude? It is not identical to any of these, yet it is at the core of each of them. Each is a reflection of an underlying personal myth. A personal myth is a schema, a template, a colored lens through which we see our world and our role in it, a cookie-cutter through which we stamp out our own version of reality from the undifferentiated cosmic dough. </p>

<p>The most appropriate scientific model for understanding personal myths comes from the field of cognitive psychology which provides the concept of the cognitive structure. Cognitive structures are internalized schemata for understanding or for performing activities. Personal myths are those cognitive structures that serve the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing for an individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those functions for a society. Personal mythology provides a context which, while operating largely outside our conscious awareness, produces the unfolding drama or our mental lives. </p>

<p>See if you can identify the conflicting personal myths that are dominating the inner life of the woman described in the following scenario. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Betty is a 34-year-old mother of two small children. Her days are filled with the chores of being good mother, housewife, and citizen. Her friends view her clan as a model family. While Betty appears happy, inner turmoil has been developing. It seemed to start with a dream: There is a bird in a nest, resting content, feeding its beautiful babies, when a strong wind comes up and, after great struggle, blows the bird away into a terrifying unknown. Very upset by this dream, Betty starts having trouble sleeping. She becomes irritable. She beings to feel constantly troubled, and she finds that her temper is growing shorter and shorter with her children and her husband. The harder she tries to keep things smooth, the more depressed she gets, until she has almost no energy. She describes these concerns to her physician who suggests she make a better adjustment to the demands of her role and gives her antidepressant medication. The drugs do give her more energy and in a subsequent visit he suggests she get out of the house and become more active in the community. She is elected President of the PTA and joins two committees in her church. At times she feels a chronic pain in the back of her neck. She notices that this pain decreases when she yells at her kids, but then she feels guilty and has stomach discomfort. She starts having fantasies about going on archeological digs and begins to read avidly about travel. These fantasies trouble her and she takes on greater responsibilities with the PTA and her church until she has virtually no time for herself. Her temper grows shorter, she starts having a recurrent dream about suffocating, and she begins to wonder if she is having a nervous breakdown. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, Betty's conflicting mythologies found expression in her dreams, fantasies, thought content, emotional reactions, behaviours, and even somatic changes. We can see in Betty's case how, when a prevailing myth becomes dysfunctional or otherwise outdated, the psyche may generate a new myth, and each may compete for dominance of the individual's perceptions, thoughts, and behaviors. Betty's ordeal was aggravated substantially by her suppression of the emerging myth from her conscious awareness. Had she attended to the first dream with a valid guiding perspective on the development of her inner life - or to any of a host of other signals - she could have worKed with the conflict in a much more direct, effective, and less disruptive manner. </p>

<p>Understanding the nature of personal mythology is a way of gaining such a perspective on the development of your inner life. Because personal myths are a class of cognitive structure, they function according to lawful patterns of development which have been scientifically described and can be deliberately influenced by the individual. As we mature, dysfunctional myths become increasingly detrimental, and prevailing myths which at one time provided beneficial guidance may also become outdated for our optimum development. At these times, the psyche does generate a counter-mythology based on life experiences that contradict the old myth, the ongoing processing of input from the wider culture, and transcendent experiences that may be revealed in dreams, inspirations, or peak moments. The emerging myth organizes perceptions and thoughts in a different way than the prevailing myth, and a conflict may be set into motion deep within the psyche. The more we are able to maintain an awareness of the dynamics of this conflict, the more we are able to maintain a harmony with the natural process by which our consciousness evolves. Skills in worKing with our own dreams, imagery, mental conflicts, and behavioral contradictions provide us with an opportunity for a productive resolution of the competing mythologies, finally anchoring into our lifestyles a new myth that integrates the most functional aspects of the prevailing myth with the most beneficial from the counter-myth. </p>

<p>These skills can be systematized and taught to the public based on current knowledge from the field of cognitive psychology placed within a broader mythological perspective. It is at the points of change or dysfunction that it is most useful to focus on the underlying mythology and related conflicts that may be in progress. From each individual a mythology can be mined that is a rich in symbolic content as the myths of cultures - indeed the myths of cultures originate in the interplay of the psyches of that culture's members and its history - and by understanding the dynamics of their own personal myths individuals are able to take an increasingly participatory role in shaping their own destinies. Because of the inextricable relationship between personal and cultural mythology, such understanding also provides citizens with sKills for examining, relating to, and influencing the ongoing development of the myths of their culture. </p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>

<p><em>Treating myth-making as the vehicle through which consciousness is given form, this paper traces historical evidence indicating that mythology, consciousness, and culture have evolved in concert. No longer are myths conveyed by a single storyteller around a campfire. Each person in ancient times was wedded to the mythology of the tribe, but modern cultures do not have a single unifying mythology. Today, numerous competing myths and fragments of myths vie for people's attention and allegiance. Our senses are bombarded by diverse mythic images that are simultaneously flashed around the world. These developments allow and, in fact, force people to think for themselves in ways that were unimaginable in the past. Mythmaking, and the spiritual concerns that have always been the province of mythology, have increasingly become the responsibility of the individual. Developments leading to this "personalizing" of mythology, and their implications, are discussed.</em></p>

<h2>PART ONE</h2>

<p>Piaget identified three types of knowledge: 1) innate knowledge, such as drives and instincts, 2) knowledge of the physical world, based on sensory perception and 3) cognitive structures that are a product of reflective abstraction on the other two. The view that human behavior and experiences are mediated by cognitive structures- that people's responses are reactions not to stimuli but to their interpretation of stimuli - has become a pivotal concept in contemporary psychological thought. In a series of works, my colleagues and I have suggested that understanding consciousness in terms of the individual's evolving personal mythology augments and refines this cognitive approach by conceptually embracing the intuitive realm and the spiritual impulse in conceiving the individual's assumptive world.</p>

<h2>MYTHOLOGY AS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY</h2>

<p>The anthropologist Eugene d'Aquili coined the term "cognitive imperative" to describe the human compulsion to order reality in a meaningful manner. According to d'Aquili, this universal, biologically-rooted human drive to organize unexplained external stimuli into a meaningful form is a critical element of humanity's evolutionary advantage over other creatures, and it was "the last development required for the emergence of culture". By drawing upon mythology to understand the fulfilment of the cognitive imperative, we break out of the conceptually linear shackles of the cognitive structure and enter the conceptually expansive world that has always been the domain of mythology. </p>

<p>Myths have been described as large controlling images that organize experience and direct action (Schorer 1960). In the sense we are using the terms, myths are not falsehoods. Nor are they legends, stories, attitudes, or beliefs, but each of these may reflect deeper mythic processes. Nor are myths only the product of archaic thought of primitive peoples. As Joseph Campbell put it, "The latest incarnation of Oedipus, the continued romance of Beauty and the Beast, stand this afternoon on the corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change". According to Marian, it "is not that modern man has become any less mythic, but that he has unconsciously lived the myths of logic and science. These myths unduly restrict the deepening of human consciousness and help to foster the feelings of alienation and 'exile' so common in modern times".</p>

<p>Myth-making, at both the individual and the collective level, is the primary though often unperceived psychological mechanism by which human beings order reality and navigate their way through life. As the human species evolved, mythological thinking - the ability to symbolically address large questions- replaced genetic mutation as the primary vehicle by which individual consciousness and societal innovations were carried forward. Unlike terms such as scripts, beliefs, or cognitive structures, myth is able to embrace the intuitive and spiritual dimensions of human consciousness that elude many of the constructs psychologists have used to describe the core components of experience. </p>

<p>Cognitive structures assume mythic proportions as they begin to address the issues identified by Joseph Campbell as the primary domains in which mythic thought functions: 1) the need to comprehend one's world in a meaningful way, 2) the search for a marked pathway through the succeeding epochs of human life, 3) the urgency to establish secure and fulfilling relationships within a community, and 4) the longing to know one's part in the vast wonder and mystery of the cosmos. Personal myths explain the world, guide individual development, provide social direction, and address spiritual longings in a manner analogous to the way cultural myths carry out these functions for entire societies. Personal myths do for an individual what cultural myths do for a community. </p>

<p>Personal myths are the product of four interacting sources. The most obvious are biology (the capacities for symbolism and narrative are rooted in the structure of the brain, information and attitudes are neurochemically coded, temperament and hormones influence belief systems, etc.), culture (the individual's mythology is, to an extent, the culture's mythology in microcosm), and personal history (every emotionally significant event leaves a mark on one's developing mythology). A fourth source is rooted in transcendent experiences - those episodes, insights, dreams and visions that have a numinous quality, expand a person's perspective, and inspire behavior. Transcendent experiences vary in their strength and significance. Their most profound form is in the full-blown mystical or religious experience. William James reported that "mystical states of a well-pronounced and emphatic sort are usually authoritative over those who have them... Mystical experiences are as direct perceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations ever were for us". For Philip Wheelwright, "the very essence of myth" is "that haunting awareness of transcendental forces peering through the cracks of the visible universe". </p>

<p>Personal and cultural myths evolve according to lawful principles. A theory of cognitive evolution proposed by D. Campbell holds that historical changes in cognitive products (such as language, art and science) is determined by an evolutionary process that meets three criteria. First there must be variation. In the case of biological evolution, variation is supplied by such factors as mutation. In the case of cognitive evolution, variation is insured by group and individual differences in memory, learning, and the combination of elements into new syntheses. The second necessary factor is selection; some consistent process must operate to favor one trait over another. In biology, a more adaptive trait increases the probability that its possessors will survive and reproduce. In cognitive evolution, the ideas that are reinforced (because they are interesting, useful, or pleasurable) tend to survive. Finally, there must be <em>retention</em> for evolution to occur. In biology, sexual reproduction insures that the traits selected are retained and passed on to others. In cognitive evolution, language and ideas are learned from other people. These principles are applicable as we explore the historical processes by which mythology, consciousness, and culture have evolved in concert.</p>

<h2>The EVOLUTION Of CONSCIOUSNESS as the PERSONALIZING Of MYTHOLOGY</h2>

<p>In previous works, my colleagues and I reviewed literature showing that over the course of human evolution, the epicenter of consciousness and, thus, the locus of myth-making has expanded from the life of the body to include the consensual reality of the group and, in recent history, the vested concerns of the individual ego. Thus, a distinguishing feature of the modern era in technologically advanced Western cultures is that people have achieved greater autonomy than ever before in formulating the myths that guide their lives. The main points of those arguments are presented here in greater detail, along with a discussion of the advantages and the challenges this development poses to the culture's evolving mythology. </p>

<p>Biologist Lewis Thomas noted that "our most powerful story, equivalent in its way to a universal myth, is evolution". One of the most provocative facts about human evolution is that while the structure of the brain has remained essentially unchanged for at least 40,000 years, consciousness has evolved dramatically for the human species; language and myth-making replaced genetic mutation as the primary mechanisms by which individual awareness and societal innovations were carried forward. Times of transformation in the nature of the myths people hold are milestones in the evolution of human consciousness and are at the hub of historical change. </p>

<p>Jean Gebser has described the historical unfolding of four major "structures of consciousness" which he termed the Archaic, the Magical, the Mythic, and the Rational - the latter being the current era where consciousness is dominated by the rational, self-reflecting, individual ego. We will follow Ken Wilber's astute synthesis of Gebser with Freud, Jung, Piaget, Joseph Campbell, Erich Neumann, Ernst Cassirer, L.L.Whyte, and Julian Jaynes in surveying these four major "epochs" in the growth of consciousness and examining how the creating of guiding myths had become an increasingly personal matter... in the next issue. </p>

Here, we will look at three of these four mythological 'Epochs'. Part three (in the next issue) will conclude this study.</em></p>

<h2>The Archaic Epoch</h2>

<p>Some three million years ago, humanlike creatures were making tools and walking on two legs. Ken Wilber portrays humanity's earliest eras as involving no sense of self separate from the experience of the body; the first stages of human evolution were "dominated by physical nature and animal body". The earliest humans were immersed in the subconscious realms of their biological existence in what anthropologists have termed a <em>participation mystique</em>. They did not experience themselves as separate from their surroundings. Self and world were "basically undifferentiated, embedded, fused and confused". Wilber speculates that out of this primitive unity, with no capacity for verbal representation or true mental reflection yet developed, there could be no experience of anxiety (fear of that which is not present), no real comprehension of death, and thus no existential fears.</p>

<p>Sagan has wondered if "the Garden of Eden is not so different from Earth as it appeared to our ancestors of some three or four million years ago, during a legendary golden age when the genus <em>Homo</em> was perfectly interwoven with the other beasts and vegetables. These [Eden myths] all correspond reasonably well to the historical and archaeological evidence". Neumann noted that this period, which is represented mythologically as the uroboros (a serpent biting its own tail), "corresponds to the psychological stage in man's prehistory when the individual and the group, ego and unconscious, man and the world, were so indissolubly bound up with one another that the law of participation mystique, of unconscious identity, prevailed between them". </p>

<p>The Archaic Epoch roughly parallels the infantile "sensorimotor period" hypothesized by Piaget. During this period of their development, children are unable to differentiate between themselves and anything else in the world. They do not distinguish between inner and outer, between stimuli that come from their own bodies, such as hunger, and those that come from the outside, such as light. If we may speak of cultural myths at all during this period, we would call this the dreamlike era of a <em>unified, primordial bodymyth</em>. Consciousness was fully identified with the life of the body - the two were isomorphic. Instinctual impulses and conditioned responses functioned without competition from "higher" mental processes in motivating these protohumans. Reality was structured primarily around the pleasures, the pains, and the perceptions emerging from one's biological self. Thoughts regarding the aspects of life that concern mythology, such as identity and purpose, were direct and concrete. The life of the body was the life of myth. As Freud once noted, the ego is "first and foremost a body-ego".</p>

<h2>The Magical Epoch</h2>

<p>It was probably not until 200,000 years ago, with the Neanderthals, that the ability to clearly differentiate between oneself and one's environment began to emerge, although the ability may not have become fully developed, according to Wilber, until as late as 10,000 B.C. Adam and Eve's mythical "Fall" and departure from the Garden of Eden may be likened to the shift to this epoch. Human beings "fell" from their close identity with nature, and "fell" into self awareness with its accompanying anxiety, guilt, pain and vulnerability. Houston has speculated that the infant, after birth, may recapitulate the Archaic Epoch "in some thirty months equivalent to" that whole stage of humanity's development. And then the Fall. The realization that there is a dividing line between self and the rest of the world robs the infant of his or her innocent sense of omnipotence. The most elemental personal myth, constructed from the Eden-like peace of the embryo's unity in the womb, is rudely shattered with the first taste of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the dawning of selfconsciousness. According to Houston, as individual consciousness arose, myths of Paradise and the Fall developed, which she has interpreted as the "widespread nostalgia for the integral world of the childhood in man". </p>

<p>Wilber explains that out of the "almost' paradisical' state of dreamy immersion" in the world of nature came the awakening of a highly individual awareness and a 'loss' of a primitive slumber". He uses the mythological image of the Typhon, half man and half snake, to represent the epoch. Typhon, son of Gaia, the Greeks' Earth goddess, had separated himself from the Earth but his mind and body were still unified. While people of this era were no longer totally immersed in nature, events in dreams were considered to be as real as waking experiences, and artistic images were accorded the same validity as the objects they represented. The animal paintings found in Paleolithic caves are thought to bear silent witness to the magical rituals used to insure success in hunting, in which art and object are fused. </p>

<p>Reality in this era was patterned after the recognition of "me" and "other," and it was experienced in the trance-like relationship of the newly-emerged self to the world. Wilber emphasizes that during this period, the self, while distinguished from the natural environment "remains magically intermingled with it". The self has become differentiated from the environment in these early stages of mental evolution, but it is still embedded in and undifferentiated from the body, it is still a "bodyself." While the distinction between person and environment has come into being, the boundary is still fluid and porous. Subject and object, image and reality, are not yet fully differentiated in this era. People are at the center of their world and magically intermingled with it. An object was treated as the same as the image of it, a word the same as what it represented, a dream the same as the events it portrays. A man dreaming would not think of the dream as a construction or a symbol, but rather as something which actually occurred in the "other world". Studies of traditional cultures suggest that he might be compelled to retaliate for the harm done, though his revenge might also take place in a· dream or other symbolic form. To manipulate the symbol, according to this magical logic, was to affect the object symbolized. Wilber elaborates: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"That magical world, primitive but real enough, which in us moderns has been relegated to the state of dreaming, was apparently conscious in our remote ancestors. As Freud put it, <em>'What once dominated waking life, while the mind was still young and incompetent, seems now to have been banished into the night'</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the child's development, the Magical Epoch roughly parallels Piaget's "preoperational period". Four year old children are typically embedded in their perceptions, but are no longer at the mercy of them. Children at this stage cannot distinguish between image and reality; they cannot easily be consoled by being told "but it's only a dream." They believe that if they make a wish, it will be granted-and they are upset when this logic proves to be faulty. In a similar manner, humans in the Magical Epoch were convinced that their rituals brought back the sun when it disappeared during an eclipse, or that their sacrifices prevented earthquakes and other disaster. </p>

<p>This epoch, in which consciousness is not as differentiated as it will become in subsequent mythological expressions, might be thought of as the <em>magical era of mythic participation</em>. The self had emerged from its environment and was magically participating in its newly discovered world, but this involvement was laced with magical beliefs that blurred the relationship between inner and outer life in self-aggrandizing ways. In this stage, the primitive mythology of the clan or the tribe defined the nature of the magic that permeated life, and it dictated how individuals would participate in that magic. The mythic structuring of reality at this time was still bound by the body, it still antedated cognitive thought, but an external world was now recognized and responsibility for events could be assigned to it. the foundation of a mythology that separates self from other had now emerged, but the far-reaching implications of its development were yet to be realized.</p>

<h2>The Mythical Epoch</h2>

<p>Where the development of the oppositional thumb made possible the use of complex tools, the ability to conceptualize the difference between "self" and "other" prepared the way for such cognitive abilities as delaying one's responses, planning for the future, and becoming aware of death. By the time of the Cro-Magnons some 50,000 years ago, the brain had increased in size, become reorganized neurologically, and sophisticated forms of language had emerged. According to some informed estimates, however, language sophistication reached its full influence only as recently as 10,000 B.C. </p>

<p>At that time, according to Wilber, cognitive abilities had expanded so that people were able to anticipate the future more accurately, and thus plan and farm for it. "Still close to the lilies of the field, mankind took no extended thought of the morrow, and therefore neither toiled nor tilled the earth". But when tribes that had once subsisted on hunting and gathering began to settle down and cultivate crops, the anthropological evidence is unequivocal that they "sustained the most prodigious mutation in consciousness that had yet appeared". The world of agriculture is the world of extended time, of making preparations for the future harvest, and gearing the actions of the present toward important goals. The farmer had to learn how to control, postpone, and sublimate instinctive body-bound activities for the benefit of the crop. With language, the verbal mind could differentiate itself . more definitely from the physical body. People began to understand that the word is not the object for which it stands. The physical world could be represented and manipulated through mental symbols. All the requirements for developing sophisticated mythologies had become available. The hard-earned knowledge and deeper insights of the elders could now be represented in myth and carried to new generations by means of story and ritual.</p>

<p>In Wilber's scheme, language was the major psychological vehicle for this new development in consciousness. He presents evidence showing that humankind possessed no truly developed language during the magical era, and was thus structurally incapable of projecting into the future or of organizing itself in large membership communities. But "because language transcends the present, the new self could transcend the body. Because language transcends the given, the new self could see into tomorrow. Because language embodies mental goals and futures, the new self could delay and channel its bodily desires". With language, people could rise above " the prison of the immediate" and envision long-term goals. "From this point on, humanity would be able to reproduce itself not just physically (food) and biologically (sex) but also culturally (mind). For the reproduction of the human mind, generation to generation, is an act of <em>verbal communication</em>". </p>

<p>In this Mythic Epoch, personal mythologies closely mirrored the mythology of the culture. Individuals had not yet fully developed the mental capacities required for self-reflection. This period resembles the child's "concrete-operational" stage in Piaget's schema. The 10 year-old child is able to categorize concrete objects and make simple inferences. More objective than the preoperational child, these children are still unable to consider meanings outside the concrete world or to contemplate on the design behind the phenomena they can observe. Human beings in the Mythic Epoch were able to engage in social learning but were not able to reflectively establish much perspective on what was being passed down to them. If a person violated a taboo or other norm of the group-even if the infraction were due to some unusual and unavoidable situation-the person typically would be punished, and there would be no question in anyone's mind that the punishment was justified. Without the capacity for self-reflection, the individual is not yet capable of questioning the social code, nor would the group be in a position to make allowances for extenuating circumstances. Ashley Montagu noted that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"in non-literate societies the acts of the individual are believed by everyone to have consequences for the group as a whole; hence, the individual tends to regulate his conduct by the recognition of his social responsibility to the group". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the development of language and of community relationships that in some ways transcended the powers of nature, mythology came into full bloom, and the results can be observed in the stunning mythic tales of such areas as ancient China, Crete, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, India, Mexico, and Peru. As the verbal mind climbed out from the body, the accumulated wisdom of the group as communicated by myth, gave structure to the mind's extraordinarily flexible capacity for defining reality. These myths were carried to new generations via language as well as other cultural forms such as art, ritual and religious and civic practices. The individual's emerging sense of self took the form prescribed by the culture's mythology. During this era, the cultural myths that structure reality were all-important and all-pervasive. In this pre-rational, pre-personal era of cultural mythology, the society's mythology reigned supreme. </p>

<p>Wilber describes the next stage of evolution in terms of a "final differentiation and crystallization of the mind out of the body". In the earlier stages, responsibility for one's fate was lodged primarily in the external world and its objects, which Gebser interprets as "a sure sign of egolessness." Now the separate ego, the sense of a personal self that is the core of the modern individual's identity, had emerged from its previous embeddedness in nature. Based upon a provocative analysis of the historical record, the psychologist Julian Jaynes concluded that prior to the second millennium B.C., humanity had not yet developed the self-reflecting ego that characterizes modern consciousness. Surveying the use of linguistic metaphors, Jaynes speculated that only between the second and first millennia B.C. in the Western World had an "I" developed that could form inner narratives and consider alternative actions. This shift corresponds to the writing of the New Testament, where the relationship with God had become personal rather than to the Old Testament, where God's covenant was with the people of Israel. Whether or not Jaynes' dates and thesis regarding the implications of his source documents are correct, the development of an independent sense of self operating as a self-reflecting agent has been one of the crowning achievements of evolution. </p>

<p>L.L. Whyte noted that as individuals became more self-conscious, their decisions were increasingly dominated and controlled by the particular form of their own thought processes rather than "primarily by instinctive responses to external stimuli and by mimicry of the forms of a stable social tradition". Instinctive and traditional reactions to the outer world were no longer the only available guides for behavior and the internal structures we are calling "personal myths" increasingly became the basis of decision-making. Wilber suggests that close examination of the collective mythologies at the beginning of the "egoic" period unequivocally reveals that an entirely different form of myth began to appear - the "Hero Myth." He notes "the true hero myths do not emerge before this period because there were no egos before this period" (p. 184). Joseph Campbell observed that the principle "represented by the freely willing, historically effective hero not only gained but held the field and has retained it to the present. Moreover, this victory of the principle of free will, together with its moral corollary of individual responsibility, establishes the first distinguishing characteristic of specifically Occidental myth" (p. 24). </p>

<p>A distinction between the mythic-magical qualities of primitive thought and the mythic nature of all thought should be emphasized here. While thought in the <em>Mythic Epoch</em> was more advanced than the "primary process thinking" of earlier eras, the logical qualities that allow one's assumptions to be tested through deductive reasoning had not yet been developed. Thus for the primitive, all experience had to be interpreted in terms of the dominating myth; the culture's mythology created the lived reality. The cognitive abilities required to challenge its appropriateness had not been developed. </p>

<p>As consciousness evolved, however, so did the ability to reflect, to step out of the myth and consider the way the myth structures experience. While stepping out of a particular myth is neither easy nor instinctive, the capacity to do so marks the birth of psychological freedom. This monumental and far-reaching development, which led to the evolution of modern science, makes it conceivable that a people can speed the process by which they free themselves from the inadequacies of their mythic inheritance, a particularly critical matter in a rapidly changing world. </p>

<p>Piaget's stage of "formal operational thought," which develops during adolescence, is parallel to the type of thinking that emerged in the Rational Epoch. With the advent oft his period both in psychological development and in the historical epoch, reasoning about reasoning became possible. The mind becomes capable of turning back upon itself and reflecting on what it perceives. With the maturation of the ego, self-awareness reached the point that individuals were capable of making decisions with some measure of objectivity. The four stages of cognitive development portrayed to this point have a pyramidal relationship to one another. Advanced cultural and personal myths rest upon earlier myths that came to terms with the life of the body and the separation of self from the environment. The essential tenets of each subsequent stage must be integrated into previous stages and each emerging stage may disrupt mythic explanations worked out in earlier stages. </p>

<h2>THE DAWNING ERA OF A POST-CARTESIAN MYTHOLOGY</h2>

<p>Unlike the pre-Cartesian mythologies of earlier periods, the Western individual's identity was not founded upon the schism produced by the Cartesian mind-body split that came to dominate Newtonian thought (Berman, 1984). The functions once served by classical mythology were neglected and belittled as instinct was devalued in favor of rationality and community was devalued in favor of individualism. The inability of the newly emergent ego to integrate its activities with the prior realms of instinct, emotion and "body-self" is, in Wilber's eyes, the culture's essential dilemma. He points out that "Even [Erich] Neumann, arch-champion of the Hero Myth, dearly recognized that the clearly thrust went way too far and 'with this, the great reevaluation of the feminine begins, its conversion into the negative, thereafter carried to extremes in the patriarchal religions of the West"' (Wilber, 1981 p.189). </p>

<p>Preoccupation with the self as an entity separate from both body and reference group, necessary for the development of rational thought and individuality, became exaggerated. These separations, which were painstakingly achieved, are not easily transcended. The conquering hero of the contemporary era has ripped himself away from Mother Nature, spearheaded by a belligerent personal ego and supported by increasingly sophisticated technology. Wilber explains the dilemma in terms of the relationship of humanity to its biological nature, the mythical "Great Mother": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ego, in the necessary course of its emergence, had to break free of the Great Mother or biological nature embeddedness. That is all well and good-the ego, in fact, did manage to break free of its attachment and subservience and establish itself as an independent, wilful and constellated center of consciousness, a feat represented in the Hero Myths. But in its zeal to assert its independence, it not 'only transcended the Great Mother, which was desirable; it repressed the Great Mother, which was disastrous. And there the ego - the Western ego - demonstrated not just an awakened assertiveness, but a blind arrogance... no longer harmony with the Heavens... but a technological assault on Nature. It is one thing to gain a freedom from the fluctuations of nature, emotions, instincts and environment - it is quite another to alienate them. (pp. 187-188)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The personal costs of this emphasis on individuality have been tallied in terms of anxiety, uncertainty and a lack of rootedness, commitment and community. The forces of history, however, seem to be pushing toward an integration of the dualism, toward an era of what might be termed a "post Cartesian mythology," where the individual ego and the primordial nature from which it emerged will be re-united at a higher level of integration. Such holistic thinking involved the "dialectical operations" that Riegel has proposed as the final stage of cognitive development, following Piaget's "formal operation thought". </p>

<p>New guiding myths that transcend the emphasis on individualism which characterized the present era are unfolding. Moving from the prerational, pre-personal, pre-Cartesian myths of Wilber's Mythic Epoch and past the self-centered, Cartesian thought structures of the Rational Epoch, the myths that are now beginning to appear possess a distinctly post-Cartesian or post-personal or trans-personal character. That is, while individuality remains a prominent feature in these guiding myths, they reincorporate community values which transcend the personal ego and they achieve a re-attunement with nature and the life of the spirit. Sampson has emphasized the distinction between a one-sided self-contained individualism and an ensembled individualism that completes the circle by promoting community values. </p>

<p>The influences forging such a post-personal mythology range from our discontented isolation as individual egos to the stringent demands of the global crisis. Wilber believes that we can identify people who are already living according to the mythology of the coming era. He emphasizes that he described the first four epochs in the evolution of consciousness in terms of the average person's experiences and level of awareness. But he also notes that there are individuals whose lives reflect "the growing tip of human consciousness," the most advanced level of their time. The individuality that has become widespread in our culture was first restricted to sanctioned leaders. Wilber speaks of the first ones to live out the next major structure of consciousness as the shamans, the sages, and the saints who serve as prototypes of the advancing higher levels of consciousness. If Wilber is correct, then the self-actualizing subjects studied by Abraham Maslow may be examples of what is to come. They tended to evidence greater creativity, autonomy and ability to resolve polarities than their fellows, had more democratic (as contrasted with authoritarian) character structures and were more able to transcend thee go boundaries of a narrow sense of self. In addition,, certain universal values, such as truth, beauty and justice were stronger in their personal motivational schemes. </p>

<p>Such qualities may prove to be vital features of the expanded mythic visions we are collectively challenged to pursue. Rollo May (in press) believes that three new myths are necessary for our survival: the <em>"green myth"</em>, which would show our proper relation with nature; <em>women's liberation</em>, which would insure the rights and draw upon the talents of all people; and <em>planetism</em>, which would show the world as a place that transcends political boundaries. All three of these themes can be seen as correctives pushing to change the direction of the contemporary hero's journey. </p>

<p>The emphasis of our work has been on developing a system that teaches people to turn inward and bring greater awareness to the submerged mythology that lives through their thoughts, feelings and behavior (Feinstein and Krippner 1988). In the process, individuals increase their capacity to stretch their personal myths beyond the limitations of their culture's mythology and beyond confining beliefs and images that are rooted in their unique history. Gaining a measure of autonomy from the limiting images of culture and other early influences increases one's sense of psychological freedom and strengthens one's ability to cope within a rapidly changing world. Because personal and cultural myths evolve in tandem, beginning to understand the mythic processes that operate within their own psyches also strengthens in people the capacity to more mindfully and effectively participate in the inescapable collective mythological changes that are shaping the future of their world.</p>

  <li>How to Approach Authorities</li>

  <li>The Larger Goal</li>

  <li>The Nature of the Terrorist</li>

  <li>The Nature of the Victim</li>

  <li>How to Bring it all Together</li>

</ol>

<h2>I. How to Begin with the Present Situation (Grief, Anger, Retaliation)</h2>

<p>Any dispute or attack may be painful and difficult, but also an opportunity for your community to become a more enriching place for all. It is a chance for you to become a more whole person. Let this problem be an opportunity to realize that conflict is a central, unsolved issue in all cultures. </p>

<p>Whether you must deal with conflict in yourself alone, with others, or face professional dispute work with participants in extreme states of consciousness, remember that any discussion or expressions of feelings about past pain and injury are not only due to past events; they are experiences people have in the present. Now, we are hurting, now we may be retaliating at ourselves or others. Remember that it takes time to grieve and to feel sadness. Thoughts of revenge can be an edge to feeling pain, just as depression can be an edge to anger. </p>

<p>Whatever happens, remember your long time dream of a good life for all, keep this global view while dealing with any given momentary situation. Recognize that anyone who is angry — including yourself— is potentially dangerous. Tread gently. Be careful and don’t forget the outer aggressors are always a mirror image of what you might possibly look like, either now or at another point in your life. </p>

<p>The situation outside is not new; your whole life has been filled with ‘terrorist attacks’ against you, and attacks you have leveled at others. Learn collaboration insights and make processing conflict a habit from now on. </p>

<p>If possible, find the most insightful leader within yourself who is a martial artist, someone who will use her full awareness to follow and not repress issues so that they become terrorist attacks. This is an ‘inner’ someone who can feel all sides; yet not be in conflict herself with herself. </p>

<p>Before going to step II, recall that the world is both inner and outer work. Remember a time when you were repressed by someone and felt pushed into the role of the angry terrorist as a result. Also, please recall how you have done the same to others, how you repressed or would not hear them, and how —as a result —they became upset with you. If you can recall instances in which you became a ‘terrorist’ and caused others to be terrorists, you are prepared for the next step. If you cannot recall such instances, anything you do will not be based upon solid footing, and is less likely to be helpful. </p>

<h2>How to Approach ‘Authorities’</h2>

<p>Remember you are an authority simply because you consciously went through the previous experiences, a-f. Others may not realize that when they discuss the world situation, they are talking about themselves. </p>

<p>Outer people in authority—such as city and world ‘leaders’— may not have had any awareness training. Tell them in a heartfelt manner that what we’re going to do is both elegant and insightful, both rapid and sustainable—but it will include sensing more than their momentary feelings. The feeling skill to use with people in authority which works best is an appreciation for their dilemma. They’re caught in the crossfire of public life. They must satisfy both those who want revenge and those interested in love. </p>

<p>Whatever you suggest, insist that it is only an addition to what they are already planning, not as a reversal or overthrow of their methods. Remember, mainstream thinking is the way you think when you react without much awareness. So have compassion in all that you do. Now let’s go to the next step. </p>

<h2>III. The Larger Goal</h2>

<p>Deep in your heart, deep in the quietness of the night, your grandest visions include hope for the future of humanity and the planet earth. Formulate those grand visions now. After thinking of these visions, consider how you can model them in all that you do. Imagine right now using your vision, and see yourself modeling it. A vision works only with a model. </p>

<p>If necessary, amplify your vision with the following ‘addition.’ Nature moves us; our job is to make these movements conscious and useful. Dreams and emotions, love and anger happen. Our job is to guide these feelings so that they enrich our own and everybody else’s life, the life of all sentient beings. This ‘addition’ to your vision implies that life itself is a sacred event, even though it sometimes seems impossible. Life is not just a problem, but a kind of spiritual fighting ring, a temple requiring your utmost ability and wisdom. Nothing less than the grandest part of you is needed in an ultimate situation. The present moment is an opportunity, not only a threatening catastrophe. With this view, we can now go to the next step.</p>

<h2>IV. The Nature of the ‘Terrorist’</h2>

<p>The biggest problem for most of us will be to comprehend the nature of the energy and motivations of the terrorist. When you or I or anyone else becomes an angry terrorist wanting to hurt or retaliate without feeling for those who are being hurt, we are revealing something all of us human beings have experienced at one time or another. The point is that the terrorist is not unknown to you. She or he is who you become in injured states of consciousness. </p>

<p>A central aspect of the terrorist is the ‘freedom fighter,’ someone who wants a newer, better, and just world for herself and her own. Another aspect of the terrorist is the spiritual seeker who has found a goal that is greater than life itself, something that makes even her own life, or its sacrifice, insignificant. That is why threats of imprisonment or counter attack, never deter terrorists. Still another aspect of terrorism is terror itself. The terrorist has transformed fear into fury. Fear, terror, and anger are very close. Terror is often due to the fear of being hurt by an omnipotent aggressor. Anger comes from the sweet feeling of revenge mixed with the ecstatic power of aggression, which feels to the aggressor as the opposite to victimhood. </p>

<p>In a way, the terrorist has inadvertently become a mirror image of the thing she or he hates the most. She or he is a product of hopelessness, created in part by everybody else’s misunderstanding of who she or he is and what she or he stands for. Now let’s go to the next step. </p>

<h2>V. The Nature of the ‘Victim’</h2>

<p>The ‘victim’ (or in the case of Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the U.S, the one with more overt political, social or military power) is the ‘aggressor’ in the mind of the terrorist. The ‘victim’ is the ‘innocent’ one who has been attacked, and who identifies as being a victim. Now what we are going to say must be understood with compassion. The victim is the one who uses and remains in her victimhood to ease the guilt of being unconscious of her role in creating or at least collaborating in creating terrorism. The victim is in one way, partly responsible for the attack. She did not notice, she ignored or was unwilling or unable to face the terrorist, to hear her unhappiness, even when the signals of discontent were still mild or at least moderate and non destructive. </p>

<p>Consistent ignoring, repressing, dominating, and feeling you are better than someone else creates a false sense of peace, then come more rules, laws, police, military, and finally more war. This is not a criticism of the so-called victim, it’s really a compassionate embracing and understanding of unconsciousness followed by a supportive nudge to wake up. Nothing ever happens out of the clear blue sky. The clouds were thick for days, months, decades, and in some cases centuries while everyone pretended it was a sunny day. </p>

<p>Insights about the roles of the terrorist and victim can usually occur only with hindsight. In dealing with a victim (or a terrorist), we need at first to accept that she identifies herself as the innocent bystander. Then we must be ready to understand the victim’s deadly intent; retaliate and destroy the terrorist. Only after having had compassion with this one-sidedness, can we go to the next step. It is our experience that as long as you feel spiritually superior to the ‘victim’s’ (or the terrorist’s) aggressiveness, you should not try to help. Instead, realize that you too need help. You too are waging a kind of war and add to, but do not solve the problem. When you are ready, please go to the next step. </p>

<h2>VI. How to Bring It All Together</h2>

<p>If you’re not able to directly influence the military or negotiate at the peace tables, be a mayor or a president, you can still speak up in your group, your house of worship, on email, in local papers and with your neighbor next door. Know that war is everywhere, not just on a given battlefield. Terror is anytime you think about it. Your inner and outer work are all forms of ‘Worldwork’ touching a global field which influences a few or many individuals not only directly, but everyone indirectly through the quantum waves of non-locality. </p>

<p>After finding your inward center, a source of quietness in the midst of movement, try the following. Using your knowledge of the terrorist and victim, speak for, feel for, and act out each side, one at a time. If you do it alone, it’s inner work. When done with others, this is group work. Do it on TV. It’s Worldwork. As the terrorist, speak of your hatred, speak of history. Speak of the things you stand for which are more important than your personal life. Don’t just act or play this out. This is not only roleplay. Let it be authentic, a deep and penetrating dance moving your body. Be a shaman and experience shape shifting into the nature of the forces of this universe. Feel the terrorist’s body and notice how the words coming from her/his mouth come from the marrow of your bones. Go deeply and way beyond anything you’ve ever done before. Use your awareness and let your feelings go to infinity. When this feels done, switch sides. </p>

<p>Speak as the tortured ‘victim.’ Vehemently warn about your imminent retaliation. Describe all the personal and social privileges you know about, speak of your desire for peaceful, quiet, and loving relationships. Now go deeper. If you’re playing the US, get to the essence of New York. Not just the empire state building, but the lantern held proudly by that democratic spirit called the Statue of Liberty. Remember yourself as a dream of that home, an open door for those who have been oppressed. After admitting that you have not always been able to live that dream, remember your grandest vision and striving for democracy. Look into the roots of your heart and speak for 250 million people about the glimmer of hope that holds them together, a filament of light making them sometimes an unconscious monster but potentially an open heart, ready to accept anything, even those who have attacked her. If you could say this with honesty, to yourself, to others, to the papers and the TV, you have gone beyond the USA to the roots of democracy. Now it is time to go on. </p>

<p>If you do this with others, amazing and unpredictable things may happen among participants. Carry on this conversation for a maximum of two hours, then let go and say goodbye to all the spirits on your inner or outer stages. Go home and think it over. As many things happen in silence as they do in public. There is much more to do. There’s a song to be sung about freedom and life, a dance and theater needing to recapitulate the essence of this world drama and the dream like realities unfolding before our amazed eyes. There are more dreams to dream on, the future to work with. Thank you for trying. We recognize this is too general to be used as such, but hopefully broad enough to inspire your engagement. ✡ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>It was September 22, 1991 and I arrived promptly at Dr. Glenn’s office for my Radix Bodywork session. I had no idea that the life I thought I had been living was about to crumble like so many pieces of stale bread. </p>

<p>In the course of my four year tenure with Drs. Linda and Austen Glenn, I began to experience a series of visions that disturbed and intrigued me. The images that revealed themselves to me had come flooding forth, unraveling in the most unexpected way. Each new insight brought its own unique cascade of terrifying emotions, but the nature of the work kept pulling me back. Not unlike peeling succeeding layers of skin from an onion, I set about the task of looking deep within my own psyche. Other trips I had made to my inner landscape had always been fruitful, but none had led me to the place I was about to go. </p>

<p>As I dragged my feet slowly up the red brick steps to Linda and Austen’s office in their suburban Conway home, I felt a deep sense of dread. I stopped for a moment on their front porch to take a deep breath as I remembered how painful my last session had been. I took a long look at the cascading ivy that tumbled off their porch and covered most of their lawn. I could smell the delicious fragrance of the thick white Gardenia blossoms that dotted the bushes next to their porch like so many clusters of perfume drenched clouds, drunk on their own elixir. I opened their front door, listening to the familiar creak of the hinges as Linda met me with open arms and a warm, inviting embrace. </p>

<p>As I lay on my green mat in the middle of the hardwood floor, a series of cartoon-like figures unraveled inside my head. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A tall, dark man appeared first, etched in red. Initially, he seemed to carry a red cane. I could scarcely breathe as I watched this walking stick turn into an erect penis, which he rubbed over the naked body of a little girl. Then the image folded up like a paper fan, transformed into a vertical black line in my field of vision. A little girl’s voice spoke out: “Bad boy! You were not supposed to come out.” Next, I saw the chubby fingers of a child’s right hand, holding a key. She reached over and locked the black line, as if it were a door.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the years to come, I would embark on an odyssey of epic proportions, leaving my body and soul wracked in agony. I would journey even further inward, back through time and space, even past the dark holes of my personal past, and finally arriving face to face with spiritual ecstasy. </p>

<p>This story is a tale of redemption and renewal, death and rebirth, and triumph over darkness. But most importantly, this is a love story. Alone and utterly forsaken, adrift on treacherous waters, I was joined by a celestial figure of light whose name is simply Grandfather. As a psychologist in practice for over 13 years when I began uncovering the secrets of my past, I was already well acquainted with much of the literature on childhood abuse. I knew that betrayal in the form of sexual abuse creates an opening —a sacred wound —through which the Divine may enter. It is no accident that abused children often have greater access to the world of the spirits; they have, after all, been penetrated. </p>

<p>I don’t know for sure when I first encountered the black ravens of despair, but I strongly suspect they have been with me all my life. I do remember, however, hearing them at the age of four when I traveled by train to St. Louis with my great aunt to see my grandparents. The ravens awoke when my grandmother said it was time for me to take a bath. When I realized that my grandmother and aunt planned to bathe me — naked — the haunting screams of the ravens reverberated inside my head. The flapping of their wings as they began to tear at my heart, sent me into a panic. No one, not even I, realized that the ravens had good reason to fear the vulnerability of a naked body. </p>

<p>Being the oldest of five children, I often spent long periods of time alone when I was very young, and I had a very rich and active relationship with an imaginary playmate named Jocko. I was emotionally troubled, always anxious and afraid, and I had a very difficult time making friends. </p>

<p>I remember my grandmother as my guardian angel. She actually paid attention to me and often intervened in my defense; I knew clearly that she was an answer to my prayers. No one else did that. The ravens went mad when she died. The clawing and tearing, the awful screaming inside my head, seemed endless. </p>

<p>I did have one secret that was all mine, something no one could take from me. I discovered a world full of brightly colored fantasy creatures with whom I carried on many lengthy conversations. And, best of all, Jocko lived here! I delighted in my ability to escape to this other world where I could leave behind all the emptiness and misery of my real one. Until - one day when I tried to talk to my parents about my friend Jocko and the world he inhabited. “Crazy,” they called me. “Evil,” they said. And I believed them. </p>

<p>By the time I started school, I suffered from nightmares, eating problems, and behavior problems. I found out years later when my father inexplicably handed me my childhood medical files, that I had been diagnosed as emotionally disturbed in grade school. And the doctor had discovered two outbreaks of vaginitis. The ravens were nowhere to be found. </p>

<p>After successfully battling major depression, a result of grief over my divorce in 1985, I found myself grappling with mysterious physical ailments. I sought medical advice from family doctors, chiropractors, and neurosurgeons. But no one could explain the unremitting insomnia, back pain, and chronic dis-ease and anxiety that plagued me. Psychotherapy and bodywork provided only minor relief. </p>

<p>Then the dreams began—strange images of a small hysterical child, hurling herself against the fiery red, burning walls of a pit, desperately wanting out of this “burning place”. And in 1988, there was this dream: A body of water stands surrounded by trees and flanked by mountains to the left. A large number of tribal chieftains march over the ridge of these mountains blowing their tribal horns. I am awe struck, thinking to myself within the dream state that this must be a very significant dream and one that I must share with my dream group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I watch myself walking on the water towards the base of the mountain. I now realize these tribal elders are calling me. I am dressed in a thin white gown as I climb up the side of the mountain where I discover a younger Indian man. I am now naked as we perform a ritual. White smoke billows all around us as he dances in a circle around me. It is okay that I am naked because he and I will never marry. The elders watch as the ceremony proceeds. The Indian man and I walk off arm in arm as we are now to be married.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On September 15, 1992 I began seeing a therapist named Anna. I knew very little about Anna except that she had an excellent reputation and that she was very interested in Buddhism. The day dawned bright and sunny as I dragged myself out of bed after another sleepless night. My heart felt heavy and the burning sensation in my stomach I had been living with for over a year, seemed worse than usual. How I managed to drag my listless body up those many steps to her office, I will never know. </p>

<p>With Anna’s help and encouragement, I began paying close attention to the visions that had begun resurfacing earlier that same year, during daily meditations. During this time, I frequently meditated for 3 to 4 hours at a time. I began to record everything in painstaking detail and the visionary process intensified over the next three years. By early 1993, a spirit by the name of Lady in White (LIW) began confronting me with some unexpected and frightening material.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>1/24/93:</strong> LIW stands off in the distance, on top of a purple mountain silhouetted against a celestial moon. She holds a tiny baby dressed in white garments and circles round a blazing fire, stopping at each of the four directions to elevate the child to the heavens. As she hands the infant to me, I notice a large amethyst crystal embedded in her forehead. “She has been called forth to do some important healing work on earth,” the Lady explains. “Everything is about to come together for her but her soul will feel as if it is being ripped and torn into many pieces.” LIW places her hand over the purple stone that is beginning to take shape on my own forehead</em></p>
  
  <p><em>“This is the mark we have given her. It is designed to provide an opening. She will be illuminated from within and without and she will know. She is meant to illuminate the earth, to shine light upon all she encounters. She must know the burning nature of this light.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>1/25/93</strong> LIW dances joyously on top of the purple mountain, arms outstretched to the sky. The brilliant moon stands as silent witness to her supplications as the stars wink in appreciation. The baby, ashen in color and barely breathing, lies prostrate on the ground in a coffin-like pit. The amethyst in her forehead barely flickers and her skin is bluish-gray. I am worried that she is close to death, but the Lady explains that she is just awaiting rebirth. I watch in horror as LIW dumps mounds of dirt on top of the baby. Thin blades of light stab at the air from beneath the soil and a roaring fire explodes from the slivers of light. The fire burns itself out, leaving the little pit looking whitewashed. The baby is nowhere in sight. A tiny amethyst stone is all that remains of her. A bolt of lightning crashes down from the heavens, striking the purple stone. A liquid begins to sizzle and bubble around the crystal. From this liquid, white smoke appears forming a solid cloud over the pit. The smoke clears to reveal a very small frozen infant.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<p>I was seeing Anna twice a week for individual sessions and meeting with my dream group weekly, while working with my analyst three times a year during four day retreats. Amazingly enough, I managed to maintain a successful private practice and continued to meditate daily. However, I found it almost impossible to socialize with people and found myself living a sort of hermit lifestyle. Other than going to work, taking care of household chores, and visiting with my family on special occasions, I rarely left my home. Most of my friends eventually drifted away. </p>

<p>The visions continued as I grew increasingly ambivalent about the intensifying connection I felt with Anna. Even though she was very good about letting me know how to get in touch with her whenever she was out of town, the closer I felt to her, the more frightened I became that she would abandon me. I remember calling her multiple times one day, first canceling all my appointments and then calling back to reschedule. I marveled at the patience and compassion she showed me during all the years I worked with her. I know now that I owe her my life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/7/93:</strong> As I stare into a blazing fire, I make out a dark face with golden eyes wavering in and out of the flames. Mesmerized, I continue to stare as the flames die down. A huge man wearing a long white robe with golden threads now stands before me, towering miles above the earth. In the encounters to come with this mysterious and compelling man, I would come to know him as the Master.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/8/93:</strong> The Master and I stare silently at each other through the flames of a roaring fire. His eyes are definitely golden and without pupils, with black lines etched across their surface, giving him the appearance of some wild, alien creature. Still he seems Oriental, with white hair, a white goatee, and thinning hair. When the fire dies down, his eyes flash beams of light that illuminate the darkness all around me. As if by magic, my body begins to levitate as a table appears, suspended in mid-air over the embers of the fire. The Master maneuvers my body onto this table, removes my clothing, and cuts me open from neck to groin. He reaches inside the cavity and pulls out a tiny crystal clock that reads close to midnight. “It is almost time for the soul work to begin, he says.” After examining my heart, he probes deep into my uterus and discovers a baby. As he touches her lovingly, a smoky white mist begins to materialize. The Master sighs with apparent pleasure and then breathes upon the little white cloud. It immediately shudders in response and bright lights dance through its transparent form. He closes up the opening in my body and I retire to the opposite side of the fire.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Silence descends upon us. I plead with him to tell me who he is. He paces back and forth, then sits back down. A large tear rolls out of his left eye. I reach over and gently wipe it away. “You do not recognize me yet, do you?” he says. “Not yet, Master, but you told me the last time we talked that Anna would know who you are. Is this true? Do you want me to ask her?” He says that I should talk with Anna, that he and Anna know each other very well. “How will she recognize you, Master?” As I look up at him, a brilliant blue, round light forms in front of his face. Then it changes to white, outlined in blue. The Master says: “Tell her about the blue light fading into white, so brilliant there is nothing else and she will know.” As he prepares to leave, I run up to him, calling out and addressing him as Grandfather. These words fly out of my mouth, as if uttered by someone else from some other place. He is as surprised as I am. “Is Grandfather right?” I ask. “Grandfather, I do know you. I do know you, Grandfather!” Both in tears, we embrace. When I open my eyes, he is gone. I catch a glimpse of him disappearing behind a golden door. The blue light reappears, and again fades away into white. And I hear these words: “Blue light fading away into white—so brilliant there is nothing.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/14/93:</strong> I am in a strange land. White curtains hang everywhere. The winds howl and the mists are on the rise. Voices echo all around me but I see no one. The curtains form a maze through which I cannot see my way clear. A very old man appears from within the billowing white fabric columns. He wears a long brocade gown similar to the Master’s, only weighted down by heavier ornamentation and golden threads. He has very long fingernails, long hair, and a long pointed beard. He looks Oriental like Grandfather — only much older. Both his hair and beard are pure white. His long jeweled fingers beckon me to follow him and he leads me into a lavishly decorated room, embellished with gold. An ornate, golden, glasstopped case sits high on a pedestal. As I get closer, I can tell it is a casket. There is a body inside. I am overtaken with grief as I recognize my beloved Grandfather!</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I crawl up on top of the casket, weeping and crying out to him. Miraculously, I find myself once again outside amidst the maze of white curtains. The winds continue to howl as the mists gather all around me. Voices echo everywhere; shadowy forms float past me. Grandfather’s golden visage appears in the sky, and he speaks to me. “This is the land of the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown, the land of reality and unreality, of death, rebirth and reincarnation. I will be with you always.” From underneath one of the curtains crawls a little boy, pulling a red-headed little girl in a white gown. A strange light surrounds them.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2/16/93</strong></p>

<p>I saw Anna yesterday and told her about my meditations, as Grandfather had asked. Anna wore an Oriental looking silk jacket, navy blue in color with brightly colored silk flowers embroidered onto the front. I kept my eyes locked onto that jacket as I was so afraid of her reaction. What if she told me I was out of my mind? or delusional? No sane person would admit to seeing ghosts now, would they? I held my breath and traced the toe of my foot around the design on her rug as I read the entry dated 2/8/93. When I finished with the passage, I looked up to see Anna smiling at me. She indicated that I should stop reading and then she just stared at me for what seemed like an eternity. I can still remember the loud ticking of the small mahogany clock on her desk as I waited for her response. Then she took a deep breath and told me that she indeed recognized Grandfather! “His name is Medicine Buddha,” she said. She pointed to the lapis lazuli ring she wears. “I wear this stone because of my relationship with him.” </p>

<p>Chills ran up and down my body as she spoke. As I left her office, my legs felt like rubber bands and I was overcome with emotion. My journey had begun. I felt totally confused, dazed and... strangely elated. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>What we're dealing with in dreamwork, in short, is counterconditioning. Constantly we're blasted by what's all around us with what we should think and feel. It's so easy to let a lot of our decisions be made by all that noise. Meanwhile we're being just as consistently informed from within by a different source. Our dreams tell us what we do think and what we do feel and what we do perceive. </p>

<p>Dreams, like little children, can't help but be truthful. They are the accurate map to our reality. The one we're being spoon fed day and night from external sources isn't so much wrong as it is outdated, like an ancient map with inaccurately depicted shorelines. </p>

<p>Why then is it so assiduously propounded by everything and everyone around us? Because it serves to maintain things as they are and we all profit more than we care to realize by keeping things just as they are. Not just those in economic or political power who are profiting at our expense. Not just those who grow rich as we grow fat or as others starve. Not just those who get powerful when we stay poor; or who get even richer when we try to get rich. Not just those who earn fat therapy fees when we stay confused about who we really are. Not just all of those. But we ourselves benefit from keeping everything the same. It is safe. Just look at the parts of the world today where change is breaking through to the surface - Poland, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Guatemala. Change always involves turmoil, a return to chaos before the new more inclusive order emerges. It's nothing other than the creative process that is at work. Anyone who has embarked on the path of creative personal transformation knows what I mean. True work with dreams often brings disruption and indecision and chaos before it heralds in the higher level of awareness that a lone enables a deeper, truer life. It's not nice to be miserable but it's a little more bearable if we don't know it. So we read about Poland and El Salvador in the newspapers and forget our dreams. If they persist in forcing themselves upon our awareness, then we manage to not understand them. It's easier. It allows us to stay as we are. </p>

<p>If, by working with dreams, we do manage to free ourselves from an intolerable domination like Cuba or Vietnam did, we congratulate ourselves, ignoring that we may have landed under a different but equally intolerable oppressor. The movement toward freedom tries to continue as in Poland but meets powerful resistance. The chaos it entails is too disruptive. It's easier to remain fixated somewhere along the way where we can congratulate ourselves on our progress while doing everything in our power to defeat the ongoing process. But the process won't stop. It will merely find someone else in whom it can carry itself forward. Most of society is composed of dead souls, washed up on the shore of their fixation to a stagnant life. History moves through the rare individuals: "I have a dream," Martin Luther King said. </p>

<p>Domination from any one super strong component of our total souls is intolerable. Total freedom is the only aim. Freedom from within. For each part of us to be free to be what it is. Not for some other part of us, however strong and valid and important, to tell it what it should be. The repressed part will always merely go underground, into our dreams, towage its guerrilla warfare. If the smallest segment of the whole circle is rejected, we don't have a circle anymore. The tiniest excluded part of us can easily sabotage the whole and cause all our good aims to go awry. An age old axiom goes, "As without, so also within." What are our souls like? Look at our world, our society, our environment, our bodies. Need I say more? </p>

<p>So we are polluted, we are dominated, we are ravaged, we are unreal, and hence, we are ineffectual in achieving what can really make our lives work. </p>

<p>These ideas aren't new. Everybody knows these things. Read any psychology book or New Age manifesto. But such knowledge hasn't helped us. Knowing with the mind is of little import. When we know in the real sense, the only sense that signifies, we become, we transform. D.H. Lawrence, poor misled man, was right all along when he talked of "knowing with the blood." Unfortunately though, it was all an intellectualization with him. The disease that his life was eventually overtook him, as it will us all. </p>

<p>There is a way out, though. You don't even have to work with your dreams but dreamwork makes it easier, much easier, for people like us. Krishnamurti maintains that when we become enlightened we cease dreaming. Reality itself becomes the dream that we write. Nothing is forced into the underground to wage its guerrilla fight toward our awareness. Everything that we are is admitted into our being. The battle is over. Freedom is won. Life itself becomes deeper and fuller and more beautiful than we could ever dream. I haven't reached that ultimate state. I have only tasted little glimpses but these have shown me that it is the only thing worth pursuing. </p>

<p>My work with dreams has shown me that our society is a lie. Our lives are lies. The things I have wanted aren't the things I want. The things I have needed aren't the things I need. What I was and am isn't what it is to be a human being. Working with dreams and with creativity (I am writing a novel that came from a dream) has carried me to the portal of a new way of being. I started the dream community of New York perhaps because I'd rather not be alone as I take the next few steps. </p>

<p>Armed with our dreams we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around. The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women. All the rest has been noise, an externalized reverberation from these great happenings. To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The secret of dream work is that you don't need dreams to do the kind of work we do on them. These same techniques, once mastered by long and diligent work with dreams, can be applied to waking life with radical results. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>Free association</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Lie down and get into a relaxed state. Let your mind wander along any one of its innumerable habitual channels of association. The important thing is to let go of all conscious control and direction. Let what arises arise, and then let it move on to the next thing spontaneously, automatically. But each time you become aware that you are in the middle of a thought, focus on it; not on the thought itself, which is as shopworn and stale as our conscious minds themselves, but on the images behind the thought. In the pictures our minds have collected, there is a vast reservoir of information that has never been adequately processed because our consciousness was too narrow and constricted at the time by conditioning to perceive the seemingly infinite dimensions of feeling tones present. When these pictures themselves, the images upon which our thoughts are based, are revisited in this way at a later time - especially after we have worked extensively with dreams- we bring to them the much wider dimensions of consciousness we have become capable of in the interim. We can enter directly into the consciousness of those who touched our lives long ago. We can revisit the consciousness of the person we were then. When we can do that, it becomes apparent that we are not the same person now. We feel and understand who we are in a transformed way. </p>

<p>The thoughts that meander incessantly through our minds are wrong. It's not that they are in error. But they are based upon an inadequate sampling of the original experience itself. The beauty of the human system is that this experience has been ingrained directly into our brains and bodies in the form of pictures and patterns of tension. It can be revisited by revisiting the pictures directly and its hidden wealth harvested long, long after the fact. The tensions can be released directly into spontaneous emotional expression. </p>

<h2>Dialogue</h2>

<p>We have at our fingertips not only this vast reservoir of our own experience but also the near infinite experience of all the people, places, and things that have ever touched our lives, even in the most marginal way at the time. These other characters and settings can be revisited directly in the form of the images they have left imprinted in our minds. For if they touched us at any little spot, they touched us with the whole of themselves. And the whole of their wisdom and insight as well as the depth of their sickness and pain - the two categories are not something different one from the other - is ours for the asking. "Ask and it will be given to you," the Bible says, "Seek and ye shall find." If we will take the time out from our daily and meaningless chatter with ourselves and with those around us, if we move to that protected place of peacefulness within us from where the images of our past can be viewed directly, we can strike up meaningful dialogue. Of course, we find with our minds what our hearts always knew. Of course, it may turn into tears. We let our body cry. We let our heart feel what we never let it feel before. And each time we do this, we take a burden off it. Ours becomes a healthier heart. We find that the dialogue and contact with those around us in our waking life then becomes more meaningful and true. </p>

<p>We don't have to wait for dreams to work with these things. What goes on when we're dreaming is going on all the time. Dreamwork is an invaluable training and a prerequisite for this kind of waking work with images. Too few dreamworkers realize this. They become fixated on dreamwork, like a grade school pupil who keeps flunking and never makes high school There is a step beyond this waking imagery work. You graduate from the graduate school of consciousness when you take these same processes into waking life itself, when you can work with and revision your daily episodes even as they are happening. </p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>You find that a radical reframing of a situation springs readily to mind even as it is happening. You see directly how the ways you are approaching an individual or a situation are habitual and invalid. You see others directly and nakedly for what they are behind the mask and the role they appear to be playing. You notice what's missing as well as what's happening. Of course, the analysis of a situation is the recognition and acceptance of your feelings in that situation. When you feel what you are fully, you can't help but accept it, and love it. You can quit trying to make it otherwise. This happens naturally. Like I said, the human organism is an amazing instrument. We need far less control than we imagine. These things happen naturally and spontaneously when we quit interfering with them. We have been conditioned to wander around in a false dream reality all day long, but it is in our nature- if only we would allow it - to awaken from this dream of false notions into a reality of deep involvement.</p>

<h2>...and so on and so forth</h2>

<p>The same holds true for all the other multitudinous techniques of working with dreams. </p>

<p>Dreamwork itself can become incidental to the expansion of awareness. Ultimately, only by letting go of dream resolutions and resolving our conflicts in waking life can we free our dreams for deeper purposes. Their deeper purpose is to always lead us further and further toward the shores of fuller awakefulness. Is there an end to this and thus an end to dreaming as enlightened ones like Krishnamurti suggest? I don't know, I doubt that I am anywhere near that point. For me, dreamwork can still be a powerful tool for growth. I've seen the process thwarted, however, in certain individuals who, for all their prowess in the world of dreams and imagination, are unable to translate the resolution of their conflicts to waking life and so, like a branch stuck between two rocks in a fast running mountain stream swishes back and forth repeatedly with the current, all their movement is getting them nowhere. </p>

<p>Yes, what I am saying is that dreamwork, like everything else, can be an escape from life. A woman I know who is afraid of sexual relationships with men has the most incredible sexual lucid dreams with orgasms and the whole bit. Her dream prowess is like the exceptional hearing developed in certain blind people - a compensation for a defect. She pursues her dream work rigorously and has made it a profession because it enables her to sidestep her defect. And consequently, it is also ruining her life. Needless to say, there is no telling her this. Our blind spots are our hurt spots. Who appreciates the doctor who would reopen the painfully infected wound? I'm not a therapist anyway and am not about to stick my fingers in her mind. If knowledge could heal, how whole we would all be! Only the full experience of the present waking situation heals. Dreams are an avenue, not a substitute. This is a secret that some of the dream therapies ignore and some of the greatest dream workers today only pay lip service to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Here is a dialog with Christa Mackinnon. Christa is author of SHAMANISM &amp; SPIRITUALITY IN THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE, An Introduction. She lives and works as a social psychologist and family counselor in Devon, in southwest England. I am honored to introduce Christa Mackinnon to DNJ readers.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>David Sparenberg:</strong> It is well known that wider interest in matters shamanic developed out of Mercia Eliade’s study, <em>Shamanism</em>. In that foundational text, Eliade provides two key designations of the shaman as “master of ecstasy” and “technician of the sacred.” Since the counterculture of the 1960’s, there has been an uninterrupted outpouring of books on the subject. My own favorite is <em>Shamanic Voices</em> by Joan Halifax, which includes first hand accounts by practicing shamans throughout the world. So there is an established subculture of shamanic seekers and practitioners. Within this context, what is shamanism for a professional therapist in Britain? What is your shamanism? Where do you place it in life and work? </p>

<p><strong>Christa Mackinnon</strong>: David, the moment I read your first question, I couldn’t help smiling. We are already ‘in the zone’. Your favorite book is ‘Shamanic Voices’ by Joan Halifax and the first shamanic teacher who crossed my path was a friend of Joan’s and had worked with her. </p>

<p>I also love Halifax’s book. When I read it I really began to appreciate the profound understanding of, and connection to, ‘All there is’, which traditional, indigenous shamans world-over exhibit; I also was quite taken by their incredible range of skills. They were/are not only ‘technicians of the sacred’, visionaries, seers, healers, spiritual leaders, masters of the ecstatic, communicators with natural forces and creatures, overall intermediaries between earth and spirit, they were/are also political leaders, ecologists, storytellers, artists, dancers and more.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-1.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Fire altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fire Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>I find this is one of the differences between shamanic subculture now and traditional, indigenous shamans. The subculture doesn’t produce people with such vast abilities, which is one reason I am reluctant to call myself a ‘shaman’. Many of us utilize parts of this wisdom heritage and develop, adjust or integrate it. We can lament about the fact that what we now encompass under the term ‘shamanism’ doesn’t always come close to the traditional and indigenous, but I feel that shamanism has survived for so long because it is timeless and can be adapted. Personally, it plays a big part in my work and my private life, which are scarcely distinguishable. It has done so for the last 18 years, when I begun to integrate it professionally. I run countless courses for therapeutic professionals on subjects such as journeying, soul-retrieval, ancestral work, ceremonies and so on, but also facilitate wilderness camps, trance-dance groups and vision quests. I even push for it to be explored within the more conventional field of therapy and medicine. Within my therapeutic professional work, I focus more on integrating the ‘psycho-spiritual’ aspects of shamanism. I still find it difficult to accept that the vast majority of psychologists and therapists in the UK &amp; EU reject shamanism; part of what I see myself called to do is to bring it into the conventional psychotherapeutic and medical community. It is interesting that the therapeutic community is waking up to the fact that we need to address spiritual aspects of the human being, but so far is afraid to take this further than integrating a bit of ‘mindfulness’ into otherwise mainly cognitive-behavioral orientated approaches. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Another well-known classification for the shaman, especially through medical authors such as Jeanne Achterberg and Larry Dossey, is that of “wounded healer.” But not everybody who is wounded spiritually, psychologically, emotionally or physically, has a healing response, although everybody may have the capacity. Not everyone wounded becomes a shaman. Personally, I think that passion and pathos are determinates. But do you find that there is a shamanic personality type? If so, what are some key traits? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> I think there is something quite significant in the idea of the ‘wounded healer’, especially the one who has healed herself. In traditional shamanism, as far as I understand it, the wounding often refers to the ‘initiation crisis’ or the ‘call’, and it is profound, in the sense that it is of severe psychic depth. During the initiation process, the body is often quite sick, even comatose, whilst the ‘spirit’ is being taught, challenged, trained, and initiated, before it returns to the body, which then also heals. Healing referred to in this context is about becoming ‘whole’, a far cry from what we in our society see as ‘healing’, which refers mainly to symptom alleviation. </p>

<p>I don’t necessarily think that there is a ‘shamanic personality type’, but believe that there are different reasons that draw people to shamanism. Let’s start with wounding. In contemporary societies, we can say that there is individual wounding, such as we all experience to various degrees. Then there is a kind of collective wounding, which we are subjected to because the road travelled collectively results in disconnected populations in our soul-less societies. Increasing levels of anxiety disorders, depression and violence are indicators of this development. You are of course right, not everyone wounded becomes a shaman. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-2.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Water Altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Water Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>But in my experience, being drawn to shamanism often takes place through being wounded individually and/or through feeling our collective wounds. If you don’t feel that something is ‘not right’, then you have very little incentive to step off the normal road and travel down a different one. So, yes, I do know from experience that many people who travel the road of shamanism have been wounded. But having said that, as humans we also have the ability to see beyond our individual existence; so now there is a second, rather large group of people drawn to shamanism for ecological reasons. They realize that our most urgent task is to stop destroying the earth and work towards sustainability, and that we can only achieve this if we re-connect individually and collectively with nature, again becoming part of it. Shamanism helps greatly with that. A third group of people seems to come to shamanism via searching for something that makes them feel more alive and connected, helps them to re-connect with vital life forces and community, which we, in our left-brain, artificial and consumer-orientated societies have done our best to dis-connect from. Shamanism seems to open energy gates for people, as it is very physical, very earthy, very active and communal. So, to answer the question, I don’t believe there is a personality type, but I do see several reasons why certain people are drawn to shamanism and others are not.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Searching through your book, there is not much about shamanism and dreaming or shamanic dreams. I admit the subject for me is somewhat problematic. American anthropologist Alfred Kroeber coined the term “dream culture” for particular Native tribes, such as the Mohave, where culture was kept alive through tribal members dreaming mythic narratives and rituals. Traditional Lakota women are often called to “medicine” through beckoning dreams involving visitations from spirit beings and ancestors. The Greek cult of Asclepius, which was popular throughout the Mediterranean over several centuries before Christianity, practiced dream incubation as healing technique. Sometimes in the dreams of alchemists, ancient or contemporary, there are shamanic motifs, even a shamanic core, so that by peeling away the imagery of the alchemist you find the ritual of the shaman. </p>

<p>Then bringing many threads into a skein, I would say—dreaming power objects or animals, spirit guides, ancestors and archetypes could all be elements of shamanic dreaming. But I invite you now to share your experiences and your thoughts on shaman dream traits and shamanic dreaming, and how such can be of healing value to non-tribal and mostly urban-dwelling people today. What can you tell us? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> Yes, I do not specifically address ‘shamanic dreaming’ in my book because it has been written for therapeutic professionals of many creeds, and there is only a small minority of therapists and psychologists, mainly Jungians and eco-psychologists, who work with dreams. I also didn’t want to begin explaining in the book the idea of ‘dreaming’ in a shamanic sense. You already outlined much that can be said about ‘shamanic dreaming’, and of course how it overlaps with other forms of ‘work attempted in trance states’, but let me add a few bits before I come to the more individualized, western way of utilizing dreams. If we take into account what you mentioned, and if we look at tribes such as the Kogi in South America, or the Australian Aboriginal’s ‘dreamtime’, then we realize that dreaming in a shamanic sense is at least two-fold: firstly, shamanic dreaming is practiced to access wisdom, insights, guidance, rituals, healing approaches, knowledge, creativity and so on from the wider field, the spirit field; and secondly, shamanic dreaming is also practiced to create ‘reality’ within that wider energetic field, which then manifests in our material reality. So, in a way all ‘work’ undertaken by shamans or tribal members in an altered state of consciousness could be defined as ‘dreaming’. We ‘dream’ our reality into being. The Kogi, for instance, would tell you quite categorically, that this is what they do normally and that without their ‘positively dreaming the world into being’ we would have already ended in complete destruction. </p>

<p>When we use the expression “dreaming” in a westernized, contemporary way, it is for the stuff that happens when we sleep, in contrast to the shaman who dreams deliberately, even if she or he is awake. Here, in a therapeutic environment, we do not use the shamanic way of dreaming for therapeutic purposes, but we do understand that insights and wisdom can arise in dreams and that healing can take place. What we access in dreams is defined as stemming from the personal unconscious or, more rarely, the collective unconscious. But generally speaking, we apply a very limited framework compared to the framework of indigenous, older cultures. </p>

<p>I personally believe that, in comparison to shamans, we have restricted the world we access and live in because we do not access and utilize dream states deliberately. But, I will leave it at that, because your next question, which I have already seen, will give me a chance to go deeper into the whole idea of ‘altered states’. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Ok then, let’s talk about ecstasy—about shaman as master or mistress of ecstasy—and how mantic and other altered states of consciousness can be viewed as therapeutic experience and might be applied in conventional therapeutic settings. This is also a problematic topic for me. We are familiar with trance dancing, tribal-fusion dance, what is called authentic dance, Gabriella Roth’s sweating prayers and Bradford Keeney’s explorations of shaking medicine. Nonetheless, the subject remains problematic, especially in most professional and many public settings. I have attempted to find a place for, and yet set a limit to, ecstasy in relationship to performance in my writings on eco-shamanic actor training. So I am looking to learn something from you. Ecstasy, degrees of shamanic altered states and therapy in contemporary England and elsewhere: what can you say about it?</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-3.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>CM: I mention in my book, rather accusingly, that modern societies are the only societies where trance states are frowned upon, discouraged, sometimes even penalized. With the onset of the age of reason and enlightenment and with the development of science, we began to worship the ‘god of conscious, rational mind’, whilst neglecting, rejecting and belittling the wisdom and insights that stem from altered state experiences. But I believe that trance states are natural states, that we all have an innate longing for altered state experiences and that we haven’t done ourselves a favor by depriving ourselves of the vast reality we can access, the wisdom we can gain, the connection to the wider field in many manifestations we are capable of experiencing by altering our dimensions of awareness and perception. So, trance states, altered states, states of ecstasy, however you want to call them, are something we know very little about, whilst we know quite a lot about ‘conscious mind’, which is the least interesting, the least creative and the least influential state of mind we can be in. </p>

<p>What you said about such states being ‘problematic in most professional and many public settings’ certainly applies in the UK as well. In my book, I describe in-depth what we know about ‘altered states’ as I still find it unbelievable, often infuriating, that even in the field of therapy, these states are seldom seen as valuable. Personally, I think that it’s deliberately produced fear that keeps us ‘away from them,’ even though we all long to be ‘in them’. I say this because each new generation finds ways and means to use mind-altering substances, and as soon as a new one comes along, legislation is created to criminalize its use. Indigenous cultures, especially shamans of many creeds, in many places, use mind-altering plants to produce altered states. I personally think that as long as we are kept on the level of ‘mind’ rather than being encouraged to experience ‘expanded consciousness’, we will, collectively, restrict our development. This is not quite the place to go deeper into the subject, but just briefly one point, to illustrate this opinion: ‘mind’ is based on survival within this material reality and within this body. Mind can therefore be manipulated and controlled as it is, on a very basic level, geared up towards survival in social normalcy, reacting with fight or flight when threatened. Holistic psyche works on a different level. Through altering our state of psyche (soul) we can begin to experience the levels of connective possibilities, and begin to understand that this manifested, material reality is just one reality. We can only imagine the positive changes in thinking, behaving, attitudes and so on if we would, collectively, come to embracing this difference. </p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of Christa’s Gatherings</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> On various pages throughout your book, Christa, you write about near death experience (NDE). My next question addresses that. Do you see correlation between the constellation of shamanic dreaming, soul flight and NDE? There is, of course, what is called the “little death” of shamanic initiation; even Shakespeare draws parallels between sleep and death with Hamlet brooding on “what dreams may come.” What connections do you see here to share with Dream Network readers? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> I used the Near Death and also dismemberment experiences in my book in an attempt to convey an idea about the extreme level of ‘state altering’ that traditional, indigenous shamans are able to achieve. I also used the ND experiences to make a case for consciousness being non-local or bound by time. Only if we assume that consciousness is non-local and is able to travel outside of the confinements of our physical brain, can we begin to understand shamanic dreaming, soul flight and the idea that we are capable of accessing information from reality’s wider field, as well as creating from within this field. So the Near Death Experience is just one form of ‘state altering’--- albeit, an extreme one. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> In Faust, Goethe speaks of the Realm of the Mothers, the dark feminine, to which Faust must journey to attain wholeness. I know that the role of the feminine is important in your shamanism, psychology and ecosophy. That is Earth Wisdom. In closing, would you share something on this subject? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> Yes. But I don’t quite understand the ‘dark feminine’ yet and would rather talk about open aspects of the feminine, which we need to honor, integrate and live by. What I do understand is that long ago woman was believed to have a special, magical connection with earth, trees, plants, animals, with the rhythms of nature--- indeed with the rhythm of all life. Why? Because woman gives life, woman nurtures and sustains life, and woman is prepared to lose her own life to give birth. Woman is also patient. She incubates the seed, just as Mother Earth does. She nurtures her young for long periods. Woman is, in that sense, close to nature, to its rhythms and ways. Woman is also close to the divine, the sacred, as nature is the manifestation of the earth-sacred, of life itself. The very basic, but major aspects of the feminine principle are therefore life giving, nurturing, protecting, co-creating and giving of oneself to the young. With this, woman participates in the life of nature as ‘mother’. We are talking archetypal here and therefore we need to go back to basics. The feminine is genetically programmed towards intuiting, emotional connectedness, and communicating in a group, mainly through having and raising children. So, if we take all those basic feminine aspects and look at the world now, we realize that none of them are valued highly. The opposite is the case. Here are a few examples: we don’t nurture earth, we exploit it; we don’t communicate and connect, we use force and pressure, then go to war to dominate and to get what we want. Most of our religious systems are completely based on the masculine, with male deities and hierarchical structures created and occupied by men. Our economic systems are geared towards profit accumulation for the few, rather than communal well-being. On the whole, society belittles emotionality and intuition, preferring what is rational, male. And almost everywhere now, the evolutionary rise of the feminine brings on repressive violence against women. </p>

<p>Yet if we want to solve the earth crisis, rather than being eliminated by the earth—if we want to evolve spiritually as well as in humaneness—we need to redress this imbalance. For a long time to come, we need to focus on bringing into the fore the basic aspects of the feminine—that which is deep, life incubating, life giving, life sustaining and life nurturing. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The dream mind takes everything in. It makes pictures and stories out of more data than we consciously realize we have at our disposal. The dream mind sees everything fresh. It combines something that happened yesterday with something that happened twenty years ago to liberate an entirely novel perception. Its scope is broader because it is less focused. Perhaps we might vaguely compare the dream mind with the coarse adjustment system on a microscope and the waking mind with the high power fine adjustment apparatus. It is obvious to us that when using the microscope to best advantage we must move back and forth between the two systems. How strange that we are never trained to use our minds in this way also. The dream mind is virtually ignored by our educational system. Our waking minds are trained as if they operated alone, as if they were the only minds we had. What an interesting folly we have created. </p>

<p>This folly becomes patently evident after a while to one who works with his own dreams. Perhaps at first he sees the folly of his life as an inadequacy of his own. He is at the "Something-Is-Wrong-With-Me" stage. But after he has worked with many many dreams and filled several shelves with the dream journals, he becomes aware of himself in a different way and starts to see the world differently too. When he becomes aware of his own ignorance, he is not ignorant anymore. To the degree that he is able to realize his continuing ignorance, he becomes wise. When he can admit his total ignorance, that man is enlightened. All this is called the Creative Process by some. Others call it The Path. It is operative in every individual who has freed himself from conditioning. He is not a robot anymore. He is a human being. The only thing that can condition one such as this is the reality of the moment as he perceives it with his own ever more refined senses. He begins to see through the shallow forms of culture to its universally denied essence. For example, whereas millions adhere to the belief that the Virgin Birth was something that happened to the mother of Jesus in history, he sees that myth as a metaphor for the Creative Process each of us must go through in order to be reborn from our minds into our hearts, a higher site of intelligence. For when we are thinking with our feelings, we are thinking accurately. We discover that our feelings are our thoughts. Such complicated thoughts! We cannot easily accommodate them but if we ignore them a false kind of intelligence is born in us. Our minds can no longer think. They are stupid. They are blocking out too much data. They settle for false substitutes for the thing itself. We aren't playing with a full deck anymore. </p>

<p>A timely example is the "jihad" or Holy War of the Moslems. Today there are millions in Iran willing to slaughter their own ethnic brothers in the service of this "Holy" mission. But the Holy War is not a war between men or nations. It is a war within each of us. Its weapons are not violence and treachery but peace and love. It is the Creative Process of reowning the whole of ourselves. If we are locked up in our bodies, it means reowning our minds. If we are locked up in our minds, it means reowning our bodies. We can be locked up in our hearts too if that was the only place of refuge we had during the course of our development. What a turbulent black hole this place can be and many of us are perhaps a little psychotic. How else to explain the world we create around us? Of course, we don't see our world as psychotic. Do you think the Iranian zealot sees how crazy the order is that he serves? No, he can only see our kind of craziness, not his own. He is a blind man causing a great deal of pain and misery in the world. He is a lot like us. </p>

<p>I think it is clear that in matters of religion we are a lot like the Cargo-cultist of the Pacific Islands, going through the motions of the thing as a way to get the thing itself. We laugh at the Melanesian who makes a cardboard carton refrigerator and sits at an upturned crate "table" pretending to drink from an empty beer can in order to capture the magic that will bring him the wealth and success of the White Man. But we take our own stupid substitutes for religion just as seriously as the native takes the cardboard carton refrigerator in which he carefully replaces his rusty old beer can. </p>

<p>"O.K." I have heard some modern intellectuals say, trying to set themselves above all this stupidity, "But I am an atheist. I believe in Science. In Science we see things as they are. In Science we don't fall prey to all this foolishness. Science is Exact." Hah! How the Dream laughs every time we become exact! What pleasure it will have with us now that we think we know something! And how the Dream cries every time we turn our back on it like this, every time we sell out to a metaphor at the price of the thing itself. Let us take a look at Science, the established religion of our modern culture, and see if it is immune from the follies we inflict upon ourselves by ignoring our creative side. Anthropology is as good an example as any. </p>

<p>Let's say we live in an age of sexual suppression. Our bodies themselves dream of freedom. Let's say we are Margaret Mead. Let's say we visit Samoa. Let's say the dream in our body is liberated by the exotic surroundings. We are Anthropologists performing an exact science but do we see the Samoans or do we see what the Samoans liberate within us? Is what we are seeing not actually our own dream? One who has not worked extensively with his own dreams would object if we told him the world he sees around him with his own eyes is only his dream. But those of us who have worked ourselves in a little closer with our own dream minds have discovered over and over again that when we can own our own desires and wants and express these freely we no longer have an emotional need to misconstrue the reality we see around us. We can see things more clearly for what they are. It is only when we begin to awaken that we realize we're living a dream. New facts now come to the fore. </p>

<p>We are told now that the factual reality for Margaret Mead's reports of sexual freedom in Samoa was never there in the first place. The new facts appear to be sound. But should Margaret Mead be attacked as a bad Anthropologist? Maybe the whole thing has nothing at all to do with her. She lived in an age that longed for sexual freedom. Through her that age created a fiction that helped dispel its ignorance of itself. Through her eyes it saw in the Samoans what it needed to find in itself. I guess psychologists would call this a "projection." We see in others what we disown in ourselves. A projection is a fiction. It is something that doesn't exist "out there" but "in here." Margaret Mead gave her generation the fiction it needed to liberate itself. Gauguin was off in Tahiti, illustrating the text. </p>

<p>Our Science, like our lives, is largely a fiction. This realization is threatening to the modern intellectual who is unschooled in the ways of the dream mind. He lashes out at Margaret Mead as a bad Anthropologist. She was a good Anthropologist, but she was an Anthropologist of her time, as all others are. And among the Anthropologists of her time she was a genius. </p>

<p>What is a genius? A genius is a great artist. He may be a physicist like Einstein or a psychologist like Freud, depending on what art form he chooses. Oh how this grates against the nerve of those who need to think in categories! Their minds are in a straitjacket. Margaret Mead was a genius because she played a major role in freeing the mind of her generation from the particular straitjacket that had been imposed upon it. Should she be criticized for using Anthropology as her art form? After all, aren't all of our explorations really explorations of ourselves? Out of our body's dreams we weave art.</p>

<p>From that art we find a new reality. The sexual freedom Margaret Mead painted among the Samoans has now permeated our own culture. Like anything long buried, it has gone a little "bad" and is emerging in some strange ways. But the fresh air will shake it out a bit. It will be its old self again after a few generations, a self that it has never been able to be before, anywhere, ever. It has a freedom now it never had before. And when we begin to taste that freedom ourselves we can see why it needs to be restricted. But the difference now is that we will restrict it in our own ways, the ways that work for us, and not with the rigid formulae that are culturally imposed from a time in history when conditions were not as they are now. Margaret Mead and the other great artists of her generation set us free. The world as they saw it was a fictitious creation of their own dreams. Their dreams became our actuality. As a result, we can see the world a little differently. We can see the Samoans a little differently. Anthropology has changed because we have changed and we see things differently now.</p>

<p>I think it is in this light that we must examine the growing controversy over Kilton Stewart's Anthropology of the Senoi and the dream psychology that a number of individuals have fashioned from it. What I am proposing we do is look at the situation in reverse. Instead of imagining that we are actually finding out the truth about the Senoi finally, let us realize that the only thing we are really exploring in our studies of the Senoi is our ability to perceive the truth about ourselves. </p>

<p>I for one am not in any position to know the facts about that tribe but from the letters I have been receiving of late, which unfortunately I have been asked not to publish, I am reasonably convinced that Stewart's Anthropology can be seen now as another fiction. It hardly matters that his study was a detailed and thorough one, as several have pointed out. The issue may not be whether he was a good or a bad Anthropologist, although it seems some are trying to make it into that. The issue may merely be that the unfelt needs of his own culture and his own generation colored what he saw and reported. Anthropology once again became an art form. Anthropology once again taught us something about ourselves. How arrogant to assume it could ever teach us anything else. How presumptuous to assume that what we see and report is ever reality itself. How blind to see our Science as anything more than a reflection of our own state of conscious development. </p>

<p>If we examine Kilton Stewart's marvelous fiction as a specimen of consciousness of the society that created it, we see our own denied dreams leaping out at us. Have you ever heard of Senoi dream workshop leader expounding on how peaceful and creative the tribe is? The very tones that he uses show that he's talking about a dream he has in his own heart, a vision he has for his own society: a vision of interpersonal harmony, absence of crime and insane violence; a vision of sharing and communication between individuals in society and between those individuals and society itself that is deep and powerful and creative. Is it any wonder that Kilton Stewart's study of a remote Malaysian tribe was seized upon by so many individuals in our society? It reflects our own dream of creative freedom from the kind of bureaucratic and repressive society that results when we ignore our dreaming mind-the kind of society that poisons our very relationship with violence and sickness. How wonderful and simple it would be if we only needed to attend to our dreams to free ourselves from all this. Maybe people were only too ready to believe Kilton Stewarts study because it was true, not for the Senoi, but for us. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen what the actual facts about the Senoi are. But we can no longer deny that Kilton Stewart's Anthropology has taught us much about ourselves. It was a picture of our own future, like fiction often is; It immediately began to permeate our lives, as good art always does. The idea got out that a healed society was possible if only we would reown our own deepest dreams, the furthermost reaches of our own consciousness, the thoughtforms of our own bodies-our feelings. Maybe a few more of us now are finally ready to let go of our dead religions and our false sciences and embark, each one of us, on the Path of the great ones from Jesus to Einstein-that process of creative transformation of self and relationship that will revolutionize our world like it has never been revolutionized before. The Science of the future will become the science of the impossible as slowly we begin to take off our straitjackets and discover ourselves, each other, and the world for the first time.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>Clouds</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h3>By Charles Tomlinson</h3><!--/nopreview--></p>

<pre>

How should the dreamer, on whose slow

  Solidities fix his wandering adagio,

Seizing, bone-frail, blown

  Through the diaphanous air of their patrols,

Shadows of fanfares, grails of melting snow?

  How can he hope to hold that white

Opacity as it endures, advances,

  At a dream's length? Its strength

Confounds him with detail, his glance falls

  From ridge to ridge down the soft canyon walls.

And, fleeces as it may seem, its tones

  And touch are not the fleece of dream,

But light and body, spaced accumulation

  The mind can take its purchase on:

Cloudshapes are destinies, and they

  Charging the atmosphere of a common day,

Make it the place of confrontation where

  The dreamer wakes to the categorical call

And clear cerulean trumpet of the air.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>It is the role of the dream to wake us up to nuances and other dimensions of perception. What we can dream, we can become. The purpose of working with dreams is to bring those kinds of perceptions into our waking lives where they can confront the intellectualized, thinking-based fiction that we might otherwise settle for as our personal reality. There is something impossible about confronting the dream on any terms other than its own. And when we confront it on its own terms, our lives can't help but be transformed by its dimensions and transfused with clarity and poetry.</em></p>

<h2>untitled poem</h2>

<h3>by David Dunn</h3>

<pre>

the white necks of the swans

catch the pulse of the moonlight

thru the branches

a woman who can not sleep

in this heat

walks along the edge of a bay

or lake.

the swans drift in circles.

the woman lays in the damp grass.

she dreams of a man

that her touch

turns into a swan.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Could it be that much of psychology has it backward and that the objects of our waking joys are, as often as not, only symbolic of what we really need, not the real thing? Could it be that, in our dreams, the real thing can burst through this waking symbolism and appear for what it really is? In our dreams, we are so close to the heat of what we really feel that we can sleep no more in the slumber of sublimations and substitutions that we settle for in waking life. Our real needs are felt for what they are.</em></p>

<h2>SHAMANIC No. 3 (First Guard: Snow Leopard)</h2>

<h3>by John T Kellnhauser</h3>

<pre>

Across the mountainpeak Ellesmeres

where spring never arrives,

the glacial years' collision of continents

have carved ice cliffs

none but the most magnificently furred

can travel without falling.

Quick rosettes - silver hoar

grey between boulder shadows,

the sun ignites the snow -

painlight bursts in

to crowd the eyes from their sockets.

Some men go blind, looking.

At night there is ever

only shadow swirling,

pale whites, unfocused penumbrance

amid black and black grey.

Certain things live

to be only almost seen,

to purr "I Exist"

and leave a single clawprint's

question mark

on the snowcrags of the mind.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Is the poet writing about consciousness states or about landscapes? Or is there a modality of cognition where the two are the same and where what is seen is realized as a metaphor for what is unseen, felt? Dreamstates, powerful yet furtive like snow leopards, leave their imprints upon the snow of our waking minds, but only their imprints. Working with dreams, we can hope for more than the occasional tracks that that other creature in us leaves across our lives, we can come face to face with him, we can become something that is at once him and ourselves. We are that purring bundle of warmth and life that inhabits the frozen landscape of our waking lives and, at the same time, we are that frozen landscape also. Somehow, it is very natural for things to be like this. This is the consolation that the snow leopard teaches us and, cold and desolate as our lives become, we can always know that something alive and warm thrives in us, purring "I Exist."</em></p>

<h2>Dream of the Factory</h2>

<h3>by Alan Steinberg</h3>

<pre>

The long hair of your dreams

is tangled in the machinery

of your life.

Somewhere there is a switch

that will turn off the whole assembly,

but a metal fist holds you.

  Look now, from the corners of your

startled eyes - the spindles of thread

are spinning on their shoots, pulling

and twining the flax of your mind,

the memories spun out in little snatches

of color, the emptiness

in long stretches of white or gray. Already

you have lost the knowledge of words

lost even the reflex of screaming.

Now your legs would not support you,

nor would your hands remember

the direction of your face.

</pre>

<pre>

Only when the shuttles of the great loom

lurch into action

are you released to consciousness

upon the bed - the metallic grating

still vibrating through your bones.

You stare at the ceiling in the dark

sweating

What are they weaving there, in the big room?

For a moment you think of silk gowns,

of Persian carpets and flame-yellow shawls.

But no, no - somewhere sack cloth

is being jerked from bolts

and stitched,

and the brush of floating lint

reminds you of life

but only for a moment.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Why is it that we are not, most of us, fully conscious in dreams without awakening? Why is it that perhaps 95% of the population are not lucid dreamers? Could it be because, if we were, we would interfere with the dream too much? Could it be that what we would weave for ourselves with mental interpretations is gunny sack cloth when compared to the Persian carpet that some other agency within us, or working through us, is destined to arrive at? What is being woven in dreams is not just our own lives but the destiny of the human race. What is being fabricated in our dreams is something larger and more intricately beautiful than any of us could ever possibly be aware that we are a part of. Our lives are so much more impoverished than our possibilities. But the dream keeps moving, generation by generation, to the surface. It knows its own time, and it knows its time will come. It is the living bud. Our theories and ideas are the dry scales that fall from it.</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Bob Trowbridge</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><em>Those who know Bob Trowbridge tend to see him as an easygoing teddy bear of a man with a quick wit and strong sense of humor as well as a warm and accepting nature. His insight and wisdom make him a popular speaker and dreamworker.</em></p>

<p>Until dreamwork came along I didn't have much direction in my life. I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I told people I wanted to be a bum; but not poor. When I went before a committee of ministers and laypeople to determine my readiness to enter seminary and the ministry, someone asked me why I wanted to become a minister. I said, "It beats getting an honest job." </p>

<p>I have had life-long dream recall, went through a period of pretty impressive nightmares (witches) and have had spontaneous lucid dreams at least since young adulthood. In high school I read a lot of religious material and in college plenty for my psychology degree. It was all grist for the mill but didn't make my direction really clear. </p>

<p>In 1976, while reading something from Edgar Cayce, I had this incredible mental explosion of very high energy that stayed with me for weeks. I was reading his ideas on the physiology of dreams and I started making all these connections between different dream ideas that were floating around in my head. I wrote down about a dozen theories pertaining to the electrical/chemical aspect of dreaming. </p>

<p>At about the same time, I began reading Seth's ideas about dreams, and it was like coming home. I kept having little precognitive dreams about the material I would read in Seth the next day. </p>

<h2>VOICE OF A DREAM EXPERT</h2>

<p>While walking down the street in San Rafael, I heard a voice in my head say, "You're an expert on dreams." Now that was a totally foreign thought to me - something I did not rationally believe to be true. I knew a lot about dreams and was working with my own, but certainly did not consider myself to be an expert. But that thought, added to the energy I was experiencing, gave me the impetus to put a flyer together and offer a dream class. I had never even taken a dream class! I got two people to sign up, padded the class with friends and launched my dreamworker career. </p>

<p>Then I heard a woman on the radio being interviewed about Seth so I wrote the station and suggested that they have a program on dreams and that I be the guest. I thought I might hear from them in a couple of months or never. I sent the letter on Friday. On Monday I had an upset stomachache that continued into Tuesday. I couldn't find any explanation for the queasiness and generalized anxiety I was feeling. Wednesday morning the station called, said they had a cancellation and could I come on the show that night? That was precognitive anxiety!</p>

<p>There I was in the middle of my first dream class with my friends and I go on the radio as a dream expert! Well, I was absolutely calm, professional and brilliant on the show. I didn't even use my notes. From that point on, whenever the interviewer, Don Chamberlin, wanted a dream person on his show, it was me. Every four to six weeks I'd go on for one to three hours and take calls from people about their dreams. It was very popular. Then the newspaper got interested and I was interviewed twice within my first year of dreamwork. </p>

<p>I came to dreamwork with a kind of ignorance and innocence which was a real boon to me because I didn't have a preconceived notion of what was or wasn't possible. I just did things and people picked up how simple it was. </p>

<p>Nowadays I do visualization work which is very powerful. It's a way for people to bring up symbols on the spot - a waking dream. I lead a channeling group, do regression workshops and with Steve Marks offer seminars for nurses under the banner of Healing Arts Associates. </p>

<p>I have been editing The Men's Journal for the past three years and, of course, have recently taken on editing <em>DNB</em> with Linda. I had always been a loner and done things on my own. Now I'm really enjoying connecting with people through these publications and through my involvement with the Bay Area Dreamworkers Network. It's great to learn about so many different and exciting methods of dreamwork! </p>

<h2>WAKING UP TO THE POSITIVE</h2>

<p>I usually do my own dreamwork and meditation while walking, since I get restless trying to sit still. </p>

<p>My feeling about the significance of dreams is that there are two things that need to happen for us to move into our fullest selves. One is dream lucidity and the other is waking lucidity. Dream lucidity or out-of-body experiences, states that I think are very similar, mean more consciously creating what we want and confronting the things that stand in our way. Lucidity in the waking state means bringing our dreaming consciousness into our waking life. It is tantalizingly possible that some of the things we're capable of accomplishing in the dream state could be accomplished in the waking state - if we are lucid. It means waking up to who we are. </p>

<p>Dream lucidity and OBEs allow us to explore just about anything that we want. We can use lucidity to talk to our dream guides face to face. We can explore the past to see if there are places where our energy is blocked. We can explore the future to check out probabilities and choose which ones we would like to activate. We can simply use the dream state to try to move into our own most positive selves, to generate and embrace our positive images. We are willing to look at the negative images in our dreams and struggle with and confront our shadows, but we are less willing to accept positive images as parts of ourselves. Part of dreamwork in the future is to pay attention to the positive images in dreams. They are there to stretch and expand us, to expose us to our greater selves. </p>

<p>My goal is to close that gap between who I am able to act out at this point and who I really am and know myself to be. I realize that there is a cleansing and a healing involved and an incredible letting go of past and future. And I must die to my old self in order to move into that new self, all of which is scary. I had a dream about this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My spirit guide, Doug (don't laugh; I know of one named Ted), is wearing a suit, looking successful and driving a big dark Cadillac convertible. The road goes to a wire mesh fence and beyond into a vineyard. But there is no gate. Doug just magically drives through the fence. I walk up to it intending to pass through as well. But I bump into the fence. There are two families, one good and one bad. The father of the good family explains to me that Doug is a Wizard which is why he can drive through. I reply, sadly, "I'm a Wizard too."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <em>am</em> a Wizard, and I am a Wizard after the fashion of the Wizard of Oz. And what is the significance of the Wizard of Oz? He was a humbug, a phony.

<p></a></p>

<p>I have been searching for a new career. As various offers have come my way, I incubate a dream to see if this is the correct job opportunity for me to pursue. </p>

<p>On one occasion, I dreamt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I saw a set of dice about to be tossed. They had rhinestones or diamonds where the black dots should be.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I interpreted this to mean that the job was a gamble, or a toss of the die. It could be lucrative, but it was a definite risk. I did not pursue this job offer. </p>

<p>On another occasion, I dreamt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I were both working for the company that had offered me a position. We had to sign up to volunteer work at a marathon. My husband was more enthusiastic about volunteering than I was.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I interpreted this to mean that the job would be a long haul with very little income. I chose to pass on the offer. </p>

<p>During this past June I came upon an opportunity to run my own business. The more I explored the concept, the more excited I became. It seemed that I had at last found the correct occupation that would make use of my talents. The dream I had to clarify the pursuit of this occupation was as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I see a very handsome young man walking toward me in the hall of the college that I attend in the dream. I wish that I could somehow meet him and have lunch with him because I am powerfully attracted to him. Obviously he feels that same way when he sees me because he turns around in the hall and approaches me. We carry on a conversation. I tell him I'm a senior and he indicates that he is a freshman transfer student. He should be a sophomore, but he lost credits when he transferred. I wonder if I'll be teased about him being younger than I am. Later on, he shows up at the dorm room I share with a learning disabilities teacher. He and I kiss passionately, and I'm hooked!</em></p>
  
  <p><em>We are now in a bed making love and I'm wondering why me breasts aren't as aroused as they usually are during passionate love-making. This is my first sense that maybe this relationship isn't all that it's supposed to be... Even though I'm extremely aroused and passionately involved.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>The scene changes. We're in a car and he stops to buy some drugs. The police pull us over. The like him because of his easy manner and good looks. He is let off the hook with a warning. Meanwhile, the whole time we're in the car, I'm still passionately aroused and desperately want a climax but never achieve one.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<p>I interpreted this dream to mean that though the job was seductive and I was passionately exploring this as an occupation, it had the possibility of some real problems for me in the future (actually drugs could easily be hidden and transported in this business). It also indicated that I would be left without fulfilment, the climax I so desperately wanted in the dream. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Dreamers inspired by poets—poets inspiring and guiding Dreamers. One particular poet and one particular Dreamer come together on a joint venture of mutual interest and the result is Robert Moss’s <em>The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead: A Soul Traveler’s Guide to Death, Dying and the Other Side</em>. Divided into three distinct and interconnected sections, The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead offers what could very well be the beginnings of a much needed Book of the Dead for the Western (industrialized) world. </p>

<p>Two of Moss’s strongest points are that Imagination is a necessary and vital element of the afterlife—and—dreaming is our most direct access to learning about and preparing for life after physical death. But Western culture tends to view Imagination with the same suspicious and disapproving eye it uses on dreams/dreaming. Consequently, our understanding of the afterlife is vague, incomplete, and constricted. Both the dead and the living in Western culture suffer from a lack of information. This book endeavors to provide some practical tools and guidelines to “help us heal our relationship with death and dying.” It is a relationship sorely in need of healing. The first section, <em>Dreaming with the Departed</em>, draws on dreams and tales of the afterlife from other cultures as well as contemporary dream reports. While reminiscent of Patricia Garfield’s <em>The Dream Messenger</em>, Moss offers an expanded view of this type of dream. He explores not just the common themes and messages in such dreams but also lays a foundation for deeper and more conscious dialogues/interactions between living and dead. Yes, the dead visit us in our world, via dreams, but we visit them in their world as well, gaining our own glimpses into the bardos beyond. There is a process, a path, a pattern to the afterlife, and different kinds of energy and consciousness survive physical death. Sometimes the dead need help from the living. Many don’t know they have died, for instance, or we hold them too close or too long and they remain earthbound longer than they might have otherwise, or they don’t know (because of beliefs held during physical life) that they <strong>can</strong> go on. Dreaming of the dead is part of the dying/death/healing process for both the living and the dead and Moss offers specific suggestions for the living which assist both living and dead – not just ‘feel good’ rituals, but practical matters such as sudden or violent deaths, unburied/missing bodies, the dense energy body of the ‘stuck’ dead, entanglement with this denser energy, etc.. Moss reiterates the necessity of imagination in the afterlife (“…lack of imagination is one of the main reasons people get stuck on the other side of death”). It is the key to a deeper dialogue between the living and dead, and a necessary element in a Western Book of the Dead. Ultimately, Western culture benefits from a more active and conscious communion with the other side of the veil. </p>

<p>If <em>The Dreamers Book of the Dead</em> stopped after Part One, it would still be a valuable addition to any dreamworker’s library. It doesn’t stop, of course, but continues with an exploration of The Poet as Guide to the Other Side. Here, Moss describes his interactions with and guidance by the spirit of W. B. Yeats, an early Twentieth Century poet whose own efforts at writing a Western Book of the Dead resulted in <em>A Vision</em> (1925 &amp; 1937). He learns more about the afterlife through a variety of experiences (dreaming, shamanic drumming/journeying, travels to and visits from others who had died, etc.), with Yeats as his guide much as Virgil was Dante’s guide. There are numerous references to other individuals and groups who have traveled this path in earlier times (the Victorian era, for example). This section provides much of the larger context which ties the other two sections together. Throughout the whole of the book, as well, are poems and stories from other cultures which further bring us from where we are to where we could be in our own culture’s relationship to death and dying. </p>

<p>Dreaming the Way from Death to Birth is where we are headed in finally creating a Western Book of the Dead. Here are tools and guidance to help us truly begin to heal that relationship with death/dying. By learning (and helping others learn) how to prepare/maintain our personal ‘houses of death’, we can be ready when it is our turn. Stories from many dreamers and many traditions, as well as descriptions of Moss’s own experiences and what he has learned, make up much of this section. Several short meditations are offered as examples to help in visualizing different ways of starting on your journey after death. A brief summary of common ‘steps’ found on the other side is also given, though individual experience will, of course, be shaped by one’s own beliefs and expectations about what is on the other side. Reincarnation is touched on as well, as are some other ‘non-western’ concepts (being alive in more than one time period at once, for example). </p>

<p>At the end of his book, Moss offers additional resources, provides a description of his Dream Re-entry technique (most helpful in further exploring those dreams with the dead), and presents a very extensive bibliography with authors both ancient and modern and in a variety of fields (including Garfield’s Dream Messager). This may not be the final incarnation of a Western Book of the Dead, but The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead a really nice start. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zchaot-0.jpg" alt="Krippner in Brazil"></p>

<p>A myth can be described in many ways but the metaphor of a "chaotic attractor" is especially suitable. In chaos theory, there are several types of "attractors" but a "chaotic attractor" finds order in what appears to be incomprehensible data by helping us to discern an underlying pattern. In much the same way, a myth can organize a constellation of beliefs, images, emotions, motives, and values that can, in turn, bring order and direction to a society, an institution, a family, a person, or to an entire culture. From a psychological perspective, a myth is an imaginative narrative (usually expressed in words but sometimes expressed in dance, images, etc.) that addresses existential human concerns, and that has behavioral consequences. Myths are more imaginative (more accurately, "imaginal") than empirical, and this is where a mythic narrative differs from an empirical scientific narrative. Empirical science, despite its successes in explaining the workings of natural phenomena, is virtually incapable of fulfilling the other functions that myth has provided over . the millennia - assisting the passage of individuals through the life cycle with rituals and ceremonies (e.g. ways in which myths are "performed"), identifying a person's place in the social world of work, love, and play, as well as helping him or her to link with the world of spirit, of the "ground of being," or of ultimate value.</p>

<p>This essay will use these perspectives on myth (one covert, one overt) to present, for the first time, a particular transcription of a portion of oral mythology. We were honored to be allowed to record these stories during a trip to Salvador, Bahia, Brazil in 1997 where Cau Trigo, a young Brazilian man working with the Kariri Xuco tribe introduced us to Tinze, the "Nhenti" or "Keeper of the Traditions."</p>

<h2>The History of the Tribe</h2>

<p>The Kariri Xuco' are a coastal tribe in the Brazilian northeast (Novaes da Mota, 1987). In the 13th and 14th centuries, the warriors of the Tupi tribe pushed the Kariri Xuco' from most of their coastal land into the interior. They now live along the west side of the San Francisco River, the second largest in Brazil, after the Amazon, with which it does not connect. Hydroelectric projects interfere with the tribe's water supply, badly needed for fishing and irrigation. Only 10% of the land they presently occupy is now legally owned by the tribe itself, the remaining property being subject to state and federal regulation and utilization.</p>

<p>This process of losing control of the land and, therefore, their destiny, began during the days of colonization. The Portuguese made slaves of the Tupi Indians, and the European historians called them the first people of the coast, not knowing that the Tupi had supplanted the Kariri Xuco' before the Portuguese arrived. It took a century for the Portuguese to locate the Kariri Xuco'. With the advent of colonization, the federation of northeast Indian groups disintegrated. The Kariri Xuco', whose culture had not recovered from their ejection from a coastal area to a dryer river area, were further destabilized by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>There were bloody skirmishes between the Indians and the colonizers. Hoping to reduce expenditures on war, the Portuguese brought Capuchin priests from France as well as Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to pacify the region. This plan succeeded but resulted in the loss of much of the Kariri Xuco' culture.</p>

<h2>Personal History of Tinze</h2>

<p>Tinze told us that he had always had an interest in the myths of his tribe. But when a child attempts to listen to the tales told by tribal elders, the custom is to tell the child to go away. Only a child with determination will respond by saying that he or she wants to stay and listen. Tinze was one of these children. In addition, he often pretended to be asleep while the elders were telling stories. He still remembers the state of consciousness he fell into during those hours- a mixture of relaxation induced by having his eyes closed, alertness needed to hear the stories, and fear of being discovered.</p>

<p>Over the years, Tinze gradually won the confidence of his elders. Little by little, he was given tasks and responsibilities. As he was successful in each of his missions, he gained more access to the stories along with new responsibilities.</p>

<p>In his early 30s at the time of our interview, Tinze told us, "From the time I was a child, I have been interested in tribal stories, and eventually I committed myself to the recovery of the Kariri Xuco' culture. I could see how a revival of these stories could stop the loss of our culture. Once I had attained sufficient wisdom, the elders listened to my ideas to reconnect members of our tribe with the spirits, with nature, and with each other." Now Tinze is the tribe's "Nheneti" or "Keeper of Traditions." This position involves secretarial work, representing the tribe to the outside world, communicating with tribal counselors and heads of families, as well as with the tribe's chief and shaman.</p>

<p>Tinze told us that such responsibilities are not common for a person as young as he is, but that the tribal leaders admired his devotion to the ways of the ancestors and his skill in harmonizing and mediating conflict within the tribe. Shortly before our interview, Tinze was honored to receive a secondhand typewriter for use in his official duties.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Myths</h2>

<p>The Kariri Xuco' believe that each river contains several "Maes do Rio" or "mothers of the river." These spirits live in the river and must be respected because of their power. Dedzu's is one of these spirits and resides in a portion of the Rio San Francisco -the San Francisco River- which originates in the state of Minais Gerais, eventually flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Kariri Xuco' fishermen try to win favor from Dedzu's because if she likes them, they will always bring home fish, and their catch will surpass that of others who have not won her affections. Indeed, some fishermen give Dedzu's so many presents - delicious foods, beautiful flowers, perfumed herbs - that their wives become jealous and see Dedzu's as a rival. But if a fisherman does not abide by Dedzu's wishes, he will catch fewer fish. And if he ignores or insults her, he is at risk for having his soul stolen. Dedzu's domain is filled with stolen souls who work as slaves to do her bidding, including going on expeditions to steal other souls. The loss of one's soul is a terrible tragedy, far worse than losing one's life.</p>

<p>Dedzu's is a spirit of the night. At midnight, she comes out of the water and visits the riverbank, where she eats the corn and beans left for her as well as putting the gifts of flowers in her hair and the perfumed herbs on her body. When surprised by a human being, she jumps back into the river and the intruder might hear a splash of water.</p>

<p>Dedzu's powers are activated by the disappearance of the sun's rays. On occasion she will allow herself to be seen by one of the fishermen she favors. Her body is beautiful but translucent; she is human in form but has gills on her neck. She wears no clothes but her long hair flows over her body. These fishermen can stroke her body and engage in intimate conversation with her, but like other Kariri Xuco' spirits, she does not engage in sexual activity with humans. She is capable of having children, however, her pregnancy sometimes being evoked by the intimacy she shares with one of the fishermen. She can become very jealous of other "Maes do Rio" and envious of the wives and girlfriends of her favored fishermen.</p>

<p>When Tinze was in his early 20s, he was accustomed to returning home with a fine catch of fish, frequently bringing back more than the other fishermen. Still, he followed the advice of his mother, who told him, "When you are fishing, be careful to avoid the river spirits. Take care not to fish too much in one place or the River Mother may entrap you." Tinze's mother suspected something of which he was unaware: the River Mother was preparing him for an intimate relationship.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Tinze began to have girlfriends and the Water Mother grew jealous. For the first time, Tinze returned to the village at the end of the day without any fish. He tired easily and spent much of his time sleeping. His friends thought that he was ill, but his mother suspected that the River Mother was trying to steal his soul. Indeed, this suspicion was confirmed in the dreams that Tinze's mother had at night about the River Mother, who accused her of being overly protective of Tinze. One way in which Tinze's mother protected him was to put a small piece of tobacco over the door of the house and also in his shorts, because this sacred plant has the power to neutralize malevolent activities of the water spirits, and of other invisible forces as well. Tobacco represents the benevolent spirits who can protect human beings from invisible forces that are negative, especially those that result in soul loss. Tinze's mother was successful and her son recovered from his weakened condition.</p>

<p>Another group of water spirits are the "Pretus do Rio," or the "Dark Ones of the River." One of the most powerful is Irotzu, another spirit of the night. Often, he stands at the river bank observing the fishermen. When a fisherman least expects it, Irotzu dives into the water; a splash is heard but nothing is seen. Yet the fishermen know that Irotzu is nearby and monitors their work carefully. They know that Irotzu will punish them if they fish during the time when fish eggs are hatching. They know that they must fish only when necessary, and must use only natural methods of fishing. For example, some men toss small bombs into the river and collect the fish that float to the surface. They are subject to the wrath of Irotzu, and if they try to protect themselves with tobacco, Irotzu will go after one of their immediate family members.</p>

<p>Women of the Kariri Xuco' tribe can fish as well as men. One of Tinze's cousins had been fishing for a long time with no success. Finally, in frustration, she called out to the river spirits, "Stop joking and give me some fish." Such a statement was disrespectful, of course. She immediately felt dizzy and almost fell out of the boat. Her sister caught her and rowed back to shore. Eventually, the transgressing woman regained consciousness, but her eyes burned badly. Her brother told her that her head looked as if it had been hit by a bow."</p>

<p>A healing session was initiated, which successfully aided the woman's recovery. The Healing God's full name is sacred and can never be mentioned in public. However, there are many healing spirits to whom prayers can be offered directly.</p>

<p>The religion of the Kariri Xuco' is syncretic. Since the time of the missionaries, members of the tribe have entered into relationships with Christian Saints through their prayers and public rituals. As Tinze remarked, "We love Jesus Christ and admire Mother Mary, but we retain our ancestors' religion as well."</p>

<p>A third water spirit is "Cabe a Grande" or "Big Head," a name applied collectively to a group of invisible children who play in the river. These spirits have heads that are disproportionate in size to the rest of their bodies. Their antics can be observed when there is a rush of white water, a sudden eddy, or an unexpected phenomenon. Tinze told us, "One day I saw a stream of water flowing against the current and knew that Big Head was being playful."</p>

<p>These spirit children do not interfere with human affairs. However, fishermen must be aware of their behavior or their boats might get caught in the rapids that develop when Big Head is making sport.</p>

<h2>Placing of Myths Within Our Perspective</h2>

<p>The narratives provided by Tinze illustrate our descriptive model of myths. On an overt level, these stories are imaginative narratives that address such important human issues as family relationships, food supply, and matters of health and safety. The narratives impact behavior, giving instructions as to how fishing must be done, how the spirits must be pacified, how souls must be protected, and how sickness must be treated.</p>

<p>On a covert level, these myths can be said to "attract" beliefs (tobacco will protect someone from malevolent spirit activity), emotions (parental concern for the souls of their children), images (the description of the Water Mother with her gifts and long hair), motivation (bringing home a fine catch of fish is so important that one is motivated to respect the water spirits), and values (the loss of one's soul is the ultimate disaster).</p>

<p>The utility of our descriptive model can be demonstrated with the myths of the Kariri Xuco'. But it can also identify mythic elements in other imaginal narratives. Fairy tales are told for entertainment, but often include moral lessons. Legends tell of semi-historical feats of heroism but frequently refer to a culture's values. Sagas are compilations of legendary accounts but the motives of their characters are frequently clear.</p>

<p>Even so, imaginal narratives that deal with superficial issues and do not contain behavioral implications lack the qualities that would qualify them as myths. In a world where chaos seems to be on the increase, the underlying attractor provided by myths can provide a sense of order to individuals as well as institutions, families as well as societies, and perhaps even to cultural revivals as we observed in Tinze' s accounts of the Kariri Xuco'.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Carl Jung prophesized that the only chance our civilization has for avoiding nuclear holocaust is if enough individuals can stand the tension of opposites in themselves (Hannah, 1981, p.8); if we can, effectively, take responsibility for our dreams and inner lives. To most people living in our extraverted, materialistic father-culture<sup>1</sup> such a notion may sound strange, mad, or simply irrelevant. What powers can we find in our dreams which could help us overcome the dark momentum generated by military and political superstructures - those forces which "wield the powers of darkest hell and shake the land"? (Pearne, 1970) </p>

<p>Before we write off Jung's vision as out-of-touch wishful thinking, let us stay open to the possibility that he may be absolutely right: that taking responsibility for our dreams and our tension toward wholeness moves us in the direction of integration, healing, and a sense of universal connectedness and sacrality. Conversely, repression or denial of our dreamworlds (along with its psychic analogue--the devaluation and invalidation of the feminine universe) moves us toward isolation, fragmentation, devitalization, and violence born of impotence and estrangement. </p>

<p>In writing this article I am responding to a cluster of dream experiences which have been acting upon me for some time. Like water on stone, they have sculpted within me a shape of experience, a set of concerns. These concerns center around my coming to understand the nature of the collective consciousness which seems to be impelling us toward nuclear confrontation. By 'collective consciousness' I am referring to our 'official' story, our authorized, consensual understanding of ourselves and our world. It is the ground of our self justification. It is our collective reality frame which structures our modes of perception and which screens out data which is non-congruent with, or injurious toward, our official reality. It is very difficult to step outside of this frame of reference, yet it seems vital that we find ways of doing so if we hope to restructure the course of world events toward the preservation of our planet. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is only through a change of consciousness that the world will be 'saved'. Everyone must begin with himself. Political action, social work, this 'ism', that 'ology', are incomplete, futile actions unless accompanied by a new and elevated mode of awareness... the true revolution is revelation (White, 1972, p.ix).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe our dreams provide a powerful vehicle of revelation in helping us differentiate from the prevailing collective consciousness. </p>

<p>This paper represents an extended meditation on Jung's prophesy and a sharing of dreams, some personal revelations, which seem to speak to our present political situation. Since dreaming happens within a cultural context, I would like to place my dream experience within this context: I am living in a country which until fairly recently was inhabited and tended primarily by dream cultures who had cultivated dream realities to a degree that we can barely comprehend from our mythically impoverished and nature-depleted viewpoint and experience. In the attempt to systematically destroy these cultures our 'patriarchal culture of conquest' has destroyed much of our inner grounding as well as our capacity for tending and preserving the natural world. I hope to sketch for you the nature of dream consciousness among the Native cultures of this country and trace the loss of this dream grounding after the arrival of white colonizers. This loss involves the oppression of a worldview - a condition of the heart - which we must recover to some degree if we hope to regain our balance with the natural world. It is my hope that we may yet recover sacred ground - inner and outer - which Jung saw as the only hope for our survival.</p>

<h2>Dream Sharing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every dream must come from a place where that dream is true. -Brothers of the Grape</p>

<p><em>I am writing a book. The first line appears to me: "The red moon hung suspended in the black jungle sky."</em></p>

<p>Several months later I am reading Nor Hall: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are times when only scattered individuals feel the imperative of change and times when the sights of a people are shaped by fear of the end of life as they know it. In such emergency times, symbolized by the reddening of the moon and blackening of the sun (Acts 2), lives take on another charge (1980, p.167). </p>

<p><em>There is fear of war in everyone. I meet an old man who is especially tuned-in to war energy. We're on the easternmost edge of the U.S. The beach we play on will be destroyed if war comes. The old man who intuits war is dying. His wife is heartbroken. I hear my daughters playing and laughing in the depths of grandmother's house. They are in rooms beneath the basement. Outside: endless expanse of cornfields. Now I am watching a plane with U.S. as its logo fly very high in steep, rapid ascent. When it reaches its zenith it stalls and crashes to earth in flames.

I am in a board meeting with the principal and and inner circle of loyal staff including the principal's brother who runs the reactor. I feel totally out of place here. I'm on a dangerous mission. I need to confront and sabotage the power structure. It's a big lie. The meeting is a patriarchal gathering. After the meeting a few people are invited to dinner with the principal. He calls them "the larger majority." I say jokingly, "I'm not fat enough to belong to the larger group." I have to pass as one of them, but I must subvert them and their nuclear danger. I see expensive desks; I see small children of affluent parents. In spite of their wealth, they're going to be exposed to radiation. It's a crooked, rigged game. Now I'm at one end of a large pipe or tunnel. A large ball of string is run through the pipe at high velocity. I'm to catch it. I'm a workman on this project. I catch it and hold it in place (like a plumb line run horizontally.) A group of people start doing a ritual dance along the string. It's a mechanical, zombie, dead energy movement. I see that the spiritual, artistic, and connective energy is dead here. I have an impulse to do a live-energy dance. I see myself dancing with one of the dead-people with my passion, humor, and consciousness wide open. I know I'd be found out, seen as different, suspicious, dangerous to the social order. I know I'd be harmed. Now I'm writing with an orange and white ball point pen which has come from inside the nuclear reactor. I realize I'm contaminated. It's weird: I can't see or feel it, but I'm in a death field of radiation. I still have to complete my mission: confront the patriarchal nuclear power structure by telling the truth.</em> </p>

<h2>The Dream Crier</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lakota still believe firmly in the efficacy of the vision quest, a ritual fasting and sacrifice through which contact is made with the dream world and the spirit selves of the other realm. -Arthur Amiotte, "Our Other Selves" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the arrival of European explorers and colonizers, what we now call America was inhabited by land and water based dream cultures who had lived here 30,000 years or more and who had developed over 2,000 languages and major dialects - more than existed in Europe and Asia combined at that time (Georgakas, 1973,p.ix). While the cultural diversity of these peoples was enormous, the common thread which characterized their worldviews was a deep respect for and identification with the sacrality of all life. All life-forms (in both the waking and dreaming states of existence) shared equal validity, equal ontological weighting. The prevailing spiritual aesthetic was roundness and union with all life energies. Black Elk, an Oglala Sioux holy man, tells us: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles and everything tries to be round (McLuhan, 1971, p.42). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no distancing nor disidentification with the natural world which characterizes our times and culture.<sup>2</sup> There existed a profound sensitivity to the interconnectedness of all creation: everything moved in circles, all was relative (and relatives) to all else. The psychic and physical ecologies of these peoples were in a state of balance and harmony (which early explorers saw as a state of grace). Every living being-- including life and energy forms which we no longer have the power to see, which we have invalidated in our time--was respected for its consciousness, its sacred energy, which the Iroquois called <em>orenda</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dreams were the main contact between <em>orenda</em> and human understanding. Individuals fasted and prayed in hope of obtaining visions, although an unsought vision was the most valuable. The shamans, who were a combination of doctor and priest, were expected to dream often and to know more than most mortals about the wishes of spirits. In mid-winter a dream festival was held to strengthen <em>teharonhiawagon</em> (the Master of Life) (Georgakas, 1973, p.4). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lakota Sioux called this sacred energy or intentionality, <em>sicun</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All things possess a special power of their own which can be added to, expanded, and utilized to help others and themselves (Amiotte, 1982, p.30).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams and visions were, functionally, the place of sacred energy exchange and infusion among beings, and especially beings from spirit-planes of existence. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zditna-0.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>Tribes such as the Iroquois, Sioux, and Mojave were respected as very powerful dreamers and visionaries. Most of the important daily decision making was premised on dream wisdom and guidance. By midlife, many people could not distinguish between wisdom and experiences gained from the waking world or the dream world (Margolin, 1981, p.117). There existed a seamless union of the two hemispheres of experience. An early explorer and Jesuit priest, Father Jean de Brebeuf, describes (albeit in a condescending manner) the central importance of dreams in the lives of the Hurons: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dream is the oracle that these poor Peoples consult and listen to, the Prophet which predicts to them future events, the Cassandra which warns them of misfortunes that threaten them, the usual Physician in their sickness, the Esculapius and Galen of the whole Country-the most absolute master they have. If a Captain speaks one way and a dream another, the Captain might shout his head off in vain - the dream is first obeyed... The dream often presides in their councils; traffic, fishing, and hunting are undertaken usually under its sanction... They hold nothing so precious that they would not readily deprive themselves of it for the sake of a dream... It prescribes their feasts, their dances, their songs, their games - in a word, the dream does everything and is in truth the principal God of the Hurons (Vogel, 1982, p.21). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This level of dream consciousness was evolved over thousands and ten thousands of years of dream cultivation. In describing the elegance and structure of Mojave dreams, Margolin writes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dreams like this are possible only among a people for whom dreaming was more than a random and uncontrolled activity of the mind; for whom it was an important and well-cultivated art (1981, p.116). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Margolin further notes that in his study of Native Californians, he found that most Native autobiographies</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gave no details about the birth, marriage, or occupation, but instead consisted of meticulous recountings of dreams and contacts with the spirit world (1981, p.7). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams yield energy-wisdom-truths to the degree that they are cultivated and well received by the dreamer and the culture. Dreaming happens within a cultural context, a worldview, a reality frame. Native cultures and worldviews were woven from dream realities and important dreams were ritually offered to the community where they could be reintegrated into the mythic fabric. A balanced and harmonious relationship with the natural world found its essence and source in the balanced relationship with dream and spirit worlds.<sup>3</sup> In dreams one came to understand the essential connected-sacred nature of all Being and beings. One came into contact with the spirit world and found access to the many planes of existence, from the underworld to the sky world. </p>

<p>Traditionally, the shaman was the strong dreamer. Eliade (1974) calls the shaman the "Technician of the sacred". The shaman's role is to maintain balance for the community and the world by harmonizing him or herself in sacred, ecstatic ways. The shaman has reliable and inspired access to 'big dreams'; the space Jung terms "archetypal" and the time which Eliade calls "illud tempus". The shaman induces ecstatically in him or herself effective and healing reversions to original, cosmogonic time and space - the ground of creation, transformation, and reconstitution. Not only shamans, but each person had access to spirit-visions through his or her dreaming. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every man can cry for a vision, or 'lament': and in the old days we all-men and women-'lamented' all the time (Black Elk, 1971, p.44). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary pipe woman Evelyn Eaton (Mahad'yumi) tells us: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father Sky is the place dreams come from. Over-all the Sky is the power of the Vision and for people on earth the power comes through dreams (1982, p.162). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Native cultures dreaming was not a passive, up.controlled activity; rather, it was approached with the utmost care, preparation, and sacred intention. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term <em>Hanbleceya</em> is usually translated as "crying for a dream". A deeper meaning hidden in the word's roots suggests a standing and enduring. The <em>ceya</em> - crying or suffering-indicates a need for sacrifice... In the process of sacrifice, <em>sacer facere</em>, to make sacred, one is ritually denying the physical existence of the mundane world in order to reach into or experience the sacred world (Amiotte, 1982, p.30). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The degree of humility required for dream 'lamenting' or crying is in proportion to the degree of power one might receive in the vision-dream. Black Elk tells us that we must make ourselves "lower than even the smallest ant" (1971, p.54); that we must realize our own individuality is nothing in relation to the powers of the Great Spirit if we are to prepare successfully for a dream crying. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the chosen day arrives, the young man wears only his buffalo robe, breech cloth, and moccasins, and he goes with his pipe to the tipi of the holy man. Crying as he walks, he enters the lodge and places his right hand on the head of the holy man, saying: "Unshe ma la ye!" (Be merciful to me!) He then lays the pipe in front of the holy man and asks for his help (Black Elk, 1971, p.44). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sacred dream was sought for the good of all people and all life. The dream crier's humility and vulnerability aligned him or her with a sacred mode of awareness and allowed receptivity to the higher good. The dream crier served as a channel for sacred:mythic revelation and spirit-guidance. </p>

<p>The powers for healing, prophesy, spirit travel, and sacred education which Native peoples suffered toward in their dream cryings are relegated by our scientific worldview into the categories of magic, superstition, and paranormal phenomena. These are not highly validated categories of experience in our patriarchal worldview. It is significant that these powers were considered normal and natural by Native peoples. Only in a hypertrophied rational culture are dream and vision potentialities seen as super- or para-normal. They fall outside (or perhaps survive on the border line) of our consensual reality frame. In Native cultures, these powers did not fall outside of natural law; in fact, dream-vision-spirit realms provided grounding and ordering energies for a worldview based on the deep-wisdom perspective of nature. We could say that Native cultures experienced dreaming within a sacred:mythic context. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This capacity of the Native mind to sustain the mythological presence of the transparent world, to integrate sacred time and geography with ordinary time and space, gives rise to a unique view of self in relation to all things and others, including those who dwell in the sacred or 'spirit' world, or as the Australian Natives call it, the "dreaming" (Amiotte, 1982, p.27).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The individual dreamer offered important dreams back to the community where they could serve the common good and renew the mythic ground. Failure to bring important dreams back to the community might result in various forms of what we would call psychogenic illness, or even death. It was recognized that the structure and power of dream reality was much larger than our limited conscious reality, and that a large dream of common import, if kept inside the individual, could cause serious harm. The dream:myth cycle was so vital that "a song or myth was not considered known until it had been properly dreamed" (Margolin, 1981, p.116). Conversely, a dream might reveal a song or mythic insight which would have to be ritually enacted, shaped, and dreamed on by the community. Jung has advised modem Westerners to "dream the myth onward", knowing that myths, like any living thing, are subject to disintegration and decay if not properly tended and inspirited. Native cultures understood their responsibility for tending myths through dream cryings and vision quests. In turn, the myths (the important, collective dreams) nourished and informed the individual's dreams and infused the dreamer with sacred energies - <em>orenda</em>. This was the state of dream consciousness in this country, Turtle Island, when the first white colonizers reached its shores.</p>

Let it be measured and counted. <em>-Ronald Laing, The Politics of Experience</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When early colonizers reached this land they were often greeted by tribal elders who wept in ritual thanks-giving for a safe delivery. When Columbus reached the shores of the Bahamas (which he mistook for India and accordingly misnamed the Natives 'Indians') he was greeted by Arawak men and women who swam out to meet him. Columbus notes in his journal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things... they willingly traded everything they owned... They do not bear arms and do not know them... They would make fine servants... With fifty men we could subjugate them and make them do whatever we want (Zinn, 1980, p.1). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first explorers found this land in pristine condition and many believed they had discovered the Garden of Eden or Paradise. Columbus, and the majority of colonizers and slave traders following his example, responded to these gentle and generous people with programs of unbelievable cruelty. Las Casas, a Spanish priest who sailed with Columbus, describes the treatment of the Native people and the land when gold mining was initiated by the conquerers: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... mountains are stripped from top to bottom to top a thousand times ... Thus husbands and wives were together only once every 8 or 10 months and when they met were so exhausted and depressed on both sides... they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them... 7000 children died in 3 months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation... In this way, husbands died in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk and in a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile... was depopulated... My eyes have seen acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write this... (Zinn, 1980, p.6, 7). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zinn assesses Columbus' damage: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In two years, through murder, mutilation, or suicide, half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead. When it became clear that there was no gold left, the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates known as <em>encomiendas</em>. There they were worked at a ferocious pace and died by the thousands. By the year 1515, there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left. By 1550, there were five hundred. A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island (1980, p.4,5). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This atrocity was to play itself over and over again in the course of white expansionism into Native lands, and the desecration of sacred lands and the oppression of Native peoples continue down to this day. Dan Katchongva and other Hopi elders sent (then) President Richard Nixon a letter in 1970. It read, in part: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The white man, through his insensitivity to the way of Nature, has desecrated the face of Mother Earth. The white man's advanced technological capacity has occurred as a result of his lack of regard for the spiritual path and for the way of all living things. The white man's desire for material possessions and power has blinded him to the pain he has caused Mother Earth by his quest for what he calls natural resources... It is said by the Great Spirit that if a gourd of ashes is dropped upon the Earth, that many men will die and that the end of this way of life is near at hand. We interpret this as the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We do not want to see this happen to any place or any nation again... (1973, p.i). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of psychic and spiritual attitude, how does Columbus' genocidal course of action differ from our current leader's plans to 'win' a nuclear war in which millions of people would die instantly while the rest die painfully in an irredeemably devastated world? I would argue that much of the sickness and moral blindness which enables a people to envision, build, and deploy weapons which could destroy all life is an extension of a certain orientation, an archetypal reality frame. This dominant in our collective consciousness has influenced our actions and historical perceptions from Columbus through Vietnam and continues down to our present course of flirtation with 'limited nuclear fights' to be staged on European soil. When asked how we could 'win' a nuclear war, Vice-President Bush replied: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have a survivability of command in control, a survivability of industrial potential, protection of a percentage of your citizens, and you have the capacity to inflict more damage on your opposition than they can inflict on you ... Reporter: You mean like 5% would survive? 2%?... Bush: More than that. If everyone fired everything he had, you'd have more than that survive (cited in Rogers, 1982, p.10). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edwin Meese, advisor to the President, in a speech of March 1, 1982, defined all-out nuclear war as "something less than desirable" (cited in Rogers, 1982, p.10). If the Native worldview is characterized by a deep respect for the sacrality of all life-forms and the preservation of Mother Earth, how do we characterize the worldview of a culture which supports such spokesmen? </p>

<p>I believe we need to recognize which archetypal determinant we are perceiving and acting from as a culture if we are to take steps to bring consciousness to our situation and balance our deep-psyches (individually and collectively) toward life-affirmation. The dominant impulse in Native cultures was toward the preservation of sacred life, and the dominant psychic orientation came from the crying for dreams and visions. The polarity of this worldview - which the white colonizers introduced to this land - is dominated psychically by the archetype of the "unbroken male" (Campbell, 1964). This archetypal dominant constellates a worldview which supports and is supported by male dominance, aggression, and control. In a patriarchal culture, each person, to a greater or lesser degree, participates in upholding and preserving this archetypal force field. The unbroken male is psychically the polar opposite of the shaman or dream crier. The shaman is characterized by his or her initiation through psychic dissolution, dismemberment, and death. It is in this state of brokenness or woundedness that healing dreams and visions visit the initiate and teach powerful lessons from spirit-healing realms. The shaman is the wounded healer who, in turn, heals from his or her own wounds. The unbroken male upholds an attitude of invulnerability, psychic and emotional encasement, and dominance over the environment. The unbroken male will not surrender nor suffer toward feminine wisdom. He does not cry nor lament. </p>

<p>We can describe the shape of consciousness of people living within this archetypal field of experience as extraverted, lacking in-sight, competitive, materialistic, techno-rational, paternalistic-senile, disconnected, exploitative, spiritually depleted, oriented toward accumulation and social power, and violently hostile and repressive toward feminine, nourishing, and internal energies. The unbroken male devalues the Mother, the Earth, dreams, visionary activities, and wisdom of the heart and soul. He molds his body experience around a barrel-chested heart and military spine. Yielding and surrender are seen as signs of weakness and defeat. He equates power with dominance-over rather than sharing-with. Freedom is equated with control. He would like to experience the freedom of total control. He believes in objectivity and that numbers and logic are value-neutral. </p>

<p>His formal way of seeing - the scientific method - is premised on the principles of prediction and control. His psychology measures behavior and excludes 'inner' experience from its formal realm of study. He believes it is possible to have a perception which is not ethically bound to the 'observer'. The 'subjective', felt, dancing world is seen as inferior, heretical, or invalid. Dreams are non-sensical, im-material, foolish. Myth means falsehood. The unbroken male identifies with his machines and with linear progress. He is disconnected from his natural environment. He kills from a distance and his distance kills emotionally. His mode of perceiving the feminine universe is ontological invalidation: trees are seen as timber. The world is drained of divine energy and purpose. He likes to 'cause' submission in others. In his weakened and abstracted state of consciousness he might feel a certain gratification if he were to destroy all life on the planet: he would experience the freedom of total control. If 95% of his people were destroyed in the process, he would still experience a victory of numbers, a survivability of control. </p>

<p>When we look at the world through the eyes of the unbroken male, we see a devitalized, dis-spirited field of objects and numbers which may or may not suit his needs. His "desire-energy" (Bly, 1980) cannot get beyond his own encasement; he cannot connect empathically and compassionately with the natural world, the shared world. This lack of connection may be necessary to maintain his sense of control and dominance, but it also generates a deep impotence, and inability to make any nurturative difference. There seems to be a critical threshold where this gnawing sense of impotence gives rise to violent strikings-out at the world: feeble attempts to make some difference, to make even a fatal connection. The unbroken male is a psychic timebomb. In his refusal to break, surrender or be wounded into openness he breaks everyone and everything in his world. The unbroken male is the 'larger majority' in my dream of nuclear danger. His game is rigged and the children are at stake. lIe is a "false father" (Bly, 1978); his rational insanity is a lie. He upholds a dead-energy mode of existence. He "trembles in fear at the sight of love in the smallest child, the slightest smile, the open hand" (Pearne, 1970). This is the archetypal energy field the white 'conquerers' brought to this land. This is our psychic inheritance. </p>

<p>The final psychological breaking of the dream cultures occurred at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1890 when U.S. government troops slaughtered an encampment of Sioux Ghost Dancers. Black Elk describes the situation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I, to whom so great a vision was given in my youth - you see now a pitiful old man who has done nothing, for the nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead. (Georgakas, 1973, p.112). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the historical context of the breaking of the Sioux Nation, Black Elk is describing the breaking of psychic and spiritual wholeness; the desecration of a world in which the dream and vision mediated sacred energy exchanges of nature and spirit. Without mythic:sacred:dream grounding to inform and vitalize our lives and culture, we lose connection with the natural world and with Spirit. We are left stranded with no deeply cohesive or binding meaning or purpose. We are psychically 'out of place'. If we no longer experience our dreams and inner beings as carriers of sacred intention, then we have also lost our capacity for experiencing and engaging the natural world in a healing and inspirited way. The Earth is no longer protected as our Sacred Mother, we do not listen to stones as they strive toward roundness, protective spirits and guardians of sacred sites depart, unheeded and uncared for. </p>

<p>People cannot live for long without a center, without an adequate experience of sacred meaning or infusion of sacred energies in their lives. Profane existence, as Eliade (1959) points out, is historically bound, while sacred existence is atemporal and participates in cyclical "eternal returns" to sacred time and space. Profane existence lacks sacred intentionality, a celestial archetype, or mythologem within which people can order their lives in a meaningful way. Profane life lacks authentic center, and it can provide no access to origins or sacred grounding. Our current patriarchal, militaristic, senex-culture cannot help us participate deeply in our own being; rather, it orients us toward material gain, exploitation of others and of 'natural resources'. and ego aggression and dominance. This mode of existence is lived from the head, the 'reptile brain', and it keeps us paranoid and bricked-in. In our father-culture the linear-rational is hypertrophied at the expense of the numinous, the warm-blooded connective. The culture of the unbroken male is sedimented in profane existence and will, necessarily, come to an historical end. The Hopi and other native prophesies have foreseen the destruction of profane life and the resurrection of sacred life (the return of the Buffalo). D.H. Lawrence, profoundly touched by the Tewa culture of Taos, New Mexico, shared that vision: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there it is: the newest democracy ousting the oldest religion! And once the oldest religion is ousted, one feels that democracy and all its paraphernalia will collapse, and the oldest religion, which comes down to us from man's pre-war days, will start again... This is an interregnum (cited in Wood, 1976, p.12). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On December 16, 1982 a group of Hopi Elders addressed the U.N. General Assembly "to present the revelations of the Hopi Prophesies and the need for peaceable cooperation and acknowledgement of the importance of dreaming and the inner life on a world-wide basis" (Taylor, 1982). The people of the dream have not lost their vital connection with the sacred intention of our world. If we are able, individually and as a culture, to humble ourselves, to find the courage to allow our shame to transform us into compassionate and insightful beings, and to bring sacred intentionality to our worlds--inner and outer-then we may help bring about the preservation of life. The Hopi Elders tell us we must affirm the importance of dreams on a world-wide basis in order to help with this healing. In this way we may help nurture back to life a fresh shoot from the sacred tree of life.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In cultivating our dreamworlds, we turn away from our social masks and our official daytime stories about ourselves and our times. In. turning away from our pretences and shallowness, we generally encounter elements and images of our dark, unknown selves. The tension of opposites which Jung refers to is our ability to recognize and integrate our own darkness, evil, inferiority, and woundedness. This acceptance moves us toward humility, compassion, and forgiveness.on a personal and planetary level. Jung has said that in the projection of our shadow upon the world, we turn the world into a replica of our unseen face. Traditionally, we have projected our shadow selves onto other people, races, cultures, and countries. This is the psychological basis for our ontologically invalidating our enemies: the 'enemy' is our unknown, feared, and hated self. In our emptying our enemies of divine energy and human qualities, we deplete ourselves spiritually and psychically. In killing our enemies we kill the redemptive potential of our own wholeness. Once we have projected 'enemies', it follows that we must destroy them before they can destroy or contaminate our righteous and limited ego-perceptions.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>The beauty of consciousness is that it strives toward integration rather than disintegration. Becoming conscious of our shadow selves by listening to and believing our dreams, puts us in a healing and integrative relationship with our depths, our own souls. To withstand the tension of opposites in ourselves is to re-collect our unconscious, disintegrative projections from the world. In claiming our shadows we also open ourselves to the redemptive light which shines from the darkness, or as Roethke tells it, "The Redeemer comes a dark way." Our shadow, once acknowledged and embraced, brings healing and transformative energies into our lives. In coming to know our dreams we also gain insight into the nature of our collective, cultural shadow. We are granted glimpses of our cultural blind spots and memory-lapses. We come to view our history from the perspectives of the oppressed, forgotten, and disenfranchised. Conversely, when we see and act from our collective shadow, we lose spirit, we make enemies, and finally we destroy others and ourselves rather than break the encasement of our false identities. Jung came to see the collective, cultural shadow of white civilization while visiting the Taos Pueblo in the 1920s: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What we from our point of view call colonization, missions to the heathen, spread of civilization, etc., has another face--the face of a bird of prey seeking with cruel intentness for distant quarry--a face worthy of a race of pirates or highwaymen. All the eagles and other predatory creatures that adorn our coats of arms seen to me apt psychological representations of our true nature (1965, p.248). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The healing, therapeutic value of a person's coming to accept and transform shadow energies is the sine qua non of depth psychology. In the same way we must accept our collective cultural shadow if we are to transform that energy and evolve toward humility and forgiveness on a planetary level. Dreams reveal to us a more complete picture of who we really are. They challenge our fixed perceptions and expand our psychic and spiritual possibilities. </p>

<p>To take responsibility for our dreams is to claim deeply internal authority for our perceptions and actions. By consciously participating in our own dream development and in sharing other people's dreams, we begin to individuate from the perceptual field of the prevailing cultural consciousness. We begin to contact our deeper truths, our soul-truths, and we are shown the mythic patterns which shape our contemporary fields of experience. Campbell (1968) tells us that the mythogenic zone in our present culture must be the individual heart, and Jung and the archetypalists describe the work of depth psychology as "soulmaking". When we recover our dreamworlds to any degree, we recover our capacity for an ensouled and heartful way of life. We recover a ground of compassionate wisdom. When we begin to take our dreams seriously--to let them be as real as they know themselves to be-we begin to participate in a sacred way of seeing. We come into vital, connected relationship with images or spirits who possess their own consciousness and purpose and who bring to us life-sustaining wisdom and empowerment. </p>

<p>The world of dreams is cyclical, spiralling, and round. Our dreams move us toward our mandalic selves. As we move toward wholeness, we identify ourselves as "circles whose center is everywhere; whose circumference is nowhere" (Jung, 1965, p.398). In this movement toward psychic roundness we differentiate from our linear-progressive culture. Dreaming is the psychic balm for our Cartesian wounds. </p>

<p>The recovery of our dreamworlds puts us in attunement with sacred, unbroken energy, and with renewal and hope. The dreamer is the hope-bearer, the gift-bringer. Through our dreams we come to see what is most intimate, significant, and true in ourselves and our culture. Perhaps through our recovery of psychic and spirit dimensions of dreaming we will make warm-blooded connection with deep sources of affirmation, energy, and wisdom rather than continuing our suicidal disconnection with the natural world. </p>

<p>The roots of dreams go deep - beyond our rational understanding or belief systems. World attitudes, like individual attitudes, change only through arational experience: conversion, illumination, revelation, grace. While it is vitally important to initiate and cultivate rational discourse and policy making concerning the nuclear threat, I believe it is equally important for each of us to tap into primal levels of life-desire if we are to reaffirm and revision our future on this planet. We must look 'way down deep' - make ecstatic contact with our oldest and wisest selves - if we hope to free ourselves from the dark momentum of our times and restore the broken hoop to wholeness.</p>

<li><p>This culture transcends national boundaries and represents a reality frame or mode of consciousness which is characterized by estrangement from and hostility towards the natural world. Starhawk describes this consciousness: "Its roots lie in the Bronze Age shift from matrifocal, Earthcentered cultures, whose religions centered around the Goddess and the gods embodied in nature, to patriarchal, urban cultures of conquest, whose gods inspired and supported war" (1982, p.174). </p></li>
<li><p>This sickness of distancing or disconnection constellates an aesthetic of I-it. This generates an attitude of ontological invalidation and psychic and physical violence toward the natural world and natural law. </p></li>
<li><p>Dream and spirit worlds were not 'metaphors' nor 'prescientific' and therefore inadequate understandings of the physical or psychological world; rather, they were ontologically real and vital beyond our current imaginings. </p></li>
<li><p>Shadow projection is, paradoxically, our most dangerous enemy. We see a frightening example of this problem on a national scale in Reagan's recent replacement of the Arms Control and Disarmament Director with an outspoken critic of detente. This led to fear and demoralization within the relatively conservative agency. According to one Foreign Relations Committee member: "Ken (Adelman) sees the Russians as the personification of evil itself, and it's very hard, if you have that view, to negotiate with them" (Denver Post, January 16, 1983, p.19a).</p></li>

<p>I am going to begin with a parable.</p>

<p>In the current era dreams have come to us as a psychiatric heritage. Mention the word "dream" and two names come to mind, Freud and Jung. In the unique home Freud built for our dream life, the energy source came in the form of the personal unconscious and was located in the basement. Jung came along a bit later and built a quite different style home with a dual energy system in the form of both a personal and a genetically determined collective unconscious. Besides, it was not hidden in the basement but was built into the very obvious facade of the house. These two geniuses took us quite far in explaining the healing potential of the dream. Freud's instinctual theory has been extensively remodeled over time in the direction of a more adaptational model. Jung's home for the dream is still pretty much the way he built it. Both homes provided shelter to people who were in need of it.</p>

<p>Two problems emerged from this architectural parable of our dreams. Both homes were available only to those who mastered the two very different metapsychological keys to the front door. Thus did our dream life become institutionalized. Mastery of design (theory) and maintenance (technique) were essential for those who sought to live there. What was necessary but strange about this was that it became more like a hospital setting rather than a normal home. Dreaming is a universal feature of our existence serving a natural healing function and as such should be universally available. The fact that dreams deal with our emotional life does not relieve us from our individual responsibility to make the best possible use of them. Of course if our emotional life gets too askew we need more than our dreams to regain our balance. By way of analogy, babies came into the world before there were obstetricians. Midwives often sufficed. If there is danger to the mother it's good to have an obstetrician nearby. We are all midwives to the dreamer in group dream work.</p>

<p>The professionalization of our dream life left the public to flounder in its ignorance until fairly recently. In the recent decades professionals and laity joined together to stimulate the public's interest in and knowledge about dreams and how to work with them. The message was that everyone had the energy source to manage their own dream house. Not enough such homes have been built but compared to the situation that existed for most of the last century, there has been a relative real estate boom. Many years ago a book appeared, "Mr. Dowling Builds His Dream House." That's something every human being on this planet can do and perhaps someday will. Only in the last thirty years has a concerted effort been made to return dreams to the people who dream. There are two lessons to be learned from this. Dreams are as helpful to us to the same extent as any other bodily system. The second is that analytic theory is a limited container for our dreams.</p>

<p>Dreaming is characteristic of all mammals. Just as each of our bodily systems serve as maintenance and repair, so do dreams. Their task is to deal with the changing scene in the way we live out our lives. Awake we have a range of authentic and unauthentic emotional responses. Asleep and dreaming we each have an incorruptible core of being that confronts us with who we are rather than who we think we are. It ferrets out the truth as current emotional residues surface in their link to our past (when relevant) in an effort to alert us to predicaments that vary from the mundane to the momentous, from joy to tragedy.</p>

<p>We are better off for discovering the truth about ourselves in any of the four dimensions of our life. In the biological dimension dreams remind us of bodily needs. On occasion, organ pathology appears in a dream before waking awareness. In the psychological dimensions, where most of the subject matter of our dreams comes from, we explore our vices and our virtues. In the social dimension there is both negative and positive fallout from the various "isms" that are swept into our unconscious like sexism, racism, ageism and I might add dreamism, a derogatory attitude toward dreams, prejudging them from the point of view of the waking state as silly, unimportant, or meaningless.</p>

<p>There is a fourth dimension that has no generally agreed upon designation, e.g. transpersonal, cosmic, spiritual. This has to do with the many unanswered questions about our place in a universe not of our own creation. Religion has attempted to fill in this gap but has not had a good track record in uniting us as the single species that we are.</p>

<p>Despite the advances in our psychological study of dreams and the current experimental and observational studies, there are many unanswered questions about the nature of dreaming consciousness. Here are a few of them.</p>

<p><em>Where does the inexorable honesty of our dreams come from? It is as if we have a magic camera with an ethical aperture that opens wider while dreaming than in the waking state.</em></p>

<p><em>What is the source of the creativity that shapes very original imagistic metaphors in our dreams that embed our true feelings and do so in a way that is oblivious of time, space and causality?</em></p>

<p><em>What is it that so instantaneously links our remote past memories in their relevance to the current source of feelings that instigated the dream, something we can't do consciously?</em></p>

<p><em>Where do the occasional "big" dreams come from that Jung referred to with imagery that evoke feelings far beyond our ordinary range?</em></p>

<p><em>Why do paranormal events such as telepathy occur more often in dreams than in waking life?</em></p>

<p><em>Why are we more acutely aware of all four dimensions of our life while dreaming than awake?</em></p>

<p>In seeking answers to these questions I have sought help beyond my own field of psychiatry. The last ten years of the twentieth century was known as the "decade of consciousness." Quantum physicists, in concert with many other disciplines, began to focus on "the hard problem" (Chalmers, 1995), namely, the connection of consciousness to its underlying neurophysiological substrate. With only few exceptions, however (Wolf, 1994; Walker, 2000; Eccles, 1953), the focus was exclusively on waking consciousness. Quantum theory was so successful in the light it shed on all its applications to the world of matter, perhaps it could bring us closer to an understanding of the relationship of mind to matter. The problem was that no one understood the strange features that came with it. These included its indeterminism, the wave-particle duality, the jump an electron makes in going from one orbit to another without being in between, the measurement problem where all aspects of the experiment including the observer influence on the end result, and finally the reality of the impossible, namely non-locality, where a signal goes faster than light.</p>

<p>There was something about these puzzling features of quantum theory that suggested an analogy to the nature of dreaming consciousness. My comments will be limited to complementarity, the contextual linkage of the observer and the observed, non-locality and interconnectedness.</p>

<h2>Complementarity</h2>

<p>Bohr (1961) sounded a clarion call when he wrote of the relevance of the general concept of complementarity to quantum mechanics and how it might apply to disciplines other than physics, including the life sciences and the mind itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The use of apparently contrasting attributes referring to equally important aspects of the human mind present indeed a remarkable analogy to the situation in atomic physics, where complementary phenomena for their definition require different elementary concepts. (p. 77)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not know what an electron is when it is not being measured. What we do know is that it has a dual nature depending on how we go about measuring it. Under one set of circumstances it becomes manifest as a particle. Under another set of circumstances it appears as a wave. This hidden unity of opposites is known as complementarity. It is also an apt term to describe the dual nature of consciousness. Awake we are in the particle mode facing a world of discrete objects. Asleep and dreaming we are coping with the internal resonant wave-like feelings seeking to embed themselves in symbolic imagery. Both states, while experienced in qualitatively different ways, are derivative of a unity. They are complementary. Both are necessary for a complete description of the individual. To the extent that one is in focus the other is not.</p>

<p>More specifically, the two different forms of consciousness reflect the unique and paradoxical predicament we are in. We are one with the material fabric of the world and at the same time capable of observing that world, reflecting on it and interacting with it. Awake we function in a world characterized by its discreteness and patterning. Asleep and dreaming we shift to a more diffuse imagistic portrayal of residual feeling tones. Awake, the feeling tones that later surface in dreaming consciousness are dimly felt in a manner akin to a Greek chorus. The latter registers the background dissonance between a particular conscious response to a given experience and the seeming unawareness of its actual felt impact. Asleep and dreaming there is a figure-ground reversal highlighting the feelings involved while the waking ego is assigned to a more reactive role.</p>

<h2>The Observer and the Observed</h2>

<p>Quantum mechanics has brought to the fore the interrelatedness of the observer to the phenomena under observation. This is known as the "measurement problem" and is still a very mysterious aspect of quantum theory. We become, as Wheeler has noted, participatory observers in the world around us. The quantum features of an experiment are determined by all the aspects of the experiment including input from the observer in determining the end-result. There is something quite analogous to this when we are dreaming. Awake our observing egos, taking our discreteness as a given, interact in ways that are at times coherent with the underlying reality of our situation and at times are not. By this I mean we are either emotionally engaged or not. Asleep and dreaming there is a radical shift in the observer role. The reality that now comes into view is spontaneous and unsummoned. We remain an observer but are now observing a scenario not of our own conscious making. It is as if the dreamer experiences herself at the onset of a dream as a member of an audience in a theater witnessing a drama about to ensue as the curtain goes up. She has no awareness that she herself has written the drama about to unfold, cast the characters, arranged the props, and reacts to what is going on on the stage as a novel experience.</p>

<p>There is, in effect, an actual merging of the observer and the observed as the dream context unfolds. Freed of temporal and spatial constraints, having a causality of its own, the feeling residues of the waking context come into full view in a metaphorical narrative. By changing our focus asleep we change the "measurement" arrangement and arrive at different views of a unitary entity.</p>

<h2>Non-Locality</h2>

<p>The term non-locality refers to the instantaneous transfer of a signal from one place to another through no known physical means. Non-locality at the quantum level has been subject to experimental proof but still remains a baffling mystery. Non-locality at the macro-level, as cited in dreams, has been supported by the experimental work in parapsychology and also remains a quite mysterious happening. Whether we are catching glimpses of one mystery or two different ones remains to be determined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My own interest in telepathy began in the course of psychoanalytic practice when a patient of mine would report a dream containing striking and non-inferential information of concordant events in my own life. This eventually led to experimentally controlled studies using the REM sleep-monitoring technique resulting in statistically significant findings with regard to both the occurrence of telepathic and precognitive dreaming (Ullman, Krippner, Vaughan, 2002).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do strange things with time and space in our dreams as we impress them into metaphorical service. In the case of time the instantaneous condensation of past and present might be looked upon as a kind of subjective non-locality. The paranormal dream, on the other hand, suggests the possibility of an objective non-locality by spanning across space in the telepathic dream and across time in the precognitive dream. The information picked up is literally or symbolically depicted in the dream. At an anecdotal level Louisa E. Rhine (1961) noted that dreaming seems to favor the occurrence of telepathy over waking consciousness.</p>

<h2>Interconnectedness</h2>

<p>Here there are three strands that seem to fit together, if only by analogy. The first is the assumption that quantum connectedness applies to the universe as a whole. This view has gained support with the experimental proof of the general acceptance of non-locality as a basic feature of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The second is the view of Barlow (1980) who wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Consciousness is not a property of a brain in isolation but is a property of a brain that is and has been in communication with other brains.... I shall suggest that consciousness ... is Nature's method of making humans behave cooperatively."</em> (p. 82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies and I believe correctly that consciousness, awake or dreaming, is contextual in nature and that we lose sight of this in our assumption that it is our unique gift to do with as we want. Awake the capacity to love is the most coherent way of relating to a given context. When that capacity is impaired, efforts at healing are set in motion in a way similar to the efforts at repair when a bodily system is damaged in any way. It is in this sense also that dreaming consciousness as a natural healing system exposes impediments to connectedness and explores the coping resources available. Just as we are not in control of our own natural healing potential in response to trauma, infection or other sources of impairment, dreaming is an unconscious effort at healing in the realm of feelings, biologically enforced and spontaneously set in motion. Dreams shed light on unresolved tensions and in so doing pave the way to a truer sense of connection to one's past and to others in the present. Awake we are the beneficiaries of a biological adaptive mechanism that arose in connection with sleep. Once dream content became oriented to social existence in the human sense, the value of that content found its way into waking life. A prime example is the way preliterate societies have made use of their dreams (Eggan, 1949).</p>

<h2>Towards a New Abode</h2>

<p>What kind of a home is needed for that very special entity known as the dream? As the parable continues, the needs of that occupant are briefly summarized.</p>

<ol>

<li>The dream needs an abode that is safe, warm and supportive regardless of the emotional weather outside where we encounter the occasional "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."

</li>

<li>Like all our organ systems, it is a functional system operating in its own way. In this sense it is part of an extended family that at times visits this house because of functional needs such as the need to urinate. In a recent dream of mine I was building my own water supply system. I caught on and managed to get to the bathroom in time. There are times when a particular organ gets into trouble and it may move into the dreamer's house until recognized and the needed help arrives.

</li>

<li>In this new house there has to be sufficient space to accommodate the special furnishings of the dreamer. These include the following:

Creativity: Dreaming, in a sense, is a very personal art form. Our waking life is full of dead metaphors. "Full" is used metaphorically as its concrete meaning has to do with volume. "Dead" is used as a metaphor as its ordinary reference is to actual death (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Dreams, as the major occupant of the house, spend a good part of the night churning out brand new metaphors.

<p>

<b><i>Memory:</i></b> The dream has the key that opens up our remote memory bank and links relevant memory to its role in the dream. Waking consciousness does not have the key. The dream connects us to the personal past and orients us to the social future.

</p>

<p>

<b><i>Imagination:</i></b> This is a remarkable aspect of the dream that is called upon for the manufacture of metaphors. It is the source of their uniqueness.

</p>

<p>

<b><i>Honesty:</i></b>This is the most important tool the dreamer has. It is concerned with house maintenance and repairs. It does this by ferreting out flaws in the structure. Honesty connects. Dishonesty disconnects. Life is full of traps for the unwary that lead at times to expediency instead of authenticity.<sup>1</sup>

</p>

</li>

<li>The dream has an extended family who also inhabit the abode and contribute toward its maintenance. They come from different regions already noted -- the biological, the psychological, the social and the fourth or cosmic dimension.

</li>

</ol>

<p>The parable ends here.</p>

<p>The new abode owes its origins to the work of a distinguished theoretical physicist, the late David Bohm. I want to say in advance I cannot, in this presentation, do justice to the range and depth of his argument in setting forth a new theory of the nature and origin of matter. Nor can I ask him to shoulder any responsibility to the way I have applied it to the origin of our dreams. In my personal meetings and in his writings, he has never, as far as I know, referred to dreams or dreaming.</p>

<p>My interest in the possible relevance of quantum theory to dreaming was awakened in 1974 when I had the good fortune of attending a week long dialogue between David Bohm and Krishnamurti. Twenty-three years before this meeting Bohm wrote what was and still is a classic text on quantum theory. There was an interesting sequel to this book. He wrote it to deepen his own understanding of quantum mechanics but instead it left him with the feeling that a major shift in perspective was needed to go beyond the mysterious gaps in the then and still current Copenhagen indeterministic view of quantum theory. His scientific curiosity was also fueled by his sensitivity to and deep concern with the level of fragmentation that exists among the peoples of this earth and the precarious state we have arrived at in our current efforts of civilizing ourselves. Encouraged by Einstein and Pauli, Bohm began to move in two directions at the same time. He developed an algebra to resolve the anomalies of quantum theory and a metaphysics that addressed the origin of matter and ultimately the source of the generalized fragmentation (Bohm, 1980). Bohm posed the need for a new order to supersede quantum theory just as the latter superseded, but included, the Newtonian order.</p>

<p>Bohm set forth a fundamental order, the implicate order, an order of wholeness that included all that exists and does so in a state of interconnectedness. It is structured holographically, the entirety manifest at every point. Bohm preferred the term holomovement to emphasize that it is a generative order in flux. This order of what he refers to as enfolded wholeness is not only the source but also the maintenance of all that exists. All matter unfolds out of the implicate order to form the explicate or unfolded order in a continuous equilibrium of enfoldment and unfoldment.</p>

<p>The contents of the implicate order no longer exist as discrete elements. They retain their individuality but not in the form experienced in waking life. They exist in a form that reflects their intimate contact with the whole. An analogy would be of a flowing stream where all the fundamental elements of the stream are in contact with all others. There is a continuous and sustaining exchange between these two orders. All matter in this sense is regarded by Bohm as temporary abstractions from the implicate order. He cites as an example of this what is known as a standing wave. In a flowing body of water interacting eddies may throw up a wave that appears to be stationary but exists only as long as the eddies support it. In a sense we are all standing waves existing as apparent entities that sooner or later fall back into the underlying matrix, the implicate order from which we came.</p>

<p>What now follows is an exploration of the possible relevance of Bohm's work to a deeper understanding of the nature of dreaming.</p>

<p>In the beginning there was Freud. Whether you agree with his metapsychology or not, he realized the importance of an unconscious domain that made itself felt mainly through our dreams. Then came Jung along with a broad interest in other fields such as psychic phenomena and quantum physics. He enlarged the unconscious to include inherited archetypes. We now had a collective unconscious in addition to a personal one. The unconscious was safely ensconced in the new profession of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>Then came Bohm who worked out an overarching metaphysics that addressed the basic issue of wholeness and fragmentation. What I am focussing on from the point of view of dreaming is that in the implicate order all matter, inorganic, organic, sentient, exist in their interconnectivity. If we were to consider the implicate order as a Universal Unconscious, what would it contribute to our understanding of the nature of dreaming? Broadening the unconscious in this way extends dreaming to a much wider range of content than we usually consider. Dreams point outward<sup>2</sup> as well as inward. This would include events usually considered outside the range of our dreams such as the cataclysms of nature as well as telepathic and precognitive dreams. In short, Bohm's implicate order, considered as a Universal Unconscious, links us more authentically not only to ourselves but to all forms of matter.</p>

<p>Just as we described standing waves as formed and maintained by an invisible energy source giving it the appearance of permanence, so are we. We are all standing waves existing as temporary entities that sooner or later fall back into the underlying matrix, the implicate order from which we came. Just as standing waves can be buffeted about in the ocean by outside forces that may impinge upon it, we are buffeted about by social and material forces that impact us. Depending on the nature of those forces they can deepen or limit that sense of connectivity with others and with our environment that is our heritage from the implicate order. To the extent we honor that gift of connectivity to others and to our environment we end up as either saints or sinners or somewhere in between. At one extreme is that rare occurrence of cosmic consciousness where the individual feels profoundly connected to all that exists if for only a fleeting moment. It is as if the individual catches a glimpse of the implicate order while in the explicate order.</p>

<p>Bohm's approach to wholeness in the framework of the implicate and explicate orders suggests a more felicitous appreciation of the role our dreams play in our life. Dreaming consciousness is situated between the two orders. As such it could be considered as a relay-station with input from both orders. The contributions from the implicate order would include the capacity to open up our remote memory bank, the freedom from space and time, contiguity based on feelings rather than the logic of waking life, the wide range of imagination and memory, a prevailing quality of truthfulness and finally the creative energy of the implicate order (Bohm refers to it as generativity) prepare this remarkable brew for the dreamer.</p>

<p>The dream acts as a relay station receiving input from both orders. What does it need from the explicate order? Dream content itself is triggered by recent residual feelings that have been stirred up and not yet resolved. Those feelings include what Freud referred to as the day residue. I prefer to include a larger time span which I refer to as enduring emotional residues that evolved over days or even weeks before the dream. What the dream needs from the implicate order are the remote memory sources of the current issues and the creative dynamic that characterizes the holomovement. The feeling tones then find their way into the dream.</p>

<p>As a relay station between the two orders dreaming enriches both Bohmian orders. It makes its own unique contribution to the implicate order, just as any other experience does and it makes its contribution to the explicate order by infusing it with a bit more honesty and authenticity. The dream presents a fresh supply of authentic feelings, the true source of our connective tissue. Inauthentic feelings maintain disconnection. Authentic feelings do not let our ego get in the way. They serve to save ourselves from ourselves when we need to.</p>

<p>Dreaming consciousness thus integrates input from the implicate order making it available to the explicate order. In its unfoldment from the implicate order it may be regarded as explicate to that order. As it, in turn, unfolds its message to the explicate order it may be regarded as implicate to that order. This form of consciousness has its own unique language made up of feelings embedded in metaphorical imagery and arranged in narrative form. In its development differs from the logical causality of waking life in that it evolves by feelings generated by the successive transformations of the metaphorical imagery. This projectory follows a dialectic path much as a playwright hints at the theme in the first act followed by a second act which develops the source of the tensions initiated, followed by a third act, conveying the way the tensions have been resolved. For the dreamer the extent to which the tensions are resolved are, of course, dependent on the inner resources available at the time they are occurring.</p>

<p>The dream is a creature of the night and may or may not readily find its place in the explicate order. If interested, we find that place in our own way. It's in the order of a dream, if remembered, for the dream to be socialized to fully communicate what it has to say. The form this socialization has taken, and properly so, is the experiential dream group. Such groups have been organized in various ways. My own groups are atheoretic, following the dream as the only guide necessary to fully disclose the dreamer's predicament at the time it occurred. Eschewing a priori theoretical formulations the members of the group, including the leader, are all midwives creating the conditions for the safe delivery of the dreamer's own personal creation -- the dream. Self-disclosure is the analogy to labor pains prior to the end result justifies the means. The baby's first cry gets a new life going; the dreamer's "aha" has the same effect. The dream has found its rightful place in the world.</p>

<p>We do have to learn a new language to reap these benefits but that is not so bad. We all learned the language of metaphors in grade school when we committed our first poem to memory. The poet rearranges words to express feelings. The dreamer rearranges imagery to tell a story.</p>

<p>I began with a parable and I'm going to end with one. The dreamer who lives in this new abode gets up in the morning, leaves his new abode and goes to work with his dream safely ensconced in his briefcase. His workplace is a very unusual building. It's a building in progress. It is a skyscraper<sup>3</sup> with no roof leaving room for a limitless supply of additional "stories." The interior is also unusual. There are no private offices for CEO's, managers, etc. There are only large rooms which can accommodate a small group. The chairs are arranged in a circle. One briefcase is opened and dream work begins in a process controlled by the dreamer.</p>

<p>Four banners are draped over the facade of the building.</p>

<p>The first was designed by Sigmund Freud. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"The dream is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious attributes of the mind."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second was designed by Carl Gustav Jung. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"So flower-like in its candor and veracity that it puts us to shame for the deceitfulness of our lives."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third is from the abstract impressionist artist Robert Motherwell. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Oppression in art, as in life, is when the conclusion to be reached is predetermined by inner or outer a priori notions of how art ought to be."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fourth is a somewhat changed rendering from a well-known call to arms by Karl Marx in the nineteenth century. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dreamers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your theories."</em></p>

    ns1:description """<p>A hundred years from now our future ‘ancestors’ will look back to appraise, hopefully with compassion, what we have contributed to the evolution of human consciousness. By then, dreams will be such an integral aspect of life that this time in the history of the dream movement will be seen as the crucial step in the development of a global dream awareness. Every new discovery made in the field of dream education and research is a stepping stone creating a path which opens to the vast dimensions and potential of our dreaming mind which leads to the advancement of our human consciousness. </p>

<p>For this particular issue of Dream Network, I was asked to share my involvement in the dream movement, in particular how I came to establish the Dream Study Program at John F. Kennedy University in California. The program is a pioneering graduate program that explores a holistic approach to understanding and working with dreams. It examines the importance of dreams in science, psychology, mythology, shamanism and art and has three concentrations: Education, Consulting and Art. The growing program includes graduate students from various disciplines who are all interested in incorporating dreams into their various professional fields. </p>

<p>My involvement in the dream movement began in the early 80s. I was fortunate to mentor with Daniel Kortenkamp, at the University of Wisconsin, who was one of the very few professors teaching consciousness, parapsychology and dreams at the undergraduate level. He handed me any new publications on dreams including the first issue of <em>Dream Network</em>. From those early publications one could feel the excitement which was hovering in the air. A great magnet was pulling researchers, therapists, educators and artists together to exchange ideas about dreaming. Dreams were a special attraction that bonded people together. In those early days, dream conferences or meetings were like a family reunion. </p>

<p>The first conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) in San Francisco in 1984 not only brought together the scholarly investigation of dreams, but also built a supportive community that has been going strong for 20 years. At the time, I was investigating the scientific and psychological aspects of dreaming as part of my studies, but as an artist, I was also exploring dreams through a different eye. Since the arts were not represented at ASD, I took on the vision of bringing the arts to this developing movement. To researchers and psychologists, it was not immediately obvious that art was a valid and deep way of knowing particularly in relation to dreaming. Scientific investigation is often emphasized as the predominant mode of inquiry in consciousness studies, however, I felt the arts also had an equal place at the foreground in the dream movement as an essential vehicle for exploring the dreaming mind. </p>

<p>This conviction resulted in fifteen years of supporting the arts by instigating the ASD arts committee in 1988; by co-founding Dream Creations (1990) and facilitating the first Bay Area dream artists meeting (1994) all of which have been going strong ever since. </p>

<p>While I engaged with this work in support of the arts, I was also finishing my doctorate degree researching and writing on lucid dreaming and modern art. No matter how supportive the various institutions I had studied and thought at were, I saw a great need for a full-fledged interdisciplinary dream studies program. In the early 90’s I had established an interdisciplinary training program in dreams and offered courses in private practice in my newly established Dream Creation Center in San Francisco. I was also travelling to other centers giving workshops and retreats on Dream Creation Method. Although the teachings were successful and the method was very effective, I wanted to spend my energy developing something more long lasting that could make an impact in the field. I was ambivalent toward establishing a training program of my own so I put out a prayer for being in a receptive academic institution in which I could develop a dream studies program. At the time there were no accredited graduate level university interdisciplinary programs on dreaming, the study of dreams was often folded into the field of psychology. </p>

<p>In 1995, I accepted an associate professor appointment at John F. Kennedy University (JFKU) in the Graduate School of Holistic Studies. In my interview for the position I announced my vision up-front: I let them know that I was interested in developing this program and the Dean of the School was very supportive. Of course I had gained the trust of the institution for six years as an adjunct faculty, teaching many courses on psychology, dreams and art. But creating a new program with no history was certainly challenging. I felt they also made a commitment to support me all the way. At this time, I closed my private practice and put all my energy into the creation of the dream studies program. </p>

<p>The proposal for the dream studies program took several months to develop. I’ll never forget what went through my mind while walking to the Academic Standards meeting with the dream studies proposal in my hand. What could I say to defend dreams in an academic setting? How could I convince the faculty and the chairs of different departments that dreams belong to interdisciplinary studies? How would I voice the importance of this field so that we could defend it with our accreditation Board? How would I take the step toward making dream studies a field amongst the other established disciplines? I had a major task at hand and my only guide and support was my strong conviction that dream awareness is one of the essential steps to discovering our full potential as human beings and its study was essential in the development of human consciousness. Perhaps it was because I felt indebted to the dreaming world for saving my life and bringing so many gifts to it. Perhaps it was having observed the constant transformation that dreams brought to the lives of my students and clients. Perhaps I was guided by the “future ancestors” who were holding my hands to move forward, to lay the groundwork, one stone at the time. I knew for certain that the intention for creating this program had a much larger implication than my own personal agenda. For that matter, I felt humble and held in a very loving and beautiful space. There was no doubt in my mind and I walked in with absolute certainty. </p>

<p>I was drilled with one question after another. But the major concern was that dreams seem to belong to the field of psychology and therefore should be offered under psychology, yet I was determined that dreams belonged to interdisciplinary studies. To me dreams belong to every discipline. We all dream, therefore dreaming benefits everyone and in every field. Although my professional training was in psychology, I saw dreams belonging to a larger field of study. What assisted my argument was my perspective and education from having been at the ASD conferences since their inception and observing the diversity of discourse and inquiry into the field. Dreams are studied and practiced in a variety of disciplines such as religion, anthropology, cognitive science, psychology and the arts. </p>

<p>Developing a program in an academic institution is not an easy task. Every step towards the creation of this program had to go through several committees to be approved. This process can take months or sometimes years. I spoke often with Mena Potts at the Union Graduate School about the development of their Ph.D. program on dreams. To have her program was a great support while at the same time I was proposing an onsite (classroom) program that had different implications. </p>

<p>The development of this program had an organic beginning, at first offering one course on dreams — “Theory and Practice of Dreams” in 1989 — and then growing as I proposed other courses on dreams. The program first began as a concentration within the Department of Interdisciplinary Consciousness in 1996 and then became an independent program in the fall of 2000. To keep the interdisciplinary nature of the program, core courses on dreams were developed with different tracks under the programs in integral psychology, consciousness studies, holistic health and art. Therefore the certificate program’s 36 units is cognitively, experientially and experimentally oriented and has a holistic model of viewing, and working with dreams. </p>

<p>One of the major aspects of developing an educational program within an accredited institution is the creation of a solid professional library. Knowing the importance of this pillar I began working on the library collection when I taught the first course at JFKU in 1989. At that time, they had only a handful of books on dreams whereas they now have one of the most extensive collections of books and journals on dreams. </p>

<p>I believe this program is the first graduate “in-class” program in an accredited academic institution. The implication of this program and hopefully other programs in establishing the field dreams is crucial. Such a program is advancing the field very rapidly as students are beginning to bridge and integrate different disciplines and write very creative and inspiring research papers. Although research and writing on dreams have been prolific since the mid 80’s there is still so much ground-breaking research yet to be done. The excitement of creating a dream program is to see the development of a dream culture. I have witnessed incredibly rich and vibrant dialogues among the students and faculty. Students have been forming dream groups, doing collaborative research projects, having in-depth exchanges of ideas and have much excitement about brining dream education into the world. The dream studies students come from varied fields of study such as business, psychology, education, health, politics, art and consciousness and aspire to bring dreaming into their fields in order to advance them. Some students have continued on to do doctoral work, while others are teaching in colleges and have private dream work practices. Students in the art track are creating incredible interactive dream exhibitions which include creations from dreams while at the same time work to articulate the process of creation. </p>

<p>For me, the most meaningful part of this development has been to witness each student’s major life transformations as they go through the program and to see the harmonious community being created by having one common interest: dreams. The program has already hosted two major ASD regional conferences with students as volunteers and presenters; we also invited our local Bay Area Dream Group (BADG) to have an exchange of ideas and have field trip to the Novato Dream Library and Archives. </p>

<p>As for the dream movement... we have seen so many movements come and go. People go through phases of being interested in a topic, but the dream movement is here to stay as it has always been since ancient times. The difference at this time in history is that dream awareness is crawling into all different walks of lives and is demanding our attention by connecting us together. More and more people will discover that dreaming is an important and integral aspect of their lives and I know that more academic institutions will become open to acknowledge dream studies as a valid and important discipline in their educational systems. </p>

<p>As students of dream studies graduate, we will see more courses taught at colleges and high schools and we will see the creation of more dream centers all over the world. These centers will help bring about a world where: dreaming is discussed regularly at the breakfast table with our families and friends; the wisdom of the ancient cultures, who have for un-known centuries utilized dreams for spiritual guidance and healing, is acknowledged; dreams are used regularly for problem-solving in many fields. Working with dreams is changing our culture by educating us to think metaphorically, by helping us learn to work through our inner conflicts and bring the gift of creativity into our everyday lives. Dream awareness brings hope for our future and gives us a chance to live in a harmonious world. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>For many centuries, Western investigators had little respect or regard for native healing systems. In recent years, however, such prominent psychotherapists as Jeanne Achterberg (1985), E.F. Torrey (1986), and J.D. Frank (Frank &amp; Frank, 1991) have found many native healing systems to be extremely sophisticated and to contain elements that can be instructive for Western practitioners, e.g., the use of imagination and altered states of consciousness for health and personal growth.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-0.jpg" alt="Stanley Krippner" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I have compared the healing models of several native healing traditions with those of allopathic medicine, finding both similarities and differences (Krippner &amp; Welch, 1992). Intending to do the same for dreamworking systems, I located a model proposed by Ullman and Zimmerman (1979) that compared three Western systems, those of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Montague Ullman. I added two facets to the model, and revised several others to provide a better basis for cross- cultural comparison. The resulting 10-facet model still was useful in comparing the systems of Freud, Jung, and Ullman:</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-1.jpg" alt="Montague Ullman" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<h3>1. What is the function of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Freud: To discharge repressed instinctual responses.</p>

<p>B. Jung: To disclose unacknowledged aspects of the self.</p>

<p>C. Ullman: To serve as an adaptive form of consciousness during sleep.</p>

<h3>2. What motivates people to recall their dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Freud: People often try not to recall dreams because they contain repressed material, but in psychoanalysis, the dream is the "royal road to the unconscious" and helps people to understand their personal psychodynamics, e.g., the role of wish fulfillment in dreams.</p>

<p>B. Jung: By recalling dreams, people can work toward individuation, e.g., by understanding how, in dreams, they compensate for the undeveloped parts of their psyche.</p>

<p>C. Ullman: Through dream recall, dreamers can become aware of their waking life predicament and their feelings about it.</p>

<h3>3. What is the source of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains repressed desires.</p>

<p>B. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains the undeveloped aspects of the psyche.</p>

<p>C. Dreams come from the unconscious, which consists of material that dreamers ignore or repress.</p>

<h3>4. What is the language of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>

<p>B. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>

<p>C. Imagery is a vehicle for expressing dream content and feeling as visual metaphors.</p>

<h3>5. Are dream symbols universal?</h3>

<p>A. Sexual symbols occur, in various forms, in all cultures.</p>

<p>B. Archetypal symbols are universal, personal symbols are not.</p>

<p>C. There are no universal symbols; dream imagery is rooted in one's daily experience and in one's culture.</p>

<h3>6. What is the role of one's current life situation in dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Day residue touches off memories of an earlier conflict.</p>

<p>B. Day residue opens up undeveloped parts of the psyche.</p>

<p>C. Day residue opens up issues not attended to while awake.</p>

<h3>7. What techniques are used to work with dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Free association is used in dream working.</p>

<p>B. Free association and amplification are used in dreamworking.</p>

<p>C. Dreamworking assesses dream metaphors through the exploration of the associative context.</p>

<h3>8. What is the role of the dream worker?</h3>

<p>A. Psychoanalysts tell dreamers their dreams' meanings.</p>

<p>B. Psychotherapists function as guides.</p>

<p>C. Psychotherapists and other dreamworkers function as guides but the dreamer is the final felt authority regarding the dream's meaning.</p>

<h3>9. What role do dreams play in the culture?</h3>

<p>A. Dreams reflect a culture's repressed material.</p>

<p>B. Dreams reflect a culture's mythic archetypes.</p>

<p>C. Dreams are socially grounded in the culture and reflect unsolved social as well as personal issues.</p>

<h3>1O. How are anomalous dreams viewed?</h3>

<p>A. Anomalous dreams are subject to the same psychodynamics as other dreams.</p>

<p>B. Anomalous dreams reflect archetypal material and synchronicities.</p>

<p>C. Anomalous dreams are valuable resources, e.g., in understanding emotional interactions.</p>

<p>When doing archival or field research with indigenous groups, this modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used to advantage. However, it is important to try to differentiate "function" and "motive." The "function" of the dream might be conceptualized as adaptive (e.g., to assist the myelinization of nerve cells, to develop the eyes' binocularity) or informational (e.g., to assist in problem-solving, to bring new information to the dreamer). The "motive" to recall one's dreams might be to find game during the hunt, to make contact with deceased relatives, or to receive direction as to one's vocation.</p>

<p>"Function" refers to the operation of the total human organism within a given historical and geographical contex t, while "motive" refers to more specific personal and community goals. Ofien there will be more than one function and more than one motive. In addition, there might be a {natural} function of dreaming (e.g., vigilance during the night) and an overlaid function (e.g., humans have learned to use dreams as natural healing mechanisms).</p>

<p>In identifying the source of dreams, the Western concept of the unconscious may be comparable in some ways to the "spirit realm," the "other world," or other purported realities of which the dreamer is usually unawa re during wakefulness. The language of the dream can be described in terms of dream images as aspects of human imagination or as actual characters cmd events that exist in a parallel or non-ordinary reality. The dreamer's life situation often needs to be studied in terms of community concerns, e.g., hunting, harvesting, fighting, worshiping.</p>

<p>Techniques of working with dreams may include both individual and group dreamwork, if both are present in a given system. The dreamworkers in native cultures might be shamans, mediums, priests, priestesses, etc. Native dreamworking techniques would include those carried out by the tribal practitioner, the family, or the community as a whole. Dreamworking often plays a more important role in native societies than in Western culture, as do anomalous dreams. It is no surprise that these two facets were omitted by Ullman and Zimmerman; I added them because of their ubiquitous presence in native dreamworking systems.</p>

<p>As an example of how the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used cross-culturally, I read accounts of the way dreams were used by the Maricopa tribe. Located in southeastern California, and a member of the Hokan-Yuman linguistic group, the Maricopa Indians lived in domed bark, thatched, or hide houses. When the Europeans arrived in North America, the Maricopa cultivated maize but also gained sustenance from a variety of wild plants and game (Yenne, 1986). At the heart of the Maricopa culture was the dream experience. Spier (1970) remarks that "it was the one thing of which they constantly talked, the [most] significant aspect of their life ... .Dream experience was at the bottom of all success in life, and as such [was] their constant preoccupation. Learning was replaced by dreaming" (p. 236). The way that dreams were used by the Maricopa responds to each of the questions proposed by the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model:</p>

<h3>1. {What is the function of dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams were believed to be nighttime adventures that expressed "spirit, " i.e., supernatural power.</p>

<h3>2. {What motivates people to recall their dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was held that dreams bestowed special abilities (e.g., to heal, to hunt); dreams often produced sacred songs and, rarely, entire song cycles. Dreams enabled guardian spirits to interact with the dreamer. Dreams predicted the future so that the dreamer could attempt to avoid or exploit the forthcoming event. Dreams indicated the degree of success the dreamer might expect in his or her life.</p>

<h3>3. {What is the source of dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was believed that one's soul was "taken out" by power animals or spirits during dreaming to a "dream world," the source of dreams. Songs, cures, future events, etc., were revealed to the soul during dreaming.</p>

<h3>4. {What is the language of dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was thought that dream images were entities from the "dream world" that depicted dreamers' potential abilities, forthcoming circumstances, etc. For example, dream images of Eagle indicated that the dreamer could become a great singer, of Buzzard or Coyote to become a healer, of Mockingbird to become an orator, of Frog to become a sorcerer, of Crow to become a thief. lt was believed that men who dreamed of a certain mountain would become "Berdaches" (i.e., transvestites) and that dreams of birds fighting each other meant that the dreamer would become sick.</p>

<h3>5. {Are dream symbols universal?}</h3>

<p>Meanings of dream images were the same for all tribal members, but there could be multiple meanings for some images, e.g., Buzzard could reveal an enemy's location as well as disclose cures.</p>

<h3>6. {What is the role of one's life situation in dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams could be rehearsals for life events, e.g., pregnancy. One's success depended on dreaming, but it was believed that children who dreamed too much might experience a sex change. The Maricopa took the position that most of their dreams dealt more with the contemporary scene than with tribal myths.</p>

<h3>7. {What techniques are used to work with dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams were frequently discussed among friends. When dreamers told their dreams, they would begin by mentioning the song from their dream, if one was present. Later, song cycles would review important individual dreams for the benefit of the entire community.</p>

<h3>8. {What is the role of the dreamworker?}</h3>

<p>The shaman and the song leader were the tribal authorities on dreams, and would discuss dreams with tribal members. The shaman was considered the expert regarding the cultural meanings of dreams, but both practitioners would frequently dream songs themselves, and would decide what songs of other dreamers would be incorporated into song cycles. However, a dreamer would not reveal a dream to anyone else if the dream involved a spirit visitation over a long period of time; the dreamer would be trained as a warrior, an orator, or a member of some other vocation during sleep. It was only after the spirits pronounced their preparation complete that the dreamer could use the powers they granted.</p>

<h3>9. {What role do dreams play in the culture?}</h3>

<p>It was held that spirits only manifest themselves in dreams, and that they grant specific powers to dreamers who are conscientious and prepared. More than any other activity, dreams established and reinforced the unity of the Maricopa culture.</p>

<h3>10. {How are anomalous dreams viewed?}</h3>

<p>It was believed that supernatural power only comes in dreams. The Maricopa used the same word {cara'g} for "spirit" and "dream."</p>

<p>The educational and training function by dreams among the Maricopa demonstrate how malleable the dreaming process is, and how a culture can shape its members' dreams. The social roots of the dream have been discussed by Ullman (1960) who observed how cultural myths serve to make experience intelligible, and that the unsolved problems of individuals in that culture are worked with within that mythic framework. Myths often come to life in a dream as sources of support or as sources of cmxiety, depending on the underlying nature of the immediate conflict (p. 184).</p>

<p>This brief discussion illustrates the value of studying dream systems from other cultures. It can demonstrate the limits of social frameworks in which the individual dream operates, as well as the limits of idiosyncratic elements that dreamers bring to their dream experience. It is easier to detect mythic elements in the dreams of people from native societies than from dreamers from societies without a monolithic mythic structure. In these cases, however, the impact of family and institutional myths may be detected. There is an urgent need for more information in these areas, and cross-cultural research can play an important role in this quest.</p>

<p>On a bright April morning in 1975, I had the following dream: Across the room from where I sat frustrated by my inability to create, a group of women taught arts and crafts at large tables. I arose from my lonely corner to leave in a spirit of failure and despair. As I walked away, a voice boomed out "At least there is AION!" I awoke to the new day in Zurich, Switzerland with the letters A-I-O-N emblazoned on my mind. I walked to the morning lecture at the Jung Institute - puzzled. What is AION?</p>

<p>At noon I joined a friend for lunch in his room near the Institute. As I related my dream, I looked to the bookshelf to my right. Squarely before my eyes stood the title AION: The Phenomenology of The Self (Vol. 9.,11 The Collected Works of C. G. Jung). This and other synchronistic events and dreams confirmed my calling to work on the frontiers of inner space. </p>

<p>Whereas many Jungians explored the depths of symbols, archetypes, complexes and myths, I was drawn to Jung's idea of active imagination and the transcendent function. </p>

<h2>Waking Dream Re-entry</h2>

<p>Waking dream re-entry is a particular approach to active imagination in which the dreamer re-enters the dream space while fully awake. Effective questions assist the dreamer to act consciously within the waking dream. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stampeded by My First Love: A dreamer shared a recurring nightmare, still vivid after forty years. "I was standing on a path in a meadow where horses were grazing. The horses stampeded. I fell on the path and awoke in terror as their hooves crashed down on my face. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked: "Can you see yourself in the dream?" she responded, "Yes." "How old are you?" "Four!" she responded in surprise. "What was happening when you were four?" "Oh! That was when my parents divorced. They sent me to my grandparents' horse ranch." "What is important to you about horses?" "They are my first love. Ah! I see." </p>

<p>Can you see yourself in the dream now?" "Yes." "What do you see?" "I see the horses coming. I fall. I wake up as the hooves come down on my face." "Now, go back, only this time stay in the dream. If you could do anything differently, what would you do?" "If I could reach up and grab a mane, I might save myself." "Go there now. Do you see it?" "Yes. The horses are bearing down. I reach up and grab the mane of a big chestnut. I pull myself up on his back. Wow!" "What is happening now?" "I feel his power beneath me. I feel on top of things." "What do you want to do?" "I want to ride off... Oh! I didn't realize how angry I felt toward my parents for leaving me." </p>

<h2>Instant Re-play and The Inner Image</h2>

<p>Instant re-play allows the dreamer, who has wandered up a blind alley, to return to the point of choice and pursue a course of action from a new emotional standpoint. The ability to explore various emotional choices to their natural end, in the waking dream, provides the dreamer clear pictures of the obstacles and consequences of paths that might otherwise prove costly in waking life. </p>

<p>From Jung's definition of the inner image, as a "condensed expression of the psychic situation as a whole", it follows that as the psychic situation changes so does the inner image; and as the inner image changes, so does the psychic situation. The goal is to participate consciously in the movement of the psyche as it spontaneously reflects its responses to our actions and choices within the waking dream. </p>

<p>By discovering ways that the psyche moves us toward healing and reconciliation, we learn how to accelerate the healing relationship between the dreamer, the dreamed, and the world.</p>

<p>Family-related feelings and family consciousness are some of the most powerful influences on the psychological patterns of individuals. The influence of family patterns is extraordinarily powerful in its depth and intensity. Because of this, we frequently dream about the members of our families. It is quite common and normal to have dreams in which family members are prominently involved. The vast majority of these dreams are the usual dreams in which a parent or sibling is doing something that we generally recognize as their normal behavior. Sometimes, however, they are doing something unusual or even paradoxical in our dreams. Very often, extremely strong feelings and images occur which show us the emotions we feel toward these special people in our lives. The dream, with its strange contours and story-line, is the perfect field on which to portray "raw" emotions, and consequently, the dream can really be a pulse taken on the heartbeat of family life.</p>

<p>Over the last century Freud and others have told us that dreams both hide and reveal what people deep down <em>really</em> feel and think about each other and themselves. In the dream state our hold on reality is not as well guarded as it is when we are wide awake. Our psychological defenses are to a large extent gone and what appears to be "reality" becomes very intense and visual. We have learned from jung and his followers that there are great spiritual energies, treasures, and messages from the collective unconscious hidden in dreams. This collective unconscious is a vast reservoir of knowledge, wisdom, and experience that has been experienced and collected by humanity through the ages.</p>

<p>We also know that lucid dreaming and ancient healing practices make use of entering the dream in a certain kind of way and using its power to transform reality. Thus it has become quite clear that we can influence the dream much more than we had earlier thought we could. finally we know from many parapsychological studies that ESP or psi occurs a great deal in certain kinds of dreams, especially between dreamers who are both dreaming about the same person. Any number of possibilities can occur when we are dreaming because the "boundaries" between individuals change significantly in the dream state. </p>

<p>For example, after a sleepfilled night in December, my wife and I mentioned our dreams to each other as is our custom. I had dreamed a strange dream in which a "grandmother type" was trying to reach or catch me. She triggered "mixed feelings" in me as to whether she was trying to protect me or somehow "get me." Also in the dream the grandmother attempted to steal or cut off a pickle I had! Having a somewhat Freudian lens, I made note of the sexual aspect of this. I later woke with a slightly eerie feeling about the dream. </p>

<p>On the same night my wife dreamed my grandmother had a necklace with a moon-shaped crescent locket which fell partly from her neck and turned into a knife or sharp edge. My wife then wondered in the dream whether the grandmother was gay. </p>

<p>Notice the correspondences in the grandmother images, the sexual feelings, and the act of cutting. These appeared in both dreamscapes. Neither of us had discussed grandmothers for a long time and we could remember no events recently that would account for the dream in terms of day residue. </p>

<p>While on a post-doctoral fellowship, I had the opportunity to study the dreams of families in therapy. To my surprise, we discovered that recurrent patterns of interaction and behavior are reflected in the dreams of each family member. This was especially true when the family was going through a crisis or some intense situation. </p>

<p>We noted the simple fact that families are often living in the same place, including the same house and rooms for decades and sometimes for generations. They are often in similar sleep and dream cycles at the same time of the night. Certain coordinating tendencies could be seen. It became very clear to us that the major emotional issues in the family were each reflected in slightly different ways in each family member's inner landscape. In a certain sense, each family member's dream life reflected the dream life of each other family member. </p>

<p>In one family, we worked with the following recurring dream of a 15 year old girl. She dreamed that she "escaped" from her parents' house and jumped into their car. As she drove away, the father would run toward her but never manage to quite catch her. The closer he got, the faster the car went. Finally the girl fully escaped him only to run headlong into a telephone pole and kill herself. In this family's therapy sessions, the themes of autonomy and separation with a great deal of anxiety occurred repeatedly. The daughter fought continually with her parents over her own intense involvement with a young man of whom the family did not approve. She felt rebellious and dominated by her parents, in particular her father. However, when she stayed away from home too long, she began to experience somatic problems and wanted to "lose" herself in male companionship. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dalegottlieb.com/" target="_blank"></p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfamil-1.jpg" alt="Couple dancing" width="500" height="auto"/></p>

<p></a></p>

<p>Another dream by the girl's 12 year old sister revealed a similar theme. The younger girl dreamed that a large "awful" man ran around screaming at her mother, her older sister, and herself. Finally, the man stepped on all three but did not kill them. The dream recurred several times. The family that provided this dream series was composed of a father who had a manic-depressive psychosis, an extremely religious, compulsive mother, and two teenage girls. All three women in the family had psychosomatic problems, such as stomach cramps, persistent gas pains, migraines, and frequent depression.</p>

<p>In working with families in therapy and others, we noted that psi or telepathy often occurs in a variety of situations. We noted that different families naturally had different styles and that certain families communicated, albeit irregularly, with each other through dreams. Some families rarely, if ever, did. In some measure these psi or paranormal dreams can be predic- ted and observed. We found this a very exciting discovery and as we talked with others, we found out more and more people have had the same kind of experiences in their families too. </p>

<p>What we discovered was a field of <em>shared</em> images, ideas, and feelings in each individual within the family. This shared family emotional field, which we call the family unconscious, is a shifting, interconnected field of energy that does not obey the conventional rules of space and time in the waking state. This field of interconnected energy, influence, and information in many ways parallels some of the developments in sub-atomic physics. In a curious way, each emotional dreamscape reflected or implicated each other dreamscape. A certain kind of hologram appeared in which each part could reflect all other parts in slightly different ways. </p>

<p>We know that our "boundaries" and identities intermingle in the dream state with those we dream about. This seems to take a systematic approach when it comes to the dreams of people who are deeply and powerfully interconnected with each other over years and years by shared events, feelings, and patterns of behavior such as in family life. The powerful emotions and the shared histories of families make this possible. There also seems to be a significant rise in psi experiences among such dreamers. As we have outlined in <em>The Family Unconscious</em>, dreams among family members can be used for all kinds of transpersonal work, including family therapy and other kinds of healing. As we continue to collect data about family dreams and explore other areas of the family unconscious, we are growing more and more convinced that a vast reservoir of healing is located in the collected dreams and memories of the people who are most dear to us through so many important years of our lives.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>After twenty years of lucid dreaming and many hundreds of lucid dreams, I had <em>had</em> it. </p>

<p>The <em>maya</em> of dreaming, the <em>maya</em> of waking and the <em>maya</em> of being consciously aware in the dream state, I discovered, all seemed creative constructions that were activated and informed by my thoughts, expectations, feelings, and beliefs. My experienced reality, I came to see, was largely self-created and self-reflected.</p>

<p>Yet somehow I intuitively felt that behind all of this <em>maya</em> was something—some motivating force, some energy, some thing beyond me and my beliefs, thoughts, and expectations. It seemed to me that beyond the symbolic feedback and entrancing worldly drama of samsara must lay the source of the myriad worlds. I sought the source. </p>

<p>It was then that I realized I had only one choice: to go <em>beyond</em> lucid dreaming; to let go of my own expectations, my thoughts and limiting conceptions, my self history and attachments—to let it all go and then experience the reality beyond thought and belief, the base reality, the source of what is. </p>

<p>For years in lucid dreams, I had surrendered to the awareness behind the dreaming. Consciously aware in the dream state, I would shout out, “Show me something that I should see!” and then watch as I was deposited, conscious and aware, into a powerfully meaningful dream setting. Lucidly surrendering to the awareness behind the dreaming taught me to trust implicitly the larger nature of the dreaming self and its wisdom. </p>

<p>But now, I knew that to experience the reality behind all of this, meant letting go of all of this. To surrender to one’s inner self was one thing, but to surrender to the source of <em>maya</em> took surrendering to a completely new level. </p>

<p>Lying awake in bed one night at this time, I inwardly heard the question, “So you are ready to let go of everything? Every thought, every memory, every belief?” Because I truly had had it with maya, I answered, “Yes!” The quiet voice returned with a simple analysis, “So you’re willing to allow yourself to cease?” </p>

<p>That question brought a sober finality to my quest. How far was I willing to take this venture beyond lucid dreaming? How deeply did I want to know what lay beyond apparent reality? </p>

<p>Realizing that all these states— dreaming, waking, lucid dreaming— appeared as creative constructions formatively created by the mind, I knew my response to that sober question must be, “Yes, if that’s what it takes.” </p>

<p>Perhaps it wasn’t that night, but soon something strange occurred to me. Waking in the morning and turning to my dream journal to jot down the night’s dreaming, all I could recall was blue light. Searching my mind, I realized that I didn’t have a dream—only an experience of blue light. No action, objects, dream figures or plot, not even a “me.” Just an awareness of blue light. </p>

<p>In my book, <em><a href="https://www.lucidadvice.com/books/lucid-dreaming-gateway-to-the-inner-self/">Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</a></em>, I mention how one morning after a night of experiencing dreamless blue light, my wife asked me at the breakfast table, “Robert, what’s happening to you?” A bit taken aback by such a strange question, I responded, “What do you mean?” She then told me how she had wakened in the night and saw my face; she told me I looked like I was in “bliss.” </p>

<p>I muttered something about trying to understand consciousness and left it at that, though I felt surprised my wife had noticed “something” was happening to me. </p>

<p>Actually, even I did not understand what was really happening to me. As if I had driven off the normal map of human experience and was now bushwhacking through uncharted territory, I had no context to place this in, or weathered guru to provide explanations. I felt on a path of my own making, being guided by my simple faith, fearlessness, and trust. I had had it with maya, and deeply intended to experience the source of apparent reality. </p>

<p>As the months slipped by, a transformational, culmination experience occurred, which I can only call a nondual experience of the light of awareness by awareness itself. At last, I had gone beyond lucid dreaming—beyond thought and self, beyond the self-constructed illusions of the mind—and reached something unfathomable, luminous, and empty, <em>pure awareness</em>. </p>

<p>For years, I kept this to myself. How can you explain going beyond lucid dreaming? How can the self discuss a self-less experience? Yet at my core, something had been transformed. Like survivors of NearDeath Experiences (NDEs), I no longer had a fear of death. I began to see how fear kept us corralled in a self adopted realm of limitation and constraint. At a deep level, I felt expansive freedom and space. </p>

<p>Almost three years later, I happened to attend a presentation by the Buddhist Bon Lama, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, at the Association for the Study of Dreams conference in Hawaii. Speaking about the Buddhist’s long tradition of dream yoga (using conscious awareness in the dream state), he explained that its ultimate goal was to experience a profound, non-dual state: the clear light of awareness.</p>

<p>It’s not for me to say whether my experience equates to this ultimate experience of dream yoga. However, I can say that lucid dreaming’s deeper explorations naturally allow for a transformational view of the human experience and the nature of reality. </p>

<p>Followed deeply and with pure intent, conscious awareness in the dream state allows us to experiment with the fluid nature of time and space as we consciously seek out telepathic and clairvoyant experiences, and use our awareness for tasks like focusing directed healing energy on our physical self. Lucid dreaming enables us to go beyond our normal assumptions of dream figures and objects and interact with the awareness behind the dream, the larger Self, even surrendering to its broader perspective. </p>

<p>Beyond self transformation, however, lucid dreaming provides science a revolutionary psychological tool to conduct experiments while consciously aware in the dream state. Imagine an experiment in which a lucid dreamer seeks out and retrieves precognitive or clairvoyant information that he or she gives to the scientist upon waking. It’s definitely possible. In my book, I provide numerous examples of experienced lucid dreamers who have succeeded in their own personal experiments. </p>

<p>Once the province of parapsychologists and Buddhist monks, lucid dreaming has radical transformational potential to usher in a new age of human potential and greater awareness. Individually, scientifically and culturally, lucid dreaming can help us discover the broader dimensions of Self and in so doing, transform society and its relationships. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Do you ever wish you could have a really <em>BIG DREAM?</em> You might imagine what it would be like: a great opportunity. Some people report having life defining dreams that remain vividly in mind for years. </p>

<p>Who wouldn’t want such an experience? In ones’ imagination, the <em>big dream</em> might be extremely vibrant, or be of the utmost clarity. Most certainly, it would be memorable and life changing. The dream might spark a spiritual awakening. </p>

<p>In an attempt to find out more about the big dream, I looked through my dream book collection. Some of the authors assured readers that their books on dreams provided all the information they needed to know about dreams. Nevertheless, scanning tables of contents, chapter titles, section labels, and indices failed to turn up any direct reference to the big dream. </p>

<p>The big dream was even elusive on the internet. The term was there. Some “big dream” sites attempted to tell internet surfers what they “really” want out of life. One site had a synchronicity card pack for sale. Another site was about a church building fund. Even “bigdream.com” billed as “your source for virtually anything” wasn’t a source of information about big dreams. On a hunch, I revisited The World Dream Book by Sarvananda Bluestone. He used the term, “great dream.” He also provided a simple yet significant reminder that “ … there are many kinds of dreams, it lies with the dreamer to determine the nature of the dream and it remains for each person to determine his dreams’ lessons.” </p>

<p>There is certainly the chance that many of us have had a big dream and failed to recognize it. We’ve been conditioned in our society to expect important things to make a big impression. The big dream may fail to get our full attention at first. </p>

<p>Symbolically, the International Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) has been like a big dream for me that began quietly but grew in importance as I worked with it. It has helped me to satisfy my intention to learn more about dreams by providing reading material, group study opportunities, dream sharing groups, and research reports. Most importantly, it has provided the opportunity to be a part of a dedicated community of dreamers. Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell are vital members of that community. </p>

<p>I met Rita when I attended an Association for the Study of Dreams annual conference for the first time. Prior to the conference, I had little contact with the organization. Rita made quite a fuss over me. She explained how she had seen my name as a founding member of the association on paperwork for about 14 years and wondered who this phantom person might be. Her welcome made me feel very much at home during a personally and professionally rough time in my life. Immediately after the conference, I got to enjoy her company when a small group of members went out to supper before returning home. Remembering the event brought a heartfelt smile as I recalled such a warm feeling of belonging. Over time, I became aware of how vitally important Rita was to the association and all of the people she has welcomed. Years later, at another conference, I was just turning to leave the ball, when Rita reached out and asked me to dance. I wondered if she had sensed that I felt alone and reached out once again to make me feel right at home. </p>

<p>I met Jean Campbell at an ASD Conference in Copenhagen a few years ago. I knew about her marvelous “Dream Bridge” project that allowed children from different countries to share their dreams. I can recall with fondness, sitting on a restaurant boat with Jean and another member as Jean shared her dreams, plans, and hopes for the organization. The weather was chilly and rainy, but she projected an air of confidentiality that made me feel like a life long friend. At a subsequent conference, I was pleased to learn that she had been elected as president of the association and I worked just briefly with her on a project. More recently, I received a note card from Jean in the mail. She was complementing me on an article I had written. I was tickled to read the compliment in her beautifully written script even before I had gotten a chance to see the article in print myself. </p>

<p>Like dream characters, Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell came into my life for an admittedly brief period of time, but have had an ongoing and meaningful effect. In order to fully appreciate the positive impact these two dedicated individuals have had on the lives of others, however, we would literally have to visit with people all over the world. You can bet that Rita and Jean represent portions of the big dreams of many individuals. So, if you get a chance to meet Rita and Jean, be sure to see that opportunity as potentially life changing, something like a big dream coming your way. ∞</p>

<p>It was summer of 1985 when I met Stanley Krippner in the hallway lounge of the University of Charlottesville, Virginia at the second conference of the Association for the study of Dreams (ASD). A few months prior to the conference I had a very disturbing precognitive dream that needed serious attention. I was in my mid-twenties, a graduate student conducting research on insomnia and apnea at the University of Stevens Point, Wisconsin. </p>

<p>I called Stanley in California and asked if I could meet with him at the conference in Charlottesville to work on my dream. He agreed immediately and we set a time and a place. The dream was about my father and it was a matter of life and death. I was familiar with Stanley’s research from my training in parapsychology. I thought he would be the best person to help me work with this kind of dream. But I had no idea that this simple request of having him work with my dream was to be the beginning of a life-long collegial and personal friendship. </p>

<p>With his openness and gentle manner, he asked me to tell him the dream. I was emotional while I recited the short dream. He asked “How do you know this is a precognitive dream?” I gave him examples of my past precognitive dreams and their particular felt sense. Without hesitation, he confirmed my intuition and replied “O.K. Let’s see how we can work with this dream and do something about it!” I was so relieved with his reply. Others with whom I shared the dream only looked at the symbolic and psychological implications and did not even know how to approach the precognitive aspect. It took us over two hours, looking into the details of the situation, to create a plan to prevent the dream from happening. This solution was complicated, but we drafted a plan and I followed it step-by-step. Likewise, I asked that my family also follow it step-by-step. As a result, my father’s life was saved. </p>

<p>What most touched me about Stanley in that very first meeting was his quality of presence. He listened, had empathy and absolute compassion. Although he is always busy, in that moment he gave me/my dream all of his attention. His openness, brilliance, his humanity and wisdom shined through his humility. At the end of our meeting, I knew I was in the presence of <strong><em>an extraordinary human being</em></strong>. </p>

<p>With his encouragement, a few months later I moved to San Francisco. I attended his monthly dream training group for number of years at the Family Mediation Center and watched his approach with dreams; in particular, Personal Mythology and Ullman’s Dream Appreciation group process. In the latter approach, every member takes the dream as if that is his/her own. When Stanley owned the dream, his creative mind would connect the metaphors and narrative of the dream into hyper-reality, filled them with psychological reflections and insights to the amazement of everyone in the group. Not repeating anyone else but acknowledging everyone’s contribution, he always had a fresh perspective to lend the dream. His mastery is also evident in the last part of the technique in Ullman’s approach, “Synthesis.” In this ‘closure’ part of Ullman’s suggested process, we watched Stanley’s brilliant mind at work. A master synthesizer and a true composer, he would weave together everyone’s input and interpretation of the dream, together with the life of the dreamer. Then he would give an entirely new and holistic narrative with reflection and great insight that would not only help the dreamer but everyone in the group. A complex networking of metaphors, ideas, psychological observations, personal narrative woven into an elegant synthesis creating a spatial and imaginal realm for whomever was present. Everyone was transfixed at his exceptional skill in dreamwork. When Stanley is working with dreams he is a shamanic practitioner. His model of working with dreams as a form of service was a great influence on my process of working with dreams. </p>

<p>Stanley is known for accomplishing so much in one lifetime. One day in 1986, I asked him “But how do you manage to do so many things?” He could not explain but he encouraged me to come to his office and watch how he worked. So I did. I went to his office a few times, I sat behind a desk making illustrations for his new book <em>Dreamworking</em> and graphics for some of his articles for parapsychology handbooks while watching him work. In a middle size office there were several desks each with different projects, quite orderly; he attended notes to each piece of paper at hand, each mail he opened, he replied to immediately. There was no such thing as taking care of it later. That is the reason he still responds to inquiries immediately. He works as if he had six hands and several brains! He deals with different topics, different types of inquiries and his mind had to keep switching from one to another. But he always concentrated at the task at hand. He was extremely focused and attentive. A ‘multitasker’ par excellence! </p>

<p>That was my learning ground. I really don’t know anyone who has accomplished as much as he has in so many areas. </p>

<p>As someone from another culture and who at times has suffered from discrimination — even in my own field — I’ve found Stanley to be a genuine lover of cultural diversity. He embraces people from many other nationalities. His work and on-going research with South Americans, Russian, East Europeans, Native Americans, Africans now Middle Easterners has given him a much larger perspective, openness and compassion towards the common places in humanity as well as an appreciation for cultural diversity. He indeed has become an extraordinary multidimensional being. </p>

<p>One of our meaningful collaborative efforts was bringing this diversity as program co-chairs for the IASD conference in 1991, which was hosted by another dear colleague Robert van de Castle. Ironically the conference was held on the same campus where we first met — in Charlottesville! We dedicate the conference to diversity and interdisciplinary studies and I was impressed with the number of researchers who have become close friends of his from such diverse groups. We invited keynote speakers from Native American, Afro-American, Spanish and a North American cultures. This was the first time such diverse keynote speakers were introduced into the program and ever since then diversity has become an integral and important part of IASD. Our message in that conference was that dreams belong to every culture, every religion. In other words, dreams belong to the people of the world. </p>

<p>Our collaboration with the book <em>Extraordinary Dreams</em> (SUNY, 2002) brought us ever so closer. This was another diverse collaboration with his colleague André Percia de Carvalho, a Brazilian psychologist. Challenging as it was to bring three voices from different cultures, the results were rich and rewarding. In that process, I learned how important it is for Stanley to see that others be properly acknowledged, sometimes at the expense of not acknowledging himself. He does not seek competition but true collaboration and contribution. What makes Stanley stand out as an extraordinary human being is his nonegoic, non-judgmental, ever encouraging and generous attitude and spirit. He has opened doors for many young scholars internationally. His total commitment, dedication and service for transformation of consciousness is absolutely admirable. It was the inspiration of having a mentor like Stanley who works so consistently and diligently that gave me the courage and strength—against all odds—to create the dream studies program at John F. Kennedy U. </p>

<p>Stanley has a keen sense of perception and I always trust his insights. Although he is internationally known as a serious scholar, author and teacher, he also has a very eccentric and creative side. He is a lover of theater, music and the arts. He loves to dance and always without fail shows up at the IASD Dream Ball costumed up as a dream character. His insights to my artworks and performances have been invaluable, original and profound. I am always curious about his comments. Having known and worked with Stanley for almost twenty-five years now, I know he evolves with modern life and at the same time has the wisdom of the ancient world. He is one of those special beings on earth who is mortal yet immortal. His stories, influences, contributions to humanity will be passed on for many generations, making him eternal. </p>

<p>Stanley, I am ever so grateful to you for being my mentor, colleague and friend. You have been a pillar of strength in every community you have been involved. I feel privileged to know you and I am looking forward to many years of stimulating collaboration and creation with you. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>A taste of Cyberspace for those wondering what's going on with dreaming and Internet</em></p>

<p>If you haven't been online yet, your first experience might be something like walking into a surprise party. Everyone wants your attention and many will share your same interests, no matter how off-beat. I know that Al Gore talks about the "Information Super-highway" (1) and everyone gets excited about how much data is available but the real surprises online are the people. This human connection exists at several levels, from casual and committed one on one relationships, to global community connectivity and activism. As might be expected, these levels of relationship hold true for dream concerned individuals and groups as well. </p>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

<p>Originally designed as ARPA Net by the U.S. Defence Department in the late 1960's to protect political telecommunications in case of an atomic war, the net was a series of four computers that all shared &amp; exchanged the same information. By 1971 it had attracted the attention of the universities and there were 21 host computers, but no one was sure what the common language was going to be between all these computers. By 1982, the decision was made (TCP/ IP), and by 1986 there were 5,000 host computers , mostly at universities and government offices and all able to talk the same language and share the same information. By 1989, the Internet hit the public and media and there were 100,000 host computers. The last figure I heard for 1995 was that the Net had reached 5 million computers. (2)</p>

<p>To be connected to the internet, all one has to have now is a computer, a modem, some Internet software and an account with an Internet Service Provider. If you don't have a free university or government account, there are a multitude of providers and most now give you all the software you need when you sign up with them. The average cost ranges from $10 - $25 per month. The number of people using the Internet is already uncountable, but to give you a tool by which to guess the near future , I want to paraphrase Bill Clinton's October 1995 directive: "By the year 2000, all U.S. schools K-12 will be connected." (3) What will we and our children have access to when we start a computer net search for "Dreams"?</p>

<h2>Dreaming in Cyberspace</h2>

<p>To answer that question, it is important to know the distinction between the Internet and Cyberspace. The Internet is a more technical term, the way we connect with one another in computer mediated communications. Cyberspace is the place where this all happens. And there are several kinds of platforms or venues in Cyberspace that dream concerned individuals use. The most popular are E-mail, World Wide Web (WWW) and Usenet.</p>

<h2>Usenet, IRC and Chatrooms</h2>

<p>Usenet is a group of electronic discussion boards started in 1979 to discuss various university curriculum topics, but since that time Usenet has exploded into hundreds of topic from saving the rainforests to chat about the latest episode of the X-files. Like a real bulletin board, one can post messages, read other's messages and leave replies. The first dream bulletin board (alt.dreams) went up just a couple years ago and allows individuals to post dreams and dream related issues as well as making comments on the posts that go up. Some people want advice on how to recall dreams, some want their dreams interpreted, some want to start small online dreamsharing groups. The level of discussion is very uneven and the board is predominately used as a way for people new to dreaming online to ask questions and get connected with more serious projects. But I'm hoping in the near future to include on alt.dreams discussions on dream theory, dream research and the wide array of techniques used by dreamworkers. Also I see alt.dreams as an excellent venue for networking local and regional dream groups, distributing news and developing mutually supportive projects. </p>

<p>In the last year, two more dream related Usenet groups have appeared. The first is alt.dreams.lucid, a discussion board just for lucid dreaming issues, and alt.dreams.Castaneda, which discusses all of the Castaneda issues, but seems most invigorated by the variations on lucid dreaming that are being practiced. Other newsgroups such as alt.psychology.Jung and talk.religion.new age will occasionally discuss dreams in light of their own particular viewpoints. </p>

<p>A spin-off of the newsgroups are the real time internet Relay Chat channels. On the IRC channels you can enter one of hundreds of ongoing real time discussions, simply by typing in a sentence or two and sending it to a screen where others in the room are also sending sentences. Or you can create you own rooms, invite your friends or associates or wait for visitors. Complex interactions and threads can take place but generally the quality is usually lower than on Usenet. There are exceptions. These Chat rooms are also available on most commercial online servers and Fred Olsen has been doing dream reentry work on both Genie and AOL. His directed questions style works quite well in this real time mode. Another notable exception is the Dream Studio, which Donna Campos opens on Mondays nights at 6:00 PM EST on Compuserve. She invites a different guest each week to discuss a variety of dream topics. The key to these chat channels seems to be having a host or guiding moderator.</p>

<h2>The World Wide Web (WWW): Internet Gets a Friendly Face</h2>

<p>In 1990, a couple of CERN physicists in Switzerland were given the task of developing a network that could be used by a variety of international physicists. What they came up with was the World Wide Web, a system that could go out on the Net and use any resource. In 1993, Marc Andreessen gave this route a friendly face by developing for NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the Univ. of Ill. in Urbana-Champaign) a program called Mosaic browser. He gave Mosaic away to the public for free. By December of 1993, over a thousand browsers a day were being downloaded (taken from the net).</p>

<p>What these browsers do is allow net connected users to travel from one friendly page to another at the click of a mouse. These friendly pages, or web sites (collections of pages), run about $10.00 to $30.00 a month to put up commercially and are free to many university students. What do people put on these pages? Everything! Pictures of themselves and their kids, one's life story, all the things you want to sell, and links that let you jump to other sites, your friends' sites, your business site, similar interest sites. And so, of course, we all put the dreams and dream information we want other people to know about on our web pages.</p>

<p>There are now dozens of Web sites that include information on dreams and dreaming. Dream Network Journal has as site, Electric Dreams has a site, and even ASD and the Lucidity Institute Inc., have sites. A good place to start browsing is a directory of many (not all) dream sites on Yahoo web directory. I've also made available a file called Dream Guide to the Internet which covers most of the sites and how dreaming is represented online. (4) </p>

<p>There are also several dream sharing sites now on the Web. The most interactive and sophisticated at this time is Dream Link. At Dream Link, you can not only finds lots of information about dreams, but actually participate in interactive dreams sharing. It works kind of like a specialized bulletin board. You go to the site with a Web browser and leave your dream and information about your dream. Linton and Becky Hutchison distribute your dream to their network and put both your dream and comments on the dream back up on one of their web pages. The future of the Internet is to be found in the Web. The now static pages will give way to real time video channels and more Interactive forums. But at this time, the one thing you can't get on your Web browser is electronic mail, and e-mail rules the Internet.</p>

<h2>E-mail, E-zines and Mail Lists.</h2>

<p>In early 1993 when the Web was still more of a great idea than a reality, if you wanted to connect with someone on more than a superficial level you used email. We still do. E-mail is like a regular letter except that it's cheaper and faster. I can send a ten page letter from my home in San Francisco to my friends in Australia for about 3 cents. And it gets there in minutes. (Of course, they are probably asleep and won't read and reply for several hours!) What is even better, I can make a copy of that letter and send it to everyone I have-ever met in Cyberspace with an Internet e-mail address (say about a thousand addresses) for the same 3 cents. If I did this, I would probably get 999 letters back, each costing me 3 cents, telling me to knock it off and please send only relevant, personal letters - but I think the point is clear. </p>

<p>E-mail mini-dream groups are easy to start and inexpensive to maintain. They have sprung up all over the globe. Usually with a dozen or less participants, email groups share dreams and comments about each other's dreams. They may last a week, or become a permanent group of friends. </p>

<p>In August of 1993, I found one such community that had grown to about 30 members and put out every couple of weeks a magazine, (or e-zine) Electric Dreams. Originally the community used the e-zine to distribute dreams and comments on the dreams from previous issues. But the members wanted to cut down on the 2 week time lag between dreams and comments. The solution was to have the dreams distributed to those interested in commenting so that dreams and comments would be printed together every week or two. </p>

<p>These dreamsharings were certainly not the same as off-line or face-to-face groups, but I felt very excited about the process and felt there was a great networking potential in sharing dreams on a global scale. I had recently been impressed with the networking style of Jill Gregory, the director of the Novato Center for Dreams. Through a variety of news bulletins, dream groups and other interpersonal projects, the dreamers in the Bay area maintain a creative personal community, while at the same time staying in contact with the international dream community. I wanted to model this regional approach on a global scale and added news, projects and other forums to the Electric Dreams community - but the core of the process, the dreamsharing, still needed some anchoring. </p>

<p>Early in 1995 I found an online model for dreamsharing. John Herbert had been running a variation of Montague Ullman style groups on the America Online (AOL) Seniornet. John had also run these groups earlier on local Bulletin Boards or BBS and compared them to face-to-face groups. (5) These BBS are local computer networks that allow people to dial up and participate in various activities, from getting software to playing games, to doing genealogical research. He would have the participants work on one dream at a time, first asking clarification questions, then making comments in the Ullman "if this were my dream..." style. At each step, the dreamer had a chance to respond if he or she wished. Now on AOL, John uses a similar bulletin board style, and participants can anonymously post dreams and comments within the mediated process. His preliminary research indicates that the online groups provide as much or more insight than face-to-face groups. Generally he attributes this to the reflective, unpressured time that dreamer and respondents have to make comments. </p>

<p>I took this process back to the Electric Dreams community, modified it for e-mail and have been trying out variations for about a year. The first were round-robins, where we had one file and a list of participants. The file was passed around with the next addresses of where to send the file. As the growing file passed through the mediator and dreamer, the next phase was enacted; from dream presentation, to clarification questions, to replies and comments. It was an administrative nightmare. We switched to a process suggested by Jay Vinton to simply have everyone maintain the group list and send each comment or reply to everyone else on the list. This has worked pretty well and if the continually positive and enthusiastic comments received from the dreamers at the end of the process continue, the two week group mail list will become a permanent fixture to the Electric Dreams community.</p>

<p>The two week Post-and-Comment style dreamsharing is still a part of Electric Dreams and recently I added a special mail list distribution and communication channel to facilitate this. Interested subscribers join the list and can not only submit dreams, but discuss the dreams as well as comments and aspects of dream interpretation in general. Bob Krumhansl pulls all the relevant dialogues, dreams and comments together and we publish them for the whole community every two or three weeks.</p>

<p>Electric Dreams continues to be a kind of eye on Internet for dreamers and a forum for direct dreamsharing, education and news. But even more it is a swarm of mutant butterflies in Cyberspace, a community experimenting with dreamsharing at its core. New forms of dreamsharing appear every week and with the addition of new technologies, even more forms will soon be available.</p>

<h2>Technological Solution or Social Revolution?</h2>

<p>Many people are wary of the Internet and the promises of its being just the latest in a series of 19th and 20th Century technological solutions that end up causing more harm than good. I agree with this caution and feel the Net will probably bring with it more problems than solutions. Just like democracy and Rock &amp; Roll. I'm afraid it is already past the point of trying to pack it up and send it back to National Science Foundation. What we can do is become involved and shape the way that online interaction occurs. For example, just as with off-line dreamsharing, on line dreamsharing continues the valuing of inner resourcefulness, of intuitive perception, of supporting each person in being his or her own authority in matters of meaning and value and bringing those out into the community at large.</p>

<p>I don't mean to offer online dreamsharing as better than off-line. I'd rather not set up a feeling of competition here; I personally love the physical embodiments of dream drama and the risky emotional contact and personal closeness of face-to-face meetings. This is just not available at this time on the Net. Rather, I'd like to present online dreamsharing as something new, opening a new niche, a new wavelength that is different from face-to-face dream sharing. Online dreamsharing complements and supports all other kinds of dream sharing through the more specific development of reflective skills and more general global dissemination of the benefits of communities tied together through the sharing of dreams. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oppression in art, as in life, is when the conclusion to be reached is predetermined by inner or outer a priori motives of how life or art ought to be.</em> -Robert Motherwell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Civilization has posed a difficult task for the dreamer. Born into a society where dreams are of little or no social importance, the dreamer is left with few ways to satisfy a very natural curiosity to learn what the dream is saying. The result is a kind of emotional ecological loss to society, one in which so valuable a resource has gone unappreciated. Some day someone like Rachel Carson may come along to alert us to the price we are paying for this neglect. The repair will depend on the honesty with which we can face up to the general historical developments that have led up to this state of affairs and the current sociocultural forces that perpetuate it.</p>

<p>I won't say much about the general factors. They are well known to us all. Setting ourselves apart from nature our efforts have been devoted to a mastery over nature, including our own human nature. In savaging nature, we ourselves have become an endangered species, if not physically, then in terms of our obvious failure to nurture and cherish every human being that lands on this planet. Instead of facilitating a spirit of connectedness, without which we cannot endure as a species, our rugged individualism has left the devil to take the hindmost. Nationalism, having outlived its usefulness, now stands in the way of repairing the fragmentation the human species has been subjected to down through the ages. Our dreams and the concern they show for the state of our connectedness to others and to ourselves can make no claim of importance in this outworn scheme of things. They await a new day.</p>

<p>As individuals we cannot easily resolve any of these general issues in the near future. We can, however, do more with regard to the specific issues that make it difficult to open the closet door. There are a number of hidden assumptions that perpetuate this difficulty. For the most part they derive from the lingering influence of a mystique that has grown up about dreams as a consequence of the foothold that classical psychoanalysis established in this country in the thirties. With that came an ideology that cast the dream in a light that all but made it forbidden territory to the ordinary mortal. To undo this inhibitory impact we have to see it for what it is and take what steps we can to bring forth a new and more felicitous vision of the gift our dreaming psyche offers so freely.</p>

<p>Jung took the first step in this direction. The respect he showed to the dream freed it from its regressive prison, got rid of its jailor in the form of the censor, and made for its freer existence beyond the limiting domain of wish fulfillment. It is Jung's vision of the dream rather than Freud's that attracts the attention of the current generation of dream explorers. Erich Fromm accorded the language of the dream its full due. In a clear break with the way the dream was enmeshed in the Oedipus myth and other facets of Freudian theory, he viewed the imaging mode of the dream as a unique and distinctively human attribute that creatively reflected the psychological forces that impinge on our lives. Although paving the way toward a broader usage of the dream outside the framework of therapy, the steps necessary to implement that usage was a task for a later generation of dream workers.</p>

<p>In sum, the mystique of dreams in the mind of the public included the regressive view of the dream, the dream as the container of a cauldron of id impulses that threaten to erupt unless properly censored, the predominant role of wish fulfillment and sexuality, and finally, the need for someone psychoanalytically trained to interpret the resulting symbolism along tracks laid out by psychoanalytic theory. There have been major revisionist theories in psychoanalysis over the years that have moved away from the overarching role Freud attributed to instinctual drives and childhood wishes. These new approaches continued, however, to foster the cult of the expert and perpetuated the idea that formal therapy provided the only safe and effective way for the dreamer to engage with the dream. To challenge the premises underlying this mystique was to court danger. While theory may be helpful to a clinician as a way of highlighting trends in the developing life history of the patient, it can often be misused when it comes to dreams.</p>

<p>Viewing the metaphorical imagery in the framework of a particular theoretical orientation tends to foster an a priori approach to the imagery, the very thing Motherwell warns about.</p>

<p>The thrust of my professional endeavors for over three decades has been to do what I can to dismantle this mystique. In concert with a number of other workers I have addressed the general public concerning my conviction that access to dreams should be made available to all and I have suggested ways of approaching the task. The mystique I referred to is blind to the basic premise of this approach, namely, that dreaming is a universal phenomenon and should be universally accessible. It does not take into account the natural curiosity we all have about our dreams, a curiosity that betrays our intuitive sense that our dreams have something of importance to say to us. There is an active resistance by many therapists to what they correctly see as an attempt to deprofessionalize dream work. Having established a beachhead in the minds of the public that it requires an expert to decipher the symbolism of dreams, they have thus far been reluctant to forgo their privileged position.</p>

<p>If we were to project a utopian vision in which society were to give full cognizance to the healing potential of our dreams, what steps are within our power now to move toward that ideal? A first step would be to bring dream work into the educational system, beginning at the grade school level and making it an intrinsic part of the educational process at all levels. A few adventurous souls have experimented with this in the lower grades with encouraging results. I have had some experience with it at the high school level and, despite the special problems adolescents have about revealing their inner selves to their peers, I felt dream work was feasible and could be particularly helpful during this critical phase of development. Richard Jones pioneered a productive approach to dream work at the college level. In his book, The Dream Poet, he describes his experience of integrating what he refers to as "dream reflection" into a course on literature. As the students became familiar with the unique and expressive metaphors they were creating in their dreams, they not only responded more deeply to the classics they were reading, but their own writing became more original and more powerful than what might have been expected from their grade level (second year students). Similar work has been taken up at a number of different colleges. Edward Storm, a professor of computer science, brought dream work into a beginning course in computer science as a way of introducing students to the nonlinear analog attributes of dream thought. Important as these efforts are, they were nowhere on a scale commensurate with the educational potential that would accrue from an integration of dream work into the college curriculum.</p>

<p>It is time for the dreamers of the world to unite and break the theoretical chains that bind them to the cult of the expert and makes them passive participants in maintaining the mystique. What are dreamers being exhorted to do? First and foremost is to assume some responsibility to change the situation. This will involve both a program of education and of action.</p>

<p>Basic dream work should and can be taught outside of any particular theoretical frame of reference. I stress what I consider to be the three important phenomenological features of dreaming consciousness, namely, the relevance of its content to current issues in our lives, the retrieval of information from the past that is emotionally linked to these current concerns and finally, the profoundly honest way our feelings come through in the imagistic narrative we compose.</p>

<p>The dream presents a dreamer with the opportunity to move into the "becoming" aspect of his or her life. This entails certain unknowns and will often challenge a pre-existing emotional status quo. A dream, arising out of an unconscious domain, is now a challenge to the dreamer in the waking state. We are dealing with a raw product created primarily to meet the needs of the sleeping organism. A fish pulled out of the sea has to be cooked. A dream surfacing in the waking state has to be worked on for its message to be brought to life. For this the dreamer needs help in the form of a supportive and stimulating social context. That help is needed in the translation of the pictorial language and needs support in the owning of its content. Few of us can be as consistently honest with ourselves in the waking state as we are when we confront the imagery of the dream. Dream work flourishes in a group arrangement where everyone, including the leader, participates in every aspect of the process, including the sharing of dreams. A flat, nonhierarchical structure results. This, in conjunction with the fact that the dreamer is respected as the guardian of his or her unconscious and is the sole determinant of the level of self-disclosure, generates the sense of trust essential to the pursuit of so intimate and private an experience.</p>

<p>One way to approach understanding dreaming consciousness is to consider the way it differs from waking consciousness in both the language or form of the mode of communication and the nature of the content being communicated. The form is strikingly different from our waking thoughts. We move into a concrete sensory mode predominantly but not exclusively visual, and endow the imagery with the metaphorical power to reflect the subjective aspects of current concerns. We spend a good part of our sleeping time manufacturing visual metaphors that tell us how we really feel about ourselves, about others and about the immediate predicament we find ourselves in. If we are able to spark across the metaphorical gap and retrieve this content while awake, we become more truly in touch with ourselves. Our nighttime images are perceived as real at the moment. Their metaphorical power comes to light only when we take the time to explore their reference to our life. The waking discovery of the relevant life experience completes the metaphor.</p>

<p>Let us look more closely at the language of the dream. Once we free a dream from any extrinsic and superimposed theoretical considerations we are free to examine that imagistic language in its pristine state. When we go to sleep we shift from discursive speech to what I have referred to as metaphorical imagery in motion. We adopt the persona of the poet in a way that reflects the idiosyncratic emotional currents and express them not in words but in images that are uniquely our own. Regardless of how uncreative we may consider ourselves to be in our waking lives, the poet in each of us comes to life when we are asleep and dreaming. Unlike the poet who rearranges words in the search for the apt metaphor, we pictorially rearrange bits and pieces of our past experience and cultural heritage. We create visual metaphors that speak so precisely and so eloquently to whatever it is that we are feeling at the time.</p>

<p>The dream, in effect, is an aesthetic response to our predicament. I do not mean to imply that a dream is a work of art despite the fact that many dream images may be intrinsically beautiful and could become a work of art were they to be transformed into one or another enduring medium of expression. A work of art involves a good deal of energy and effort, sometimes extending over periods of time before it comes together in any final form. By way of contrast, the final product, the dream, appears spontaneously. No self-consciously directed energies are involved. It appears as part of a natural rhythm that occurs during sleep, a rhythm rooted in evolutionary processes. Once the dream is made to reveal its secret, its own internal logic becomes obvious. Then, and only then, can we appreciate how directly and precisely apropos it is as a carrier of immediate felt concerns.</p>

<p>In using the term secret, I do not wish to imply that a dream always has a secret to reveal. Sometimes it is quite transparent. There are many instance when solutions to problems and inventive ideas appear in a dream and are grasped immediately. More often than not the dreamer, on awakening, has only a limited access to his or her own creation, and sometimes none at all.. The greater our sense of metaphor, the more we might be able to connect with the imagery. The difficulty does not lie in the metaphorical language per se but, rather, in what that language is saying. Awake, we are not always as prone to the same level of honesty as we are while dreaming. As actors in the social scene, our unconscious defenses take over in the interest of maintaining our social persona. While awake, expediency often replaces candor in our efforts to protect a self-image. We have ways of not seeing what we don't wish to see. While dreaming we see what is really there to be seen.</p>

<p>The REM or rapid eye-movement stage of sleep and the associated episodes of dreaming are anything but a phylogenetic atrophic remnant like the appendix. By exposing predicaments arising defensively out of expediency or simply out of ignorance, this unique form of consciousness sounds a clear moral tone. Were we to take seriously the need to learn how to close the gap between image and reality we could benefit from the truth being exposed. Dreams are an ally in the effort to extend our range of moral freedom in the choices we are called upon to make.</p>

<p>Here I have to turn to moral philosophy for help. The point of view I have found most congenial in sorting out the issues involved is that of Mary Midgley. If I read her correctly, she buttresses common sense (it is in our nature to want to be more moral than otherwise) with Darwin's theory of evolution. She rejects any fatalistic view of human nature and links freedom to morality but not in any idealistic sense. Moral choice is contextual and linked to the specific circumstances and constraints in which that choice arises. The important point is that the choice is always there whether we know it or not. The constraints arise out of our individual life history and endure to the extent they are reinforced by existing social and institutional arrangements.</p>

<p>I am, in effect, postulating that we all possess an incorruptible core of being that makes its presence felt while dreaming, more dependably than while awake. I have referred to it as an ethical aperture, likening it to the aperture of a camera which opens more widely in the dark (asleep and dreaming). The aperture itself cannot ensure a good picture, but if properly set it allows for the best possible picture to emerge given the circumstances under which the picture is taken. Analogously our dream enables us to discern more clearly the circumstances involved and degree of freedom we have in making a moral choice. The dream aperture automatically sets itself to provide the information needed to ferret out the most moral choice available. It is up to us to develop the picture and do the work necessary to become conscious of that choice. The dream itself cannot make us do it. Our dreams are not enforcers.</p>

<p>Dreams have a range that takes into account the fact that the individual is a point of concentration of a complicated array of social forces, many of which operate outside of awareness. Just as personal referents in the dream reflect issues unique to the dreamer, social referents reflect issues that remain unsolved in a given society. Racism, sexism, ageism and other isms are still with us. Swept under the rug, they find their way into our dreams.</p>

<p>In the following example a blatantly sexist childhood casts a long shadow:</p>

<p>A woman in her late thirties is about to embark on a new relationship. She feels some hesitancy and has a dream that displays some of the roots of her ambivalence. At one point in the dream she sees her father sitting on a swing with four female relatives, all in their heyday, dressed almost like cancan girls. What emerged from the dream work were two powerful memories that surfaced from her childhood to influence her approach to a new relationship. One was that of the male, derived from the image of her father, as privileged to flirt and play around with other women. The other was that of the female victimized by the profligate male, as her mother was. These are images that she is still struggling with. In a larger sense they relate to the residues of sexism. The privileged male and the victimized female are still available social stereotypes.</p>

<p>In the next example the dreamer identifies with the victims of racism in her own struggle against sexism. A very experienced and competent manager, her voice is rarely heard by the men above her.</p>

<p>Irma is a 50 year old white woman who presented a dream, the key features of which were that she was with a group of children and an African-American mother on a bus in which she tried out one of the seats in the back. A little boy was speaking to a man. His black mother was angry because she didn't want her black boy speaking with a white man who would be a bad influence.</p>

<p>Irma's thoughts centered around her identification with the strong black mother. Her recent relevant day residues arose out of events at her work place. She is in a middle management position. "Those above me have all the arrogance of 'the old boys club'".</p>

<p>Women were second class citizens in her childhood home, controlled by a very dominant father whose strict religious teachings drew a very sharp line between right and wrong. That line was more favorable to her brothers than to her.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my workplace I felt like the underdog. If I `speak up' maybe I will eventually learn that a strong voice will not always be perceived by men as aggressive. Being born 'black' I had to have the ability to contain myself and still struggle to maintain my self respect and respect for my ideas. I have felt an affinity to black women all my life.</p>

<p>The deeply felt mesh of the personal and the social was laid bare by the image of her taking a seat in the back of the bus. A current issue at work led back to her life long struggle to free her intelligence and spirit from the limiting structure of her family life as set down by her father. Her growing self-confidence enabled her to take a step that not only upset a given status quo, but led to her resignation and a successful venture on her own.</p>

<p>The identification of the social referents in their specific relevance to a recent issue at work makes the connection between the social and the personal explicit and reciprocal. The connection becomes reciprocal when insight into the social scene sets in motion the hope of coping with her own disenfranchisement. In her ruminations about the dream in the week after she presented it, she felt the plight of the African-American woman on the bus was a "parable for my entire life experience, oppressed as it was by the strict regime my father and his religious beliefs imposed on me."</p>

<p>Irma's final comment was about her identification with the black woman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like the idea that came up that I was born a black woman. It goes beyond the events of the past week. It goes back to my relationship with my father.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the extent we remain unaware of the power of such internalized prejudices, our moral freedom is compromised. Any threat to moral freedom is ultimately a threat to enduring and collaborative ties among the constituents of a given order. We are members of a species that has survived thus far by virtue of our social attributes. If those attributes continue to deteriorate and we fail to reverse the moral morass growing so alarmingly at a community, national and international level, we are in for a difficult time in ever unifying the human species.</p>

<p>Our dreams thus serve a dual purpose. Their personal referents speak to the emotional baggage we carry around from our childhood. The social referents speak to the way certain social arrangements and institutions constrain our lives. One of the pitfalls common to industrial societies is the tendency to reduce human beings to objects, the personal attributes of which are useful in the marketplace. In the wake of recent examples of corporate psychopathy, workers thrown out of work come to the sudden realization they are no more than disposable objects.</p>

<p>In the following example, this "objectifying" trend is played out in the sexual life of a young woman:</p>

<p>When a woman dreams of a reference to her sexual organs as a head of lettuce encased in the empty shell of a cantaloupe sitting on the shelf of a supermarket she is saying something about her own personal sexual problem (frigidity) and, at the same time, making a statement about an aspect of social life. The personal referents arouse our interest, but the social referents are generally not pursued to any great degree. Briefly, the personal referents are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sexual organs are seen as separate from her functioning self.</p></li>
<li><p>Sexual organs are seen as objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The object is made of completely closed leaves encased in a shell.</p></li>
<li><p>The objects can be bought and sold.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an anonymity to objects on the shelf of a supermarket.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The real-life situation to which this symbolism alludes may be noted as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Involvement in a situation of incipient sexual activity that occurred apart from her own will and intent and at the instigation of her husband.</p></li>
<li><p>Reactions of irritation, guilt, and constraint.</p></li>
<li><p>A resolution through pseudo-acquiescence and preparatory sexual activity involving the use of a diaphragm.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The social referents may be similarly noted:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We live in a society where the capacities of people are sometimes treated as objects divorced from the person: labor, brains, beauty, talent, sex.</p></li>
<li><p>These separated capacities are bought and sold.</p></li>
<li><p>The exchange value and laws of the marketplace tend to make the transaction automatic and impersonal.</p></li>
<li><p>There exists in the nature of the external referents a detachment or separation of the individual from the commodity she is called upon to use. Her real relation to the commodity is determined by its manifest elements — the object exists as something apart from herself which may or may not be purchased.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our own humanity thrives best in an atmosphere of affectionate and cooperative ties to others. Dreams provide us with an opportunity to explore, understand and change whatever may be in the way of establishing such ties. In this respect I believe our dreaming consciousness goes beyond a concern for the individual and arises out of a more basic concern, namely, the survival of the species. One of the unfortunate byproducts of the historical evolution of human society is the enormous fragmentation that has occurred among members of the human species and the terrible tensions that have been associated with this fragmentation. We need only mention, as examples, religious, racial, sexual and economic class distinctions, in addition to accidents of geographical separation and differentials in cultural evolution.</p>

<p>While as individuals we may concern ourselves very little with the integrity of our connections with others, pursue an unsavory way of life, run roughshod over others and still live to a ripe old age, it is becoming more and more unlikely that we will survive as a species unless we can get our act together and learn how to surmount the historical fragmentation that has occurred. Dreams can provide us with one more tool in the struggle to repair and maintain that sense of species-connectedness so essential for our survival.</p>

<p>What is needed at present is a drastic revision of our view of the importance of our dream life. Dreams are very low in the list of social priorities. We do not introduce dream work into the family or educational system. As adults we are left to our own devices to satisfy our natural curiosity about our dreams. The only socially sanctioned arrangement for dream work is the therapeutic situation where we pay someone to help us with our dreams. All of us are dreamers and not all of us need therapy. Where can the rest of us go? Dream dictionaries? They are more often misleading than helpful.</p>

<p>The knowledge and skills necessary for effective and safe dream work can be identified and taught to anyone with sufficient interest. There is a growing awareness that this is so and that the time has come to open the door to the lay public. Were dream work to be socially upgraded and the proper arrangements made for extending it into the community we would not only provide the individual with a vehicle for personal growth but we might also catch a glimpse of the underside of our own social order and its emotional impact on each of our lives.</p>

<p>Cultural anthropologists have looked at dreams as mirroring aspects of primitive societies. We have hardly begun to scrutinize the influence of our own social order on our dreams. Were we to do so, I believe that interesting relationships would emerge. In preliterate societies today, for example, there is a niche for dreams as an important intermediary between cultural, religious, and historical influences on everyday life. In antiquity, notably classical Greece, this interest in dreams was also noted. In both instances, there was a certain symmetry between the personal and the social that served a unifying, cohesive function. The situation began to change in ancient Rome as monotheism took over. The link was finally severed in western Europe in the middle ages with the occurrence of two historical developments, the invention of the printing press and the consolidation of the power of the Church. The first made dream books, mostly oriented to mantic practices and divination, available to the laity. The second resulted in disparaging even to the point of proscribing the circulation of such books. In the eyes of the Church, mystical visions and dreams were linked.</p>

<p>Both could be the work of either divine or satanic influences. Since the laity could fall prey to the latter, it was felt that dreams and visions should remain under the domain of the Church as the only power that could vouch for authentic divine influences. This concern with the vulnerability of the laity to demonic influences ultimately led to the persecution of witches.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution marginalized dreams. It was the last blow to any hope that our dream life would find its own natural haven in society. Objective mastery of the external world far outstripped any realistic social investment in the subjective mastery of ourselves. Dreams had no significant social valence. With Freud the universal phenomenon of dreaming found a limited place for itself in a profession dedicated to the art of psychological healing. The public was left to shift for itself with regard to their dreams. Universal accessibility to something so insistently a part of everyone's life has remained a mirage for all but a handful of oneirophiles. In the laboratory we have learned how to deprive people of dreams by keeping them awake from the onset to the end of the successive stages of the dreaming cycle. Without giving it a second thought, we have managed to live out our lives in a dream-deprived society.</p>

<p>The closing decades of the last century witnessed the appearance of a truly new phenomenon, namely, people gravitating toward dream groups led both by professionals, including a scattering of psychoanalytically trained therapists, and laity. While at this point these groups are only barely visible dots on the landscape, there is every indication that this movement will grow. That growth will depend on how safe and effective these groups turn out to be. Currently, there are more people seeking such groups than there are groups to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Every member of our species is a dreamer. If dream work had a higher social valence than it now enjoys, might it, in the way it addresses the micro-level of individual relatedness, make a contribution toward remedying relatedness within the family and the community? Once dreaming consciousness is more generally recognized as constructively complementary to waking consciousness, and were that complementarity ever to gain a foothold in the public domain, it just might open up one more pathway to a more humane social order. There have been and still are societies that have integrated dream work into their culture.</p>

<p>In sum, our dreams, when consciously pursued, are a kind of emotional connective tissue bonding us as social animals. If we take the trouble to permit those nocturnal visitations to find their place in our waking world, they can provide us with a starting point in the continuing struggle to transcend our limitations. The nature of our interdependence is such that, as personal connections evolve more solidly, there are effects that reverberate upward toward ever larger social units. Dreams can point us in the right direction. They reveal our strengths, acknowledge our weaknesses, expose our deceits, and liberate our creativity. They deserve far greater attention than they now receive. As a psychiatrist, my concern is with personal truth. One road I have taken in pursuit of this has been to attempt to demystify dreams in a way that would make the personal honesty embedded in the metaphorical images of our dreams available to all. There should be universal access to the benefits that can accrue from them.</p>

<p>For too long the public has been taken in by the prevailing mystique that serious dream work had best be limited to the clinical domain. Our dreaming psyche arises out of an incorruptible core that, in contrast to our waking ego, has never lost sight of the fact that we are members of a single species. Our ability to endure as a species may depend on taking that fact more seriously than we have in the past. Dreams reveal the state of connectedness of the individual to his or her past, to others, and to the supports and constraints of the social order. Is it too much to hope that, as we move into a postindustrial society, the intrinsic honesty of dreams can be harnessed to this effort?</p>

<p>We are in need of a politics of connectedness. The growing interest in the healing potential of our dream life holds out the hope we may eventually reach the goal of matching our biological unity as a species with a cultural reality of communion and brotherhood. My point is not that dreams will save us from ultimate disaster but they can, if taken seriously, be one among many countervailing efforts.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>What? The president of an international dream association is telling us not to interpret our dreams? Banish him to the tower immediately!</em></p>

<p>Wait! Let me explain. </p>

<p>When referring to dreamwork, I have trouble with the term, “interpretation,” as it implies determination of a finite “meaning” and we all know dreams carry multiple meanings. I don’t think the purpose of dreamwork is interpretation, but many people come to dream groups expecting their dream to be “interpreted,” suggesting that there is just one explanation for the dream – and that the dream is meant just for them. </p>

<p>In an open dream group I led in Asheville, North Carolina people dropped in and shared dreams that amazed and perplexed them. Of course the next words out of their mouths were, “What does it mean?” The group would spend the next hour or so laboriously “working” each dream and the dreamer usually left with some degree of satisfaction in regard to what the dream was about. That was the conclusion of their experience. </p>

<p>Most of these people had little interest in learning how to work on their own dreams such as starting a journal or studying their dream history. They represent many who have dreams that pique their curiosity, but would prefer others to tell them what they mean. Some are even willing to pay a few dollars to an “expert” or skim through a dream dictionary to gain insight. </p>

<p>When doing dreamwork, I prefer the term, “exploration.” I see our roles as dream facilitators or group members as ones who explore a dream in an effort to help the dreamer attain self-discovery. In group settings, exploration is magnified and multiplied. When shared, one person’s dream does not belong to that person alone but takes on its own life within each member of the group.</p>

<p>I tell my groups that a dream is brand new when it occurs in sleep and is again brand new when it is told. Each person hearing it is creating a version of the dream and it is no longer one dream, but many. In other words there is a new dream being dreamed at that moment by each person in the room as well as each person in their families, co-workers or social network friends – and each one grows from the insight of the one dream captured by one person. </p>

<p>In effect, we are not interpreting a dream, but we are opening up multitudes of possibilities for the dreamers exposed to it. I don’t call my groups dream analysis or dream interpretation groups, but rather dream study groups. We study. We explore. We experience the dream. And we each benefit from that experience. </p>

<p>Every person who hears a dream becomes a facilitator; one who serves the dreamer by listening and attempting to understand the aspects of the dream without projecting or “interpreting” it for the dreamer. During the process the veils of confusion are removed and both the dreamer and the facilitator begin to appreciate the blessings the dream has to offer. </p>

<p>To avoid projection and the danger of “telling” someone what a dream means when providing personal insight, many dreamworkers begin with the phrase, “If this were my dream....” That is, if this were my dream it would have this or that meaning or this symbol would mean such and such to me. In order to totally avoid the possibility of projection I prefer, “In my version of the dream …” By saying this, I take ownership of the dream and am less likely to project based on prior knowledge I may have of the dreamer. In this respect I am more likely to deal solely with the dream itself. </p>

<p>During a dinner party in my home, a woman at the table told an incredible dream about sheep. When she was done, everyone looked at me, as if they expected me to immediately know what the dream “meant.” Knowing my in-depth involvement with dreams, they expected me to be an “expert.” I told them I didn’t have the slightest idea what that dream meant. I took solace remembering an incident Robbie Bosnak wrote about in his book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>. As I recall, after a client of his told a dream, he broke into a cold sweat acknowledging to himself that he didn’t have any idea what it meant. I felt comforted knowing that this man, who does dreamwork for a living, goes through the same anxiety I do when expected to “interpret” a dream. </p>

<p>When first told, the dream is a mystery. Its meaning is as unknown to the listener as it is to the dreamer. But as we venture into that unknown, peeling away layer after layer, examining the details, identifying the characters and action sequences of the story - exploring deeper and deeper - the messages the dream is attempting to convey become apparent. For instance, as I delve into a dream about a bear invading my camping space, I may see it as asking me to think about how I deal with conflict or potential conflict, what choices I am making (such as facing fear or running away) or simply how I deal with unexpected consequences. Perhaps all are true. Ultimately, I come to realize there is no fi nite meaning, but infi nite possibilities. </p>

<p>Instead of using the terms dream interpretation or analysis, I support exploration. By steering away from what a dream “means,” (since all dreams have multiple meanings), we can embrace what the dream is asking us to do - to face the critical issues in our lives so we can advance and grow. They ask us the questions we need to address, and rather than giving us direct answers, they guide us to the next question. If we just decide, “this dream means this or that,” we are likely to just say, “Since I know what that dream means, I don’t need to explore it any further,” and we fail to experience the full richness of the dream. </p>

<p>Analysis leads to knowledge. True wisdom comes from being in a space of “not knowing.” ℘ </p>

<p>It is truly a pleasure and a privilege to be here tonight. This is a very new experience for me, so please be patient as I get adjusted to being up here.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I'd like to thank all of the people who have encouraged me.  I'm not going to mention names, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the dreamers, writers, artists, poets, previous editors, everybody who has helped to keep the spirit that manifests as the publication Dream Network alive over the past 14 and a half years. Quite honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed a bit right now. I have “as has been true with Will” known many of you for so long and yet am just tonight meeting you in person for the first time.  Additionally, I've never done anything like this before.  This is a first time, initiatory, trial-by-fire experience, and I ask your patience and your good energy.  And if you give that to me, you may be in for a little show, because I have a tendency to speak as much with my hands and my body as I do with my voice. So c'mon, I'll provide you with some entertainment!</p>

<p>I want to begin tonight by sharing a piece that was given to me by a poet friend some years ago.  It was a piece read at a meeting of the New Latin American Poets in Mexico City some time ago. The author is unknown.  But it's a piece that I believe holds the essence of the spirit of the dream movement, and is a credo that we've adopted among those people who are networkers within the context of the Dream Network.  I then want to spend the majority of the time introducing those of you who aren't familiar with the publication and its history... to Dream Network by introducing previous editors and sharing a little bit about what we've been doing over the past 14 and a half years. I will conclude by sharing a piece that I've written about dreams and exploring the mystery.  So to begin, I will read, if I may,</p>

<h2>A Message to Poets and Dreamers</h2>

<p>"We who are poets and dreamers know that the reason for a poem is not discovered until the poem itself exists.  The reason for a living act is realized only in the act itself.  This meeting is a spontaneous explosion of hopes.  That is why it is a venture in prophetic poverty, supported and financed by no foundation, organized and publicized by no official group, but a living expression of the belief that there are now in our world new people, new poets, new dreamers, who are not in tutelage to established political systems or cultural structures, but who dare to hope in their own vision of reality and of the future...</p>

<p>"This meeting is united in a flame of hope whose temperature has not yet been taken, and whose effects have not yet been estimated, because it is a new fire.  The reason for the fire cannot be apparent to one who is not warmed by it.  The reason for being here will not be found until all have walked together, without afterthought, into contradictions and possibilities...</p>

<p>"We believe our future will be made by love and hope, not by violence or calculation.  The Spirit that has brought us together, whether in space or only in agreement, will make our encounter an epiphany of certainties we could not know in isolation...</p>

<p>"The solidarity of poets and dreamers is not planned and welded together with tactical convictions or matters of policy, since these are affairs of prejudice, cunning, and design.  Whatever our failures, the poet and dreamer is not a cunning person.   His or her art depends on an ingrained innocence which he or she would lose in business, in politics, or in too organized a form of academic life.  The hope that rests on calculation has lost its innocence.  Let us band together to protect our innocence!" (end ‘Credo’)</p>

<p>That is called again, "A Message to Poets," author unknown, but very relevant, I believe, to the challenge that stands before us as we create new ways of recognizing that so many of the ways that we've been taught are not working for us any longer.</p>

<h2>History of Dream Network/Past Editors</h2>

<p>Now I want to talk about what I know of the history of the Dream Network.  There are many details that I don't know.  I was fortunate to be able to make contact with most of the previous editors and get statements from them and I'll be sharing those.  But, in essence, I do know that the publication was started with an intention to bring dreams back to dreamers, to acknowledge the fact that we've learned that we all dream every night, and that we have a right to learn, to understand, the symbolic and metaphoric language of dreams.  It was begun in the spirit of being a grassroots publication and it's remained that way over the past 14+ years.  And it couldn't have happened without, as Will said, the dedication and effort that so many people have put into it over the years.  At this point, if we could have the house lights out, we'd like to show a few slides to show the evolution of the publication over the years.</p>

<p>Dream Network was begun in January 1982 by a very fiery and compassionate young man by the name of Bill Stimson.  And I'd like to read... That's his picture there and that's the first issue of Dream Network.  And, in that issue he published an article that he wrote called, "Armed with our Dreams." I'd like to read just the last paragraph of that article:</p>

<p>"Armed with our dreams, we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around.  The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women.  To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness."</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote Bill and asked him if he'd be willing to share a few words and he was aware that I was going to be making this presentation.</p>

<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>

<p><em>"The Dream Network is not the publication; the enterprise proper isn't a publishing one. To speak the truth of what the Dream Network is about for us is to find our myth -- where else but among our dreams? -- for us to use our dreams in a way that enables us to come together honestly and deeply, for what was broken to be rendered whole again, our community with one another, our connection with our deeper selves, our oneness in purpose, our ability and our resolve to embody the light itself. What makes the Dream Network special is that it's fundamentally different.  People sense this somehow and so they've helped the energy and unfoldment move forward."</em></p>

<p>During Bill's time (and if you'd please show the next two slides, Will)... I don't understand the dynamics that were behind this, but there were different publications coming out in different parts of the country that were called Dream Network affiliate publications.  One of them was called Fusion.  I believe it came out of Seattle.  And there was another called DreamCraft, which came out of somewhere in the northeast.  I'm not certain about that, however.  There was a big stir of energy happening at that time.  One of my advisors and a very, very good friend, who is one that I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting in the flesh, is Barbara Shore.  And she was a part of the original New York dream community.  I wrote her and asked if she'd share some of her experiences from those early days. I think this might sound familiar to a lot of you because, I know in my own experience, when I first began having these incredible dreams, I didn't have too many places to turn and there wasn't a lot of information available to help me understand what was happening.  What Barbara has to say is,</p>

<p><em>"In my mind's eye is Bill Stimson's small, walk-up flat on a hot summer's night...the beginnings of the New York dream community.  We never formed a tight-knit group because the people kept changing too often for that.  The room was usually crowded...15 to 20 people.  Essentially, we knew nothing about dreams, but Bill's enthusiasm and passion for dreams was contagious. It was a dream whose time had come, like the classic dream of finding yourself in your own home but entering a new room that you've never been in before.  We were electrified.  This group was the core of the New York dream community and the New York dream community was the core of the early dream movement in the United States.  Although we couldn't articulate it at the time, I think we realized that we now had a mission in life. We were converts to dreams.  Was it Bill's vision of a global network of dreamers we were envisioning or did it arise spontaneously among us?  I don't know, but it was powerful.  When Bill got an idea, he didn't rest until he got it out there.  He was the prototype of the populist networker, the Trotsky of the dream revolution. It might have happened without him, but it never would have been so fast, so intense, so like a prairie fire in a season of drought.  Maybe this was the next step after the revolutionary 60's.  That world-changing vision hadn't fully worked, so maybe we had to go back to the inner drawing board, and remake the world from the individual psyche's infrastructure inside out, instead of the other way around."</em></p>

<p>Bill did the Dream Network; he was at that time putting it out monthly. It was a four to eight page bulletin.  And he did that for approximately two years, at which time it came into the hands and heart of Chris Hudson.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't contact...I couldn't locate Chris, so I don't have anything to share with you directly from him.  But I did meet him in my early days of work with the Dream Network, and want to share some of that meeting with you a little later on.  For this purpose, I'll say that I did get letters from people who have been long-time readers who made a lot of comments about their appreciation of Chris's willingness to share his own process, to share his own dreams during the years that he was editor and publisher.  And they also appreciated the very lively Letters to the Editor section that he introduced into the publication.</p>

<p>Chris was in Brooklyn and Henry and Bob Van De Castle are the people who took responsibility for the publication next, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>

<p>Once again I don't know any of the dynamics that occurred when the publication was making its moves around the country. But Henry and Bob have shared that even before the Dream Network appeared on the scene, Henry had published several issues of the "Sundance Community Dream Journal," which was the precursor to the Dream Network.  It was the first published journal declaring that dreams belong to dreamers.  The Sundance Journal and Henry's early efforts have had him dubbed "The Father of the American Dream Movement" in many circles.  Henry and his wife, along with Bob Van De Castle, took responsibility for the Dream Network in 1985, and during that time, Bob conducted a very successful dream telepathy experiment through the publication.  And Henry did a real interesting study on shoes as symbols in dreams.  Articles and his findings were published throughout the time that he and Bob were doing this.  I'm a little embarrassed and self-conscious because both Henry and Robert are sitting right here in front of me.  And I know that there are probably many things that I'm not saying. Would either of you like to make comments about your time? (Henry and Robert signal ‘no.’)</p>

<p>Okay. ... During the period of time that they were co-editing the publication, Bob was also serving as the president of ASD.</p>

<p>From their hands, in approximately 1987, it traveled into the hands and heart of Linda Magellon, here in nearby San Jose. Linda, who I don't believe is here tonight, (she said she had responsibilities elsewhere), had this to say,</p>

<p><em>"Dream Network Bulletin is a communal project.  It couldn't happen without the help of family, friends, and colleagues, without the assistance of volunteer staff, contributors, and subscribers.  Under my tutelage, the most important goal was to assure that new voices would be heard, new visions seen, especially those dreamers who'd not been previously published. They were nurtured and encouraged to dare to dream in the public forum."</em></p>

<p>Linda had a great deal of support as well from Bob Trowbridge and Jill Gregory, whom I know many of you are familiar with. It was during Linda's time that the publication first began to take on color. I think that if the right slide's up there, you're seeing the first issue that appeared with color on the cover.  </p>

<p>My Own History with Dream Network,</p>

<p>including a brief Dream autobiography</p>

<p>In 1989, literally on summer solstice, I was informed that the Bay Area Dream Workers had accepted my "bid," so to speak, to take responsibility for the publication.  And I'd like to go on kind of a diversionary path here for a moment and share a little with you about my history with dreams and my history with the Dream Network, because I recognize that I'm a stranger to most of you.  This is kind of a labyrinthical tale.  I hope you'll be able to follow along with me:</p>

<p>It starts back in 1975-76.  I was in a very, very busy part of my life, living in the Pacific northwest and working full time, raising my family, in a new marriage.  One afternoon on a weekend, I took a nap and had the most extraordinary dream that I'll probably ever have in my life. It is the first dream that I ever recall as an adult.  I remember dreams from my childhood but this one was like going to a full-length movie.  When I awakened, I went, "My goodness, what on earth was that?" I'd been keeping a journal for several years and I immediately wrote down every detail of that dream.  In the dream...</p>

<p>I found myself going into the community center where I was, actually where I actually worked, where my office was located.  It was a multi-service community center.  And rather than the typical kinds of activities that were taking place there on a day-to-day basis in waking reality, there were... Oh, as I was walking down the hallway... In this room there'd be dancers dancing, and in this room there'd be musicians playing, and in this room there'd be artists drawing...  And it was totally full of people who were doing all kinds of creative activities.  And as I went to the back of the building, into the area where (in daytime reality) there's a basketball court, there were groups of people working, constructing. I couldn't tell you what they were constructing, but they were using hammer and nails.  And every time, they were hammering in unison, and every strike of the hammer was in concert with music that was playing in the background.</p>

<p>It was just a lovely sight to see.</p>

<p>That's a part of the dream; that's the tone of the dream.</p>

<p>That particular dream must have carved some new pathways in my psyche, because it was at that point in time that I began dreaming and recalling my dreams prolifically.  I didn't know what was happening.  I was seeking out everything I could find.  That was not long after Patricia Garfield's and Ann Faraday's books had come out, and I found those, and found a Jungian who lived in the community and went and spoke with him, learned a few things from him, continued to dream...</p>

<p>Time went on, and in the fall of 1981, I was reading our local, weekly paper.  We had just elected a mayor in our community of Port Townsend who was a jazz pianist, and his wife was a flautist, and they were both very environmentally-conscious.  It was a very extraordinary and wonderful era in that community. He wrote a weekly column in the paper, and in August of 1981 his column said, "Is there anyone out there who'd be interested in coordinating an event to honor the 35th anniversary of the United Nations?"  For a number of reasons, which I won't go into now, I was compelled to respond to that call.</p>

<p>I called together a group of my colleagues.  We had a meeting, literally at the office where I worked in the community center. And as we were brainstorming ideas about what would we do in our small little backwater town to acknowledge the United Nations anniversary, I began getting a full-blown memory of the dream that I'd had back in '75-76, and I said that to the group.  I said, "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!"  And one man said, "Well, we've got to do it then."  Thank God!  I mean he just picked right up on it.  There wasn't a beat that was skipped before he said that.  Each of us took a piece of the work away from that meeting and proceeded to coordinate this event, which occurred on October 11, 1981. The entire event, itself, was like walking through the dream that I'd had five years ago, step by step by step.  There were no details missing.  I was existing for that time, at that intersection between the dream reality and this reality, off the ground. It started at noon and continued until two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>In some of the rooms we had arranged that artists would be there drawing portraits.  We had arranged in other rooms that there would be international foods available. In other rooms, we arranged that there would be information booths sharing news from countries in which there were concerns like apartheid, and so forth.  And, in the back room, we had a program later in the evening that went on and on and on. It just did not want to end until it finally did at two or three in the morning with Sufi dancing. It was just an absolutely wonderful and very successful event.</p>

<p>It was at that time that I knew something of extraordinary significance had just taken place and, on some level, a commitment was made in my soul to learn more, to understand more. At the same time, I'm still in this busy part of my life where there wasn't a lot of opportunity to seek out information.... and there wasn't a lot of information available.</p>

<p>Well, not long after that event happened, I had a visit from a friend -- a woman poet  -- by the name of Christina Pacosz.  She had been published a few times in the publication.  And she came to me to ask, to tell me that she had just received a letter from a man in New York City who had just started a publication called the Dream Network Bulletin.  And he had asked her to find someone in the northwest area to, what her words were, "to focalize dreamwork."  And she said, "You're it."  And she gave me the letter and encouraged me to write him.  I sat down immediately after she left and wrote Bill Stimson a letter and sent a picture of myself off to him in New York.  Fortunately, I kept a copy, I don't know why, but I made a copy of that letter before I sent it off.  But I never got a response. It just felt, after two or three, four months went by, like it had gone off into a black hole in space.</p>

<p>So once again back to the, you know, 8 to 5.  I'm back to work. This event that I just talked about, the poet coming to me, happened in the fall of '82, and I don't remember much, because I was still in that hurricane of work and family and so forth until the fall of 1987, when the harmonic convergence occurred on August 17.  I'd been carrying that date forward in my journal for about 20 years, because I thought it was going to be the magic moment, you know, the ‘blink of an eye’ that we’re all waiting for. And I was invited to a number of different events that were happening to acknowledge that occurrence, but decided to go to a place nearby Boise, Idaho, to an event that was called, "Dancing the Dream Awake." It was sponsored by Brook Medicine Eagle, and it was an all-night dance/ritual around the fire to acknowledge and celebrate the beginning of this period that we're in the midst of right now.</p>

<p>After returning from that event, I can only say that things began to change very rapidly in my life.  It wasn't very long before I decided to let go of a 20-year career as a public servant, in a wide variety of very interesting jobs.  I was very fortunate, but it was time to let go.  I wasn't certain what I was going to do, but I knew that it had to have to do something with dreams.  I needed to learn more.  And so what I did was apply to a graduate degree program that I had found that would allow me the opportunity to co-create, with my committee and faculty people, a study plan that met my needs.  And I found that program and was accepted. It was Vermont College, at Norwich University. In the early stages of that program, one of my first responsibilities was to meet with my committee and faculty people for the purpose of designing the study plan.  That process took place in California, in the spring of 1989. I went to Southern California and developed the plan.  We worked over a period of two or three weeks.  I got my study plan approved.</p>

<p>At that time, I had moved back to my home state, Utah.  When it was time to leave California, which is a two-day trip, I took a different route than I normally do, and stayed on the west side of Hopi land.  I was on a Navajo reservation, that night staying in a Navajo-owned motel. I want to back up just one minute and tell you that, while I was in the process of developing this study plan, I had relocated the Dream Network.  I had found out it was being published out of San Jose and subscribed while I was in California.  So the night that I'm staying at the motel on Navajo land, west of the Hopi reservation, I had a dream.</p>

<p>In the dream, I saw  papers hanging from the branch of a tree, blowing in the wind, and heard a voice say, "If you don't do it, somebody else will." I woke up and wondered, "What on God's green earth could that possibly mean?"  I had no idea.</p>

<p>I made my way home to Moab, Utah, which is where I've been off and on for the last 40 years.  Shortly after I got there, now with this new project, this new adventure before me, this new challenge of the graduate degree program, I was all ready to launch in it...  But not long after I got there, something occurred which is very typical in that part of the country, and it was a period of seven to ten days of absolutely relentless winds, 24 hours a day, just stirring up all of the sand in the desert, and making it virtually impossible to feel like you could complete a task in the way that you normally would, because it was very unnerving.</p>

<p>After two or three days of trying to accomplish something and being unsuccessful, I decided to stop trying and threw a few books and my journal in the day-pack, and walked up a canyon, a very beautiful canyon that I live near, and spend the day in a cave, a beautiful cave...In fact, a cave that I was guided to in a dream some years before.</p>

<p>On my way up the canyon, I stopped at my mailbox and, lo and behold, there was my first issue of the Dream Network Bulletin!  It had just arrived and so I put it in my day-pack, headed up the canyon, got about half way up the trail (it was going to be a mile, mile and a half, before I got to the cave)and I heard a voice say, “You’re going to see a snake.”... then immediately, a snake slithered across the trail. I said thank you to the voice,  hello to the snake and went on my way.</p>

<p>When I got to the cave...  (it's a beautiful cave. If you ever come to Moab, please look me up.  I'll take you there.  You won't believe it.  It's absolutely gorgeous!) ...and I  took everything out of my day-pack.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was grab the new issue of Dream Network, open it at random, and the first thing I saw was the graphic image of an eye with a snake coiled in the pupil, and it just...goosebumped me!  Ah, I'll never forget that moment.  I knew something was about to happen, and when I turned just inside the front cover, the words that my eyes fell on were,</p>

<p>"This publication is seeking a new Editor/Publisher."</p>

<p>Well, I threw everything right back in my day-pack, ran back home,  called Linda, and began communicating with her -- a communication that took place over a two or three month period of time, both by phone and letter.  As I said earlier, on summer solstice 1989, I was called by Linda and told that the Bay Area dreamworker’s group had agreed to pass the responsibility, the torch, and the beauty -- and what an adventure it is! -- on to me.</p>

<p>Not long after Linda informed me, she put out her last issue from San Jose. In it, she introduced me.  Shortly after that issue came out, I got a call from Chris Hudson, and here's where I'm going to go back to my story about Chris, because he had just moved from Brooklyn to Bellingham, Washington, very nearby where I was living, and was very excited that the publication was going to be happening so nearby him.  At that time, I was again in the northwest doing my graduate degree program. By the way, I know that part of my tale has got to be confusing because I was literally like a pinball, bouncing back and forth between the northwest and the southwest during this period of time. So don't get too confused.  I was on the Olympic Peninsula and back in Utah quite a number of times during that period. Chris called and wanted to come over and meet me.  So we agreed on a weekend, he came, and it was a very beautiful day. I had decided to suggest that we go to a beautiful park in Port Townsend to have our talk.  He was agreeable. So we went to Chetzemoka, got out of the car, began walking into the park, and Chris stopped in his tracks and said, "My God, I've got a picture of you sitting right over there in that flower garden."  And I said to him, "How could you have a picture of me sitting over there in that flower garden? We just met 15 minutes ago!"  And he proceeded to tell me that when responsibility for the publication was handed to him by Bill Stimson, that there were a good number of unopened pieces of mail.  Among them, the letter that I had sent to Bill back in 1982, which contained my picture.</p>

<p>One gets a feeling of a certain amount of destiny when these kinds of things happen.</p>

<p>Evolution of Dream Network in current years</p>

<p>The next few slides are some pictures and images of the issues that have come out over the seven years that I've been doing the publication. During this past several years, we've evolved, naturally, a few new dimensions to the publication.</p>

<p>One of the first steps that I took was to develop a Council of Advisors, and I'd like to just name those people.  Many of you know some of them, and some of these people may be completely unfamiliar, but I really want to acknowledge them because they've been an incredible help and aid to me on so many occasions:  Kelly Hunter, she's from the east coast; Stanley Krippner, most of you know; Marcia Lauck, who is here in San Jose and co-author of "At the Pool of Wonder"; Will Phillips, who you all met a short while ago; Bill Schuman, from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Barbara Shor, from New York City; and Graywolf/Fred Swinney, from southern Oregon.</p>

<p>There have been other individuals who have served during my time that include Montague Ullman, Jeremy Taylor, Deborah J. Hillman, and all of whom really taught me a lot and helped a great deal during the period of time that they served in that capacity.  We also made a decision to focus each issue around a question or a theme and that seems to have worked very well.  It narrows the focus so that we aren't wandering too far over creation.</p>

<p>We've developed a statement of purpose.  I'd like to read just an excerpt of that for you:</p>

<p>"Our purpose is to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams.  We seek to disseminate information that will assist and empower us in taking responsibility for our  cultural, emotional and spiritual well-being, with the help of dreams and mythology.  Our goals are to unite and serve those who respect dreams, to empower dreamers in demystifying dreamwork, and to assist with the integration of dreamsharing in our culture, in whatever way of integrity is shown and given us.”</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, we've activated the title of the publication by encouraging committed and knowledgeable dreamworkers around the country...and in  Canada, France,  Germany, South Africa... to become listed in each issue as Networkers/Contact Persons.  Over 50 individuals are listed in each issue of the Dream Network, and are there to respond to your calls, your questions, your needs, to point you to resources, to point you to existing dream groups or help you form dream groups.  So those individuals are listed, and willing to share and make the path a lot smoother for new seekers than it was for us.</p>

<p>We've also evolved from what was a 24-page publication to 52 pages.</p>

<p>We've currently developed a presence on the World Wide Web - that's been an incredible experience to say the least.</p>

<p>We've begun just recently accepting advertising.</p>

<p>We created one subject-specific booklet that's composed of articles drawn from our very rich archives.  The one that is now published is, "The Art of Dreamsharing and Developing Dream Groups."  And we hope to publish a series of booklets bringing forth so many of these beautiful words of wisdom and experience, and articles that have only really been seen by a small handful of people over this last 14 and a half years.</p>

<p>And lastly, we're being distributed nationally on a relatively small basis, but nevertheless, being distributed nationally.</p>

<p>I'd like to close by reading and sharing some of what I've learned over this past seven years, and something else that I believe that we all have in common:</p>

<p><strong>Exploring the Mystery of Dreams</strong></p>

<p>Together we have learned that dreams constitute a field of</p>

<p>meaning and purpose as vast and complex as our knowledge</p>

<p>of the known universe. </p>

<p>We know that, although we're just becoming reacquainted,</p>

<p>other cultures and civilizations in the world have valued,</p>

<p>cherished, utilized, and manifested dreams and visions for centuries. </p>

<p>Many have been persecuted over the past 20 centuries</p>

<p>for doing the work we share today. </p>

<p>Like mercury, the field of dreams is elusive,</p>

<p>a mystery, expansive, ever evading definition,</p>

<p>description, categorization,</p>

<p>and forever earning our respect.</p>

<p>I believe we all agree that dreams are meaningful and purposeful.</p>

<p>We know that we all dream every night,</p>

<p>in fact many dreams each night.</p>

<p>Not all of our dreams are recalled,</p>

<p>and not all that are recalled can be readily</p>

<p>comprehended or shared with another.</p>

<p>We know dreams are essential and vital tools in therapy,</p>

<p>still they can be engaged in silence,</p>

<p>in our journals, with our spouse, our children, our neighbors,</p>

<p>in dream groups, because we know we all dream every night.</p>

<p>We have learned that dreams can be incubated to solve problems,</p>

<p>answer questions, provide guidance.</p>

<p>Dreams often give timely warnings for ourselves or for another.</p>

<p>Dreams provide insight, bring darkness into light.</p>

<p>Dreams awaken us, frighten us, shake us up,</p>

<p>puzzle and perplex us, allow us to waken within them. </p>

<p>And, if we're inclined, to control them.</p>

<p>We can meet together in the dreamtime reality,</p>

<p>a time and space beyond time-space.</p>

<p>In dreams, we can fly or die, and be reborn.</p>

<p>Dreams show us the future, shed light on the past,</p>

<p>even past lives.</p>

<p>In dreams, we're often prepared for the death of a loved-one,</p>

<p>and there is provision of ground for contact with them</p>

<p>from the other side.</p>

<p>Dreams are known to have been the catalyst for authoring books,</p>

<p>composing music,</p>

<p>creating new inventions,</p>

<p>inspiring poetry,</p>

<p>creating art and sculpture.</p>

<p>Dreams prophesize.</p>

<p>Dreams are spirits' way of speaking to us.</p>

<p>Dreams heal.</p>

<p>In one word, dreams Reveal.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><!--nopreview--><h2>The birth of my new dream-inspired song</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>This song and the fact that I chose to record it are inspired by a number of dreams. I have experienced many dreams spread over a couple decades that encourage me to record and share more music. Many such dreams involve various famous musical artists. These come at least monthly, sometimes weekly, and occasionally more often. I am lucky to be amongst the tiny percentage of people whose dreams include music and sound. </p>

<p>My newly released song <em>“Lucid (Never Felt As Good)”</em> was originally inspired by a music-only dream where I “received” the lyrics and melody from the song’s opening line and chorus. Just before I awaken, I clearly hear a disembodied voice singing, <em>“Wherever I’ve been in my life, I’ve never felt as good as when I’m with you.”</em> This type of dream melody with lyrics is not unusual for me, but I liked the tune and decided to experiment with it on guitar. Within a few weeks, I composed more lyrics and created a chord pattern and song structure around the dream melody. That was the easy part. </p>

<p>Then came another dream, again music only: <em>I hear the last few notes of the song’s guitar solo bridge as a distorted electric guitar.</em> Again no visuals, but what seems to me a clear suggestion from the muse to switch the feel from acoustic/folk to more rock and roll, especially for the solo. The sound of the electric guitar solo in the recording is much like I heard it in the dream. I recorded the song with friends but the quality was low. Dreams urged me to again record more music and I decided to revisit this song since I felt it was kind of catchy. The recording-arranging process spread over 10 months. In that time, I had multiple dreams encouraging me to continue recording and arranging it. Towards the end of arranging, I had a breakthrough evening where I found the sound I was looking for. I went to sleep very late, but happy. In the morning, I had what felt like a celebration dream: </p>

<p>*A spiritual teacher of mine is strolling along the red carpet. Waking, the dream feels related to the song. *</p>

<p>A week or so later, when I was having trouble blending the mix, another dream came: </p>

<p><em>I’m with my sister at the breakfast table, listening to the current mix with her. It seems that the mixing process is dragging on far too long on the last few notes. I am also shocked to hear that the drums and guitar arrangement has been changed and now sounds quite heavy metal, though it sounds good in an unusual way. At that point, I decide not to change the arrangement any further.</em></p>

<p>Within a couple weeks of completing the recording, Grace has blessed this song with air play on about 150 radio stations so far and I am very grateful. </p>

<p>Among other music I’ve composed, dreams also inspired the recording of my fun environmental song Polymers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU</a></p>

<p>Life has now blessed me with well over a thousand lucid dreams, so to share some of the dream and lucidity skills and insights that have come my way, I lead lively online interactive teleclasses about how to harvest dreams for creativity (music, art, inventions, film etc.), healing, life path guidance, spiritual growth, adventure, etc. ℘ </p>

<p>The phenomenon of flying in one's sleep is truly a miracle. If, as they say, ontogeny recapitulates philogeny, then consider the premise that we are all, at some time in our primal development. equipped with tail, gills and wings and all other aspects of an the creatures that live in air and water, especially fish and birds. The fact that dreamers can fly and breathe underwater as well as free fly in their sleep without any previous instruction or practice may be related to this innate, though undeveloped, potential.</p>

<p>For some years I have been collecting flying dreams. Everywhere I go I ask people how they fly. I want to include in this book a few of the interesting reports I've received, both to encourage dream flyers to share their adventures and to inspire others, especially those timid dreamers who have never experienced free flying, to try to relax and develop your will to fly.</p>

<p>The styles of flying are far more numerous than I ever imagined. They include flapping, soaring, sitting, lying, swimming, flopping, breast and butterfly stroking, dolphin kicking, whale tail snapping, and the yoga sit style of flying. </p>

<p>Then we have ASSIST FLYING: people empowered to fly holding a stick, a magic wand, or by riding a refrigerator, bed soaring, carpet flying, floor grabbing, back packing, and, most original, something called bloodpressure cuff pump flying. There is low and high altitude flying. Some can fly only a few inches off the ground. Some can do barn storming. A young woman says she flies, but never above the telephone wires. My son claims he's expert at indoor ceiling hovering. Some people jump to take off and fly at head height. Some fly at building height. Some are totally weightless for outer space flying. </p>

<p>We have human jet travelers and cosmic trans-gravity floaters. Some run on trans-spirit supersonic propulsion. Many hover out of their bodies. </p>

<p>Then there are just plain old fashioned BIRD flappers. Some have to make a great effort to stay up, while others rise off the ground at will. We even have those who fly in the body of another. </p>

<p>There are stories about effortless flight and stories of flight frustration. Some people go somewhere and others go nowhere. You can fly for joy or what one man calls efficiency flying; the only way to get there faster. Some dreamers are propelled by fear, called the fight or flight style. Some Guru followers know about spiritual transcendance, and a gal from California describes orgasmic cartwheeling. </p>

<p>We have stories of people who fly on air channels, people who FLY TO SEE and people who FLY TO FEEL. METHOD FLYING uses guide ropes or long stride takeoffs. Ordinary arm flapping is common, but fish tail flopping is rare. Some dreamers have to run in air or they can't stay up. One physicist uses the balling up method where he shoots through the atmosphere. A mathematician on my street does what he calls the tadpole wiggle. He says he can also sit on the back of a couch and slip out through the top of his head. Some of the experienced meditators say they do levitation rising. </p>

<p>Then there is intention flying versus guided imagining. I've got stories about losing power in midflight, as well as flying faster than light. One woman from the midwest says she flew to her father racing death, and was able to say good by before he died. Some dreamers tell about floating through walls, through floors and windows. They can float down stairs, or descend head first diving, spinning, dancing, with arms backwards and arms forward. Some have no arms at all. </p>

<p>Upside-down flying is more difficult, says a girl from New Hampshire, because you can't see where you are going at all. I'm waiting for more information about ecstatic flying orgasms. The girl who can bring them on at will says she has invented a dream pill and has a teachable Olympic routine of sexual acrobatics and tandem flying. </p>

<p>While presenting some dream programs for the "outer-most" listener supported radio station in Provincetown Mass., I received more contributions to my collection of flying dreams. I am fascinated by the variety of methods, positions, problems and adventures of those lucky dreamers who have the flying skill on command.</p>

<p>Dreams have long been a source of inspiration for musical composers of all genres. For example, Richard Wagner – who once wrote that “all poetry is only true dream interpretation” – recounted in his autobiography that he was unable to find a way to begin his gigantic Ring of the Niebelungen cycle when he had a dream in which he felt that he was drowning in overwhelming waves, while the figurations of an E flat major chord sounded in his mind. When he awoke, he realized that his dream had provided him with the opening of Das Rheingold, which is set at the bottom of the Rhine River. </p>

<p>When I proposed doing a symposium on music and dreaming to some colleagues at the 2010 IASD conference, what I had in mind to present was exploring how music finds its way into my dreams and how my unconscious mind is able to recognize musical themes and compositions. However, recent events in my dream life have transformed this study into an exploration of how music found its way out of my dreams and into a partially finished composition. </p>

<p>I have journaled my dreams for the past 19 years, using a database program that allows me to retrieve motifs with ease over the entire period. Out of a total of 9,696 recorded dreams, 332 contain the words “music” or “musical” – an average of 3.4% of the total. Over time, the number of musical dreams averaged 17.3 per year, and tended to increase to a peak in year 11 (2002-3), then to decrease to around the mean, and lastly to increase again sharply, starting in year 18 and continuing to the present (2009-11). (See Figure 1).</p>

<p>In addition to these two keywords, there have been numerous other occurrences of musical genres in my dreams. Music has always been a part of my life; I trained as a clarinetist from an early age and played in bands and orchestras through my second year in college. Over the past 9 years, as the result of a dream I reported in DNJV24#1, I have returned to instrumental practice on the crumhorn, a Renaissance double reed instrument ancestral to the oboe and the English horn. Mostly my interest is in classical music, but as Table 2 shows, both jazz and rock music appear in my dreams and are part of my waking appreciation, also. Missing from this list—and of less interest to me in waking life—are popular music, folk music, country, hip-hop, rap, and such genres. They do show up in my dreams, but more rarely. So, this listing somewhat parallels my musical tastes. However, as I do not consider myself to be a particularly good singer, it is a bit surprising that song shows up at the top of the list.</p>

<h3>Table 2: Genres (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Song – 100 <br>Performance – 96 <br>Tune – 86 <br>Symphony – 46 <br>Opera – 25 <br>Voice – 23 <br>Jazz – 20 <br>Concerto – 17 <br>Rock – 16 <br>Classical – 10 <br>Prelude – 10 <br>Overture – 7 <br>Duet – 7 <br>March – 7 <br>Hymn – 6 <br>Sonata – 6 <br>Composition – 6 <br>Trio – 5</p>

<p>Also, there have been a number of more technical musical terms appearing with some frequency in my dreams. These are shown in Table 3, and obviously reflect upon my familiarity with the language of music and its incorporation into my dream life.</p>

<h3>Table 3: Technical Terms (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-1.jpg" alt="Music" /></p>

<p>In addition, actions of a musical nature appear in my dreams, especially playing and singing. These are shown in Table 4. (This listing does not include any non-musical instances of these verbs, such as playing games, or conducting tours.) Though I am not a profi cient vocalist, once again, singing is high on the list. Composing is rather far down on the list; while I composed a little music during high school, it is not something that I have felt motivated to do… until recently.</p>

<h3>Table 4: Key Actions (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Play – 298<br>Sing – 143<br>Perform – 49<br>Chant – 33<br>Conduct – 14<br>Practice –10<br>Hum - 10<br>Compose – 6 </p>

<p>A wide variety of musical instruments have appeared in my dreams, as shown in Table 5. Not surprisingly, the crumhorn and the clarinet—the two instruments I actually play—have a high frequency; as a crumhornist, I play with a recorder group, which might account for the frequency of recorders on the list. But I do not play piano, or any stringed or brass instruments. So their frequent appearance in my dreams would seem to derive from listening rather than playing music.</p>

<h3>Table 5: Instruments (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Instrument – 87<br>Piano – 52<br>Crumhorn – 37<br>Recorder – 31<br>Clarinet – 29<br>Drum – 23<br>Violin – 19<br>Flute – 17<br>Trumpet – 13<br>Guitar – 12<br>Reed – 11<br>Saxophone – 10<br>Cello – 9<br>Organ – 7<br>Viola – 6<br>Bassoon – 6<br>Oboe – 6<br>Harpsichord – 6<br>Mouthpiece – 6<br>Trombone – 5<br>Pipe – 4<br>Sitar – 3<br>Tympani – 3<br>Bow – 3 </p>

<p>The same pattern is demonstrated by the types of performers who appear in my dreams. As Table 6 shows, although wind players are near the top, singers exceed them in frequency; and other types of performers are not far behind. Much of the music I listen to is orchestral but increasingly, chamber music as well. I haven’t listened to much choral music, so it’s surprising that choristers appear so often. This may prefigure the developments I will discuss later in the article.</p>

<h3>Table 6: Performers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Singers – 40<br>Conductors – 26<br>Wind Players – 26<br>Orchestra – 24<br>String Players – 19<br>Table 6<br>Keyboardists – 10<br>Music Teachers – 9<br>Rock Groups – 9<br>Brass Players – 8<br>Bands – 7<br>Jazz Musicians – 6<br>Percussionists – 6 </p>

<p>A wide diversity of composers is represented in my dreams: 54 identifiable composers in all. Table 7 indicates all those appearing at least twice. Mahler and Wagner, who definitely rank among my favorites, are at the top of the list. However, the rest of the distribution is not entirely in accord with my waking life tastes. Some of my favorite composers — for example, Rachmaninoff and Vaughan-Williams — are very far down on the list; others, like Bruckner and Puccini, have only appeared once. With the exception of Michael Praetorius, none of the Renaissance and early Baroque composers whose music I now frequently play appear on this list. It might be suggested that the frequency of composers in my dreams is correlated with the degree to which their music impacts me emotionally … but the four Late Romantic composers I mentioned above, appeared only once or twice, and yet they wrote highly emotionally charged music.</p>

<p>As I reported in DNJ V29#3, during the summer of 2010 I read Jung’s Red Book and it had a profound effect upon my consciousness. Themes from the book frequently appeared in my dreams and waking synchronous experience, and in dreams, often prior to my reading them. The “biggest” dream in this series concerned my observation of a group of choristers performing an a capella cantata based upon texts from the Red Book. Upon awakening, I realized that the texts derived from the “Incantations” section of the book, in which Jung presents a series of prayers within his dreaming that was directed to the Babylonian hero Gilgamesh, whom he had previously (in the dream) mortally wounded then saved, by collapsing him to miniscule size and placing him within an egg, which he brought to a village for incubation.</p>

<p>Subsequent dreaming has made it clear to me that I have been asked to compose this cantata out of themes my dreaming presents to me. Even though I had no formal education in musical composition, I agreed to undertake this project. The first stage was to translate the words of the Incantations from German into Akkadian, the actual language of the Gilgamesh epic. My training in ancient Near Eastern languages has made it possible for me to accomplish this. Next, I am applying to the Incantations section text the specific musical themes derived from my dreams.</p>

<p>My dreams indicated that the cantata would be sung a capella by four voices, and that it would be in 6 sections. In order to manifest this, I have audited two Music Theory courses this year, which enabled me to set the melodies my dreams gave me within a tonal harmonic structure. Far from easy!</p>

<p>The first section I was moved to set to music is associated with a powerful Red Book image (Jung 2009:55): the sun barque of the Egyptian god Ra sailing over the surface of the waters, beneath which lurks a monstrous fi sh, identified by Jung as the “Spirit of the Depths.” The text consists of four lines and the melody for it was given to me in a dream. Translated into English, these are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One word, which has never yet been spoken; </p>
  
  <p>One light, which has not yet shone; </p>
  
  <p>One confusion, without equal; </p>
  
  <p>And one road, without end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-3.jpg" alt="Music spiral" /></p>

<p>Underlying the text, the Akkadian words for “Spirit of the Depths” are intoned as an undulating pedal, representing the waves. In addition, singers from time to time hold long notes on “a,” which is the Sumerian word for water. </p>

<p>The piece is in four sections, each of which corresponds to one of the four lines of the text. The first section picks up the theme of “one word” from the dream, as each line is sung solo above the bass pedal, first by the tenor, then by the alto, then by the soprano, then again by the tenor. </p>

<p>In the second section, the melody is taken up by the sopranos, harmonized by the altos, while the tenors sing the pedal and the basses harmonize beneath them. This corresponds to the “one light” phrase. </p>

<p>In the third, “confusion” section, the sopranos sing arpeggios while the altos hold the pedal and the tenors sing the melody, harmonized by the basses. </p>

<p>The fourth, “road” section, the sopranos sing descending road-like quarter notes while the altos harmonize, the tenors hold the pedal and the basses have the melody. There is a brief coda in which the pedal finally reaches the water’s surface with the soprano line and then works its way down through the voices. </p>

<p>This piece was premiered at the 2011 IASD conference to a receptive audience. A second section of the cantata was performed in August of 2011 at the same music camp that provided the inspiration for the original dream that “commissioned” the cantata. </p>

<p>Since I undertook the writing of the cantata, dreams about it have come in profusion. I have had 47 dreams in which the cantata was featured, 35 providing musical themes. In 11 of these, I have actually visualized the notes on the staff; more often, I just hear the themes. Most of these dreams are just brief snippets… or the theme occurs only at the end of a longer dream. Some dreams have provided me with insights into the structure of the cantata or helped me to revise what I have written. I know that there are themes that I have not been able to recall in the morning, but one dream early in the process informed me that these are being stored in my unconscious for when I will need them later on. </p>

<p>The creative process sometimes takes unexpected twists and turns; for example, the section performed last summer combines two dream themes in a canonical structure. I had no idea that the second theme would fi t the fi rst as well as it does. An early dream indicated that I would need to incorporate a chorale from Bach’s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> into one section of the cantata. Recent dreams have shown me that this will actually be in a rondo form, with several repeats of the chorale interspersed with other dream themes. A section I am working on now contrasts a vigorous hora rhythm from one dream against a more melodic pastoral theme from another. As Jung observed of the paintings which accompany his dreams in the <em>Red Book</em>, sometimes they didn’t come out the way he expected! </p>

<p>In many instances, I have no idea with what portion of the cantata the themes will go. But in other cases, I get the words with the music. My knowledge of music enables me to see that some of the themes bear a relationship to existing music. But other themes are unfamiliar and hopefully my dreams will give me more! ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>People are becoming increasingly health conscious. Dreams, however, are often overlooked as a potential aid to good health. The following account of a persistent health problem shows how dreams can be called upon to provide continuing health care information.</p>

<p>The situation has a history that begins over twenty years ago when I had my first hangnail infection. A hangnail may sound like a minor problem, but the infection was resistant to medical treatment and led to hospitalization. A surgeon removed the infected tissue including the bone tuft. This procedure was effective, but left me with a smaller fingertip. Years later, a similar infection in another finger was treated on an outpatient basis. The result of this treatment was a healed finger that included a hard, sensitive scar tissuelike projection near the nail. I learned that serious risks accompany traditional medical care of such infections. </p>

<p>On December 1, 1984, I recognized the beginning of another hangnail, this time in the original, slightly shrunken, left index finger. It was during a period of considerable stress. I had left full time employment to complete my doctoral program in psychology. My resistance to infection was down. I was also dealing with the residual effects of flu along with persistent middle ear fluid buildup problems. In the intervening years, however, I had adopted a more wholistic life view and this time decided to take more direct treatment responsibility. I began with a small castor oil-soaked bandage. Castor oil is reported to facilitate the healing process.</p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-1.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The next morning I had the first in a series of dreams related to the finger. The dream confirmed the fact that I had a "hangnail" and would riot be seen as a "good patient" by conventional medical doctors. Several days later, the swelling had Increased and the finger was very sensitive to touch. I wrote in my dream journal, "Help, I'm scared." I feared surgery, a medically accepted treatment of choice. I could imagine what the surgeon would cut now that the bone tuft was gone. I did not want to chance losing more of the finger. Neither did I want the expense, risk, or time away from my academic work that traditional medical care would require. I now actively sought help from my dreams. </p>

<p>I interpreted an unclear dream as an indication I should see a doctor. So, on the next day, December 10th, I saw a doctor. He recommended that I discontinue my castor oil treatment, but continue with epsom salt soaks accompanied by an antibiotic ointment. I followed his advice and added visual imagery exercises to encourage the infection coming to a head, so the doctor could cut the upper skin and release the resulting pus. </p>

<p>A frightening dream came the day after I saw the doctor. In the dream, I took a piece of wood my grandfather handed me and noticed that it had termites in one section. I banged the wood on the ground and watched the termites come out, go Into a pile and then die from exposure. I then smashed the Queen and one other termite. To me, the termites in the wood represented infection in the bone. I knew that bone infections are notoriously resistant to treatment. Fear prevented me from seeing positive aspects of the dream. </p>

<p>I became obsessed with the infection. I got my name added to a prayer group listing. I began calling friends asking for their prayers. One friend, who is especially psychic, called back moments after my call. He had been meditating when I called, returned to the meditative state and asked for advice on my behalf. The recommendation which came to him was accompanied by a brilliant white light. I should use a castor oil pack. I was familiar with castor oil packs and had been using one before the doctor recommended I stop. </p>

<p>I got castor oil soaked wool felt and made a total finger pack which I used with heat for an hour and a half two times a day. My psychic friend called a couple of times during the next two days and mentioned he had also gotten the recommendation that 1 use epsom salt soaks followed by a cleansing with lemon oil; that I would see improvement in from three to six days. I followed this advice, but wasn't sure what form the "improvement" would take. The swelling began to increase and was now accompanied by redness and subsurface yellow pus which began to spread around the base of the nail. Seven worrisome days after my friend's initial recommendation I actively sought dream guidance that I could understand. I awoke with a vague impression of perforation of the skin -the idea that if I found a preparation that would help to draw out the infection at this point, that would be helpful. </p>

<p>The following day, December 18th, I saw the doctor for the second time. He carefully cut the surface layer of skin, drained off the pus and applied antbiotic ointment. The finger improved dramatically. I was more relieved than I had been in days. I was able to reflect on my consuming fears of pain, surgery, and possible failure of my wholistic measures. I got insight regarding how I developed the very fearful side of myself. I realized the powerful impact of fear and toned for situations where I had caused fear in others. I could now relax. </p>

<p>The respite was short lived. Ten days after the doctor's treatment, I dreamed: I saw an index finger with the little flap of skin turned back to expose pus. </p>

<p>I checked my finger carefully and noticed pus around the base of the nail. The infection had come back to life. I resumed ointment and castor oil treatment. I anxiously sought dream information. The resulting dreams indicated a connection between the infection and my overly strong preoccupation with it. It was difficult to reduce my preoccupation since I was constantly reminded of the problem by the ever present protective bandage and the fact that I typed several hours each day. Nevertheless, my finger did improve noticeably. Two months after the onset, it looked healed but was still extremely sensitive and barely sable. I had the doctor check it. He assured me that the finger was fine and that I had healed quickly. I knew the finger was not fine. </p>

<p>The sensitivity continued. Once again, I resumed the castor oil treatments and requested dream guidance. My answering dream included a scene where I got castor oil all over my trousers and could not find anything to wipe it off with - hardly a positive recommendation for continued castor oil use. A few days later a dream made reference to a crayfish biting one of the fingers of my right hand. The possibility of the dream being related to the problems with my left index finger were unclear. Another dream reference occurred a few days later when I dreamed of wrestling with someone "in play, but must be careful of my finger." This last dream was dramatic and revitalized fears for my finger. </p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-2.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The question was, if castor oil were not indicated, then what could I do to provide effective treatment? In desperation I began an intense search for treatment clues that included every medical reference I owned, including: <em>Conn's Therapy</em>, the <em>Merck Manual</em>, and wholistic health sources. As a result of my haH day search, I decided to use lodex, a topical preparation I had never used before. I called a store and reserved a jar, planning to pick it up the next day. That night, my dreams came alive. The following dream on February 19, 1985 was a breakthrough: </p>

<p><em>I'm looking into a school yard fenced with chain link fence. In a leanto-like shelter are two college friends sitting in a special mud. It is a life experiment! I recalled having difficulty "getting" the name of the mud. Finally I got it - ICHTHYOL.</em></p>

<p>By the time I was fully awake, I recognized lchthyol as a medication I had react about the day before. I did not associate it with my finger, but thought that the dream was somehow related to my ear problems for which I was also soliciting help from my dreams. I later reread the description, noticed a functional similarity to lodex, and then made the connection. As indicated in the dream, it was difficult "to get." lchthyol is the trade name of a discontinued product - a drawing salve. I did locate the medication under its generic name, ichthammol, and began using it immediately. Surprise! It smelled and looked like mud. I was fascinated and read more about it. The descriptions warned about becoming reliant on such preparations. I slowed down my use of the product. A dream responded by pointing out the spiritual nature of dream guidance and its relevence to my current problem. I resumed full use of the ichthammol. </p>

<p>Three months after the first indication of a problem, I was shocked by the following dream's power and lightning fast action. </p>

<p><em>I'm the lead character on stage in a play. The fellow who designed the play pushed a sword through my lapel and on through my finger. Just as quickly, he withdrew it. I looked down and was surprised to see that it didn't hurt. He had done it expertly. later, I looked at the wound. Each opening had healed, although of course it was still healing inside. I thought about putting salt water on it, but didn't think it needed it.</em></p>

<p>My immediate reaction was: IT WAS A CLEAN CUT. THE FINGER WAS HEALED. </p>

<p>In my joy of realizing the infection was gone, I neglected the statements about continued healing and salt water. Continued finger stiffness renewed my concerns. On March 14, 1985, came the last dream of the series; simply an impression that all the finger needed was exercise. Careful exercise soon brought my finger back to full use.</p>

<p>Overlooked dream clues and encouragement became apparent in a later review of the log. The critical use of a drawing salve in the Jast phases of treatment was indicated by a couple of early dreams. The reference to my grandfather was undoubtedly related to his frequent use of a "drawing salve" as treatment for job-related metal splinters. Another dream referred to a "preparation that would help draw out the infection" long before the mud experiment dream. Other uninterpretted symbols undoubtedly hold a wealth of untapped information. Dreams clearly played a helpful, dynamic andmultifaceted role in the entire healing process.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong>THE OLD MAN</strong> was still working. He had enough money and didn’t need to work, but working was a part of him. He dimly realized that his sparkle of existence fueled by over half a century of work was dying. He needed to know if his illusory passion for a different kind of work was real or only an empty excuse to stop working altogether. </p>

<p>His thoughts floated on the mist of awareness into a dream where…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A slender, almost shapeless woman covered in silence appears before him. Her features dissolve, leaving only the sheen and smooth perfection of her short, silvery-white hair. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream woman was important. She was to be his comfort, his source of reassurance that he needed to give energy to a new dream. She would be able to release him from his worries, the worries of many elders: that their potential for making a mark in the world will be denied them in this new world of speeding change that defies comprehension. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time is visibly absent. Neither the old man nor the woman disturbs the stillness. They just stand opposite one another, seeing each other, but with no exchange of any kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>THE TIRED, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN</strong> had just changed careers. She had emerged from the stifling cocoon of a corporate management position to pursue a new life. With adrenalin-charged power, she worked her way through a grueling graduate education program right along side quick learning students in there twenties. She emerged victorious with a master’s degree, enormous debts, and only a part time job. As she drifts into dreams, she looks forward to seeing her grandfather again. In the comfort and silence of their meetings, their love for each other eclipses the need for any talk.</p>

<p><strong>THE YOUNG MAN IN HIS THIRTIES</strong> feels invincible. His power and vision are as yet unchallenged by the need to overcome the inevitabilities of future discouragement and pain. Dreams provide him with strong counselors and teachers whose advice and answers he knows will ensure success in his all-encompassing endeavors. </p>

<p><strong>THE LITTLE GIRL</strong> is spritely, engaging, and well cared for. She is growing up as she weaves her way through a world of confusing mirages, unspoken rights and wrongs, and the inconsistencies of adult behaviors.</p>

<p>In dreams ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She bravely meets the frightening and comforting lady in blue who returns night after night to stand by her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We usually consider archetypal figures—which are there to help—as being most important in our dreams… but they are not the only ones. Who we draw into our dreams as guides and helpers is influenced by our personal history and our stage of life. </p>

<p>The size of emerging problems, our belief system, our intentions for direction in life, and unconscious drives all combine to govern who will show up in dreamtime to assist us. </p>

<p>Even more so than in waking life, those who come to us in dreams allow us to grow spiritually. Respecting our gift of free will, they rarely tell us what to do. Their unstated perspective is a universal one that transcends the needs of the dreamer’s ego and focuses on the collective Whole. </p>

<p>The more we consider the seemingly simplistic question of who is the most important person in our dreams, the more complex the question becomes. Adding to the complexity is the fact that we ourselves are participants in our dreams - if sometimes only as unseen observers. </p>

<p>With the realization that the power of the universe embodied in love can be focused on us as we dream, we are drawn to an awareness of our own deep value. The dream in all of its quiet, veiled power comes to celebrate us as half-asleep dreamers, who when awake can be enormously vital and important contributors to the welfare of Humanity. </p>

<p>So we might then conclude that the most important person in your dreams very well may be <em>YOU!</em> ∞</p>

<p>Although I regularly recall several dreams a night (actually, in the wee hours of the morning), it has been a long time since I’ve been moved to record them or been touched by the muse to write articles about them. Nonetheless, I treasure my dream state and trust that it mindfully influences my waking life in a positive, albeit mysterious manner. I always try to be patient, note patterns and incubate for understanding.</p>

<p>For the past year, I have been plagued by anxiety dreams with a recurring theme: futilely attempting to pack a suitcase amid chaos. Too many things, so little time and space. A cast of thousands. I awaken exhausted. Now, on the surface, the meaning of these dreams is far from mysterious. In less than a year, I am anticipating a move. The very idea is stressful to me: uprooting from a neighborhood I love; harboring misgivings about whether or not I am making the right decision; all the red tape and masking tape. Change is hard. I get it! I get it! Is this unrelenting barrage on the part of my unconscious really necessary? But, of course, there is way more to the message than meets the closed eye! In waking life, I have become obsessed with the negative changes happening to San Francisco: <em>Manhattanization</em> at an exponential rate; more and more tall buildings going up; overcrowding of parks and busses; excessive, unceasing noise pollution; newcomers with, not flowers in their hair, but cellphones in their ear; rampant greed displacing long time residents of moderate means. My anger and bitterness and utter heartbreak were eating me alive. I knew that I had to either make peace with the changes or leave my beloved city. Then I dreamt...</p>

<h3>KISSING THE BEAR (April 3, 2014)</h3>

<p><em>I am walking around San Francisco. It is so changed that I cannot easily find my way. Van Ness Avenue (Route 101) has turned into a one lane, serpentine roadway with electric trolleys. I just miss one (trolley), and realize that if I don’t start running, I will be very late to my destination.</em></p>

<p><em>I make my way through narrow alleys with older architecture reminiscent of European cities, but then emerge into a totally modern/futuristic area with shiny, wide and colorful square buildings that are for the most part only 4 or 5 stories high; one is constructed of mirrored glass with black and red stripes. There are few skyscrapers and many spacious, clean plazas and no automobiles or mobs of people. As I continue to run furiously, I get the idea of being in two places at once, so I visualize myself in the place I am supposed to be right now: helping my friends to sort things out and pack. The room is gigantic and full of people folding and trying on clothing. It reminds me of a bargain basement sale. I see myself there calmly mixing and mingling and lending a hand.</em> </p>

<p><em>Suddenly a gigantic brown bear—the size of a dinosaur-- plops itself down in the middle of the plaza. Everyone starts screaming and scattering, except one woman. It is L. from my neighborhood. I stop running and watch with awe as she floats up to the bear’s monstrous head and kisses it gently on the lips.</em></p>

<p>When I awake, I know that this is a special dream, the one I have been waiting for. Immediately, I write it down and start composing this piece for <em>Dream Network Journal</em>. I feel energized rather than anxious, which had been the case for months now when it was time to get up and face ‘reality.’ My chronic block against thoughtfully examining my dreams lifted and ideas and associations began flowing. </p>

<p>The most dramatic image in my block-buster dream, without a doubt, is the larger-than-life bear. Official emblem for the California Republic, and incidentally enough, also for the Italian region of Abruzzi, where my grandmother was born. The woman ‘L.’ who fearlessly approaches the beast, lives in my neighborhood in ‘real’ life. Polk Gulch is one of the areas in San Francisco that is in the process of drastic transformation. On three sides of the older, rent-controlled apartment house where she has resided for many years, the buildings are being torn down and replaced by high-rise, high cost condominiums. </p>

<p>After months of expressing justifiable rage and helplessness at the relentless noise and dust and encroaching darkness, she took the bull by the horns—or should we say, the bear by the jaws—and boldly initiated a transformation of her own by embracing the change and the changers. The owner and other tenants of L’s building rallied around her to mediate certain conditions; for instance, the landscaped inner courtyard with Bocce Ball courts and barbeque grills that is part of the new complex will be accessible to them, also. And she convinced the foreman of the construction crew to prune the sprawling avocado tree in their backyard for no charge, saving the landlord a great deal of money or the possibility of having to destroy it. The last time I ran into L. she was beaming and insisted on giving me a tour of the construction sites, focusing on the positive aspects: “See how much wider the side walk is now?” and “No more ‘used condom alley’ out my side window.” </p>

<p>So, it’s no wonder that L. showed up in the dream in the role that she did. And what of the dreamer’s role? I am directed toward helping my friends ‘sort things out and pack.’ Here we go again with that recurring theme, except this time, the atmosphere is calm rather than chaotic— once I encounter the Embracer of Change kissing the Bear. </p>

<p>The day before I had the dream, I met with an old, dear friend, who also feels negatively impacted by the onslaught of changes going on around her. Instead of giving one another support, we ended up arguing and pitting our anger and fear against each other. I was particularly distraught because M. in her youth was a great source of strength and inspiration for me, by the very virtue of her ability to adapt to new situations as she navigated around becoming a slave to the Status Quo. </p>

<p>The dream made it clear that I need to ‘bear’ the transforming cityscape in a more constructive manner in order to help M. and other friends who are feeling even more vulnerable and scared than I am—especially those with less financial resources and options (which the dream alluded to via the suggestion of a bargain basement). Unlike the other characters that are rummaging through clothes and preparing to leave, the dreamer has a choice of being in two places at once: in the plaza with the Bear and in the basement with her friends; in addition, she exists both in the dreaming and waking realm. </p>

<p>Curiously enough, although it is my dream-self that is running through San Francisco’s distant future—one that has evolved beyond the seemingly short-sighted, unenlightened changes that are happening right now, it is not until my waking-self recalls the dream that I realize how the City presented in the dream is actually in tune with my idealistic hopes and visions: No cars. Narrow, meandering roadways offering environmentalysound public transportation. Few sky-blocking buildings. Lots of light, greenery and open space. Older architecture preserved (or rebuilt?) to honor the past. Ah, yes, I could embrace changes like that! So why does my dream-self not take notice of the details of her gloriously redesigned (though barely recognizable) homeland? Could it be to remind me that I must not get too attached to any particular change—good or bad— because, it too, will change? </p>

<p>And why does the theme of change manifest in the form of an animal? Perhaps to convey the concept that change is part of the natural order of things. Which is not to say that we, as humans, should not question change or completely capitulate to it. </p>

<p>We <em>do</em> have the power to positively influence the undesirable transformations by kissing the bear, so to speak, rather than fleeing from it or wildly charging it with spears. The dreamer is inspired by L.’s amazing way of interacting with the Bear and stops running. She has reached her destination: a state of mind in which she can be in harmony with this powerful representative of change as well as with those it is most affecting, including herself. The Bear is no longer <em>in the way</em>, but <em>is</em> the way. </p>

<p>In her position above ground, the dreamer is indicative of the outer circumstances I need to <em>adjust</em> to; her simultaneous presence in the basement, often a symbol for the unconscious, points to the <em>inner</em> workings I need to <em>adjust</em>— namely, my attitude and perspective. So then, I am at once the changer and the object of change; I am invited to take an active part in harnessing the unstoppable forces that are altering my world. I can evolve beyond the mentality of <em>victim</em> and <em>perpetrator</em>. </p>

<p>The sorting and packing scenario speaks to a more obvious and minor concern (Ursula Major and Minor!): changing my address. In the larger scheme of things, this is not a big deal—especially since I will still be residing in San Francisco. Nonetheless, the prospect has been the cause of enough anxiety to get the attention of my unconscious; thus, the series of dreams about preparing to relocate—whose multiple meanings/messages I am just beginning to cultivate. For example, another association that I am exploring is Bear as spirit guide … considering that the creature appeared in the dream by dropping out of the sky. And do I ever need the steadfast presence of a Higher Power to encourage me to remain strong and mindfully detached in the trials ahead! The changes to San Francisco are happening over night, but my ability to better deal with them will be an ongoing challenge. Bear is not only a bastion of strength, but knows when to lie low, disengage from the battles of life for awhile; hibernate and then emerge a bit more vulnerable, grateful and eager to seek out the miracles of a renewed landscape.</p>

<p>As winter turns to spring, one change depends upon and precipitates another. The transformed San Francisco that so pleased the awakened dreamer could not have come into being without the nightmarish transition that is currently taking place. Learning to embrace the smaller transitions can help us to prepare for greater ones; the time may indeed come when I need to let go of San Francisco and move on—if not during the course of my life, then most certainly at the end of it. For, there is no escaping the greatest transition and transformation of all. I’m sure that even the passage from this life to the next—the most inevitable and all encompassing of changes—can be negotiated with a fearless, open-heart if we pay attention to and honor our dreams. Easier said than done, but I feel blessed to be taking the first small steps with Bear at my side. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong><em>“When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em></strong></p>

<p>I first heard those words nearly twenty years ago, in a dream. They have haunted me ever since. In that equation’s utter simplicity, it seems to me, a deep ecological truth about relationships emerges. </p>

<p>In the dream, <em>I stand on a steep sloping river bank of exposed dirt and mud. A friend and I watch helplessly as a lone figure proceeds to cut down the last standing tree on the desolate river bank. As I observe the final bit of green life lean sharply and tumble to the barren ground, an unspeakable sadness rises within me. At that moment, my friend says solemnly, “When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em></p>

<p>On one level, it was ironic to hear these words from my friend, since in waking life, he graduated from the University of Chicago with an MBA and firmly believed in the “Chicago School” of economic thought, which held that the free market would provide for everyone’s needs by properly valuing all items, according to the laws of supply and demand. But having canoed with my friend as a Boy Scout, backpacked with him across wilderness mountain passes in Colorado and New Mexico, and sipped cold water from alpine streams, I knew there was another side of him that valued the beauty and great harmony of nature. </p>

<p>As an adult, I tried to discover what economic value he and the Chicago School’s free market system placed on nature. What was the value of a healthy environment? What was the value of a well functioning ecosystem? How did this economic approach calculate global sustainability? Like many discussions with economists at that time, I found that a properly functioning ecosystem seemed a “given.” We did not have to be concerned about it; the natural world had been built into the equation as an economic assumption. </p>

<p>Yet in this dream, my friend provides an answer with a new and startling economic equation devoid of assumptions and givens. <em>When you harm Nature, you harm yourself</em>. Suddenly the fundamental economic principle of the environment seemed clear: When you deplete nature, you deplete yourself. When you hamper nature, you hamper yourself. When you threaten the proper functioning of nature, you directly threaten yourself. Subtracting from nature, subtracts from you. Enhancing nature, enhances you. Economically and quite practically, my dreamt equation made explicit what economic equations do not: our individual and collective well being is intrinsically connected to Nature’s micro and macro well-being. </p>

<p>Somewhere in history, modern man began ignoring that direct connection with physical nature. Similarly, the rarefied world of economic thought and philosophy dismissed it too. Yet the deeper, archaic, unconscious part of my self, accessible in dreams, still carried the knowledge of this ancient economic equation. A subconscious portion of me knew what had been tragically learned on Easter Island and elsewhere: <em>“When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em> </p>

<p>In dreaming, we possess a connection to this older and wiser portion of our being, which can remind us of ancient truths and guide us to creative realizations and actions—if we do not ignore it. In the final chapter of my recently released book, <strong>Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</strong>, I relate an interesting dream in which <em>a tall, regally dressed man stopped me and asked me a simple question, “What book do you hold in your hand?” Unsure, I brought the book in front of me and read the title, “Dreams: God’s Forgotten Language by John A. Sanford.” Then suddenly, it dawned on me that I had this book on my book shelf but had never read it. I became lucidly aware... ecstatic.</em> </p>

<p>Upon waking, I pondered the idea that the unconscious portion of my larger self had knowingly and purposefully called this book to my attention as important. But why? In the book’s final chapter, “The God Within,” I find one of the possible answers in Sanford’s conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are not only conscious; we are also unconscious. Unconscious psychic reality is as real and substantial as is our conscious life. It expresses its reality in a hundred ways, one of which is the dream. The center of our conscious life is the ego, the center of our total psyche is the self, which seeks to express through our consciousness the totality of our nature.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By attending to our dreams, we have one means to attend to “the totality of our nature.” Without the connection to dreams, we can easily forget and ignore our broader nature and become trapped in an ego-centric and finite world. </p>

<p>With Sanford’s perspective, the wider circle of interrelationships becomes apparent. Not only, “When we harm Nature, [do] we harm ourself,” but when we ignore and deny the unconscious, we lessen ourselves. We lose touch with our inner nature. It is our inner nature that reminds us of our ancient connections to Nature, others and the larger self—the broad circle of being. The gift of dreaming is the gift of that connection. Through honoring that connection, we can find a way. </p>

<p><strong><em>When you love Nature, you love yourself.</em></strong></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>“Butterfly Party” Photography by Laura Atkinson</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>As I unlocked the polished white door of my hotel room, I recited the inscribed jet-black lettering that read: "June 12th, Procession of the Unmarried Woman. In which single women walk through the centre of their village looking for a husband. (Palestrina, Italy.)" I felt obligated to check the calendar. Yes, indeed it was June 12th. On an afternoon that supplied an abundance of heavy, dark clouds pregnant with moisture, I had set out on a solo journey to navigate a foreign railway system determined to find my own way to the city. I asked the universe “..please show me some signs to follow…” In retrospect, that fine lettering seemingly indicated the type of day it had been. </p>

<p>Months before, I began selling my belongings; furniture, knick knacks, dishes, paintings and more. I left behind the city apartment which I had called home for 14 years and started my journey to be with my partner of 5 years in his beautiful European country. Too soon after arriving, I found myself on a plane returning to the States. These events would prove to be the pivotal moments for my individualized catalyst of change. </p>

<p>Being an artist, photographer and devoted dream journalist, I had always considered myself to be moderately skillful at recognizing dreamscape symbolism. Admittedly I am not an expert interpreter, but I consider myself capable of identifying their appearances and working with them. As I wandered my way back to the States, uncertain of any predetermined destination, it felt natural to ask my dreams for guidance. My dreams had been my constant friends in the past, but now I was depending on them.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zflies-1.jpg" alt="Butterfly emerging" /></p>

<h3>Thin Veil of a Butterfly</h3>

<p>I dream of being wrapped in thin silk from head to toe. It is wrapped around my legs and arms, quite difficult to move. I wiggle my arms above my head and push my hands outward against the silk. Through its transparency I am able glimpse a view to a new world…</p>

<p><em>7/12/10</em></p>

<h3>A Visit to the Butterfly Garden</h3>

<p>It was my second visit to the garden nursery in Rhode Island. The warm, milky sunshine and abundance of flora provided a sweetly scented backdrop to what would be the beginning of an ongoing and wondrous experience in synchronicity. With my camera strapped around my neck, I walked upon a pebbled walk-way through a beautiful butterfly garden. Like fidgety toddlers, the butterflies were not behaving and refused to sit for the portraits I longed to take. Rarely would they land on a flower and if they did it was never long enough to catch their image. I shook my head with impatience and was ready to put my camera away. </p>

<p>From the corner of my eye I caught sight of a grey-blue painted, metal chair sitting alone at the corner of the garden. Delicately dangling from the curved edge of the chair was the chrysalis of a Monarch butterfly. It captivated me, those fine details of tightly folded orange and black wings that could be seen through the translucent casing. As I gazed upon it, my dream from earlier that month immediately entered my consciousness. I became the solitary cheerleader for the emergence of this little creature. I stayed with the Monarch for over 45 minutes as it struggled from its outer shell. In my mind I heard unspoken words <em>“You cannot rush a butterfly,”</em> nor can you help it break free of its cocoon, otherwise the risk exists of damaging delicate wings. I simply watched and waited patiently while I slowly snapped photographs of the small miracle unfolding before my eyes.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Consignment Store</h3>

<p>After arriving in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I was introduced to a lovely little consignment store. Nestled among four butterfly dessert plates was Jung’s book <strong>Synchronicity</strong>. Having never read it before, I purchased it, thinking: “Well isn’t that a nice coincidence!” Little did I know that this synchronicity of change and butterflies was still in play. </p>

<p><em>8/24/2010</em></p>

<h3>The Mountain Top</h3>

<p>I drove with my car windows down to an overlook pass on the top of Buffalo Mountain, my camera and Jung’s <em>Synchronicity</em> on the passenger’s seat. I parked my car and grabbed my newly purchased book. It was at that moment a lemonade-yellow butterfly fluttered in through the passenger side window, landed on my arm for a few moments, and then flew out the driver’s side window. My internal dialog asked: <em>Is this a dream? Am I awake?</em> And my inner voice answered my question with another question: <strong><em>Does it make a difference?</em></strong> I decided to simply be moved with the moment, enjoy the metaphor, the beauty, the symbolism, and just become present with the experience. I followed the flight pattern of this single yellow butterfly as it landed on a group of soft-purple milk thistles. Then I watched in awe as at least a dozen more multi-colored butterflies of various species began landing on the flowers surrounding it; each one, carried by the soft wind, landing right before my eyes. Among the many there was a Monarch with its recognizable markings, a deep black butterfly with metallic blue luminescence spotted with pumpkin orange and white droplets, a butterfly speckled with colors of curry and saffron, and my special lemonadeyellow butterfly sitting tall on the highest thistle. Softly and gently they went about their daily business of sipping nectar and picking up pollen, each pausing briefly on the tips of the thistle. I stood alone for an hour on top of the blue-green mountain with only the butterfly-party as my company as I captured their images.</p>

<p><em>8/25/2010</em></p>

<p>So how do I define the butterfly experience? Great question. I had been navigating without a map for several weeks, asking the universe to provide guidance, some signs about the path I am on; provide some sort of divine inspiration I could draw upon. And in response, my dreams answered as did the collection of “coincidences” happening with my eyes wide open. </p>

<p>The continuing butterfly events were dreamlike and awe-inspiring. With my camera I have been intentionally, physically and symbolically “shifting my focus.” My 20/10 eyesight provides minor details at great distance on the horizon, but in doing that so frequently, I often fail to see what’s right in front of my eyes. What I had been doing is purposefully noticing and appreciating the finer details. </p>

<p>This series of experiences not only raised the bar but it shifted it as well. It triggered a new awareness from within, and united it with a new appreciation for symbols and synchronicities. Just as I am capable of interpreting the metaphors and symbols that dreams provide, the time has come to start acknowledging and working with the signs and symbols while awake. Quite possibly, this is what it is all about. Shifting focus to see the microcosm, the macrocosm, the foreground, the background, connecting it all and being open to “seeing” it all, including the coincidences that thread it all together. </p>

<p>I will openly embrace synchronicities that may unfold in both future waking and sleeping dreamscapes, for I know that my personal transformation is not over. You cannot rush a butterfly. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>At a most fascinating time in my life when I was learning how life can respond in real time to the lessons I was /am learning internally, I had the following experience:</em></p>

<p>One summer night, I am walking on the street towards the subway. A car passes with dogs barking out of the window. The barking reminds me of a quote I had read recently about “listening to the barking dogs of the unconscious” (i.e. noticing subtle experiences like nightmares that try to catch our attention with an important message). The driver stops and asks directions and I gladly tell him how to find the street he is looking for. I continue to the subway, contemplating a principle I seem to be learning in my life, symbolically exemplified by the passing car and barking dogs... about how it is wise to give help to people when they ask for it. I don’t think it applies in every situation but there seems to be some truth to this principle, at least spiritually speaking. Like Jesus might have meant when he said, <em>“Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened.”</em></p>

<p>As I descend the subway stairs, I am a little lost in my thoughts when I see an old gentleman slowly hobbling down the steps with a cane. Without thinking twice, I ask him if he needs help. He does not look at me but he does say something very odd: <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> He has a British accent, which is quite unusual in Montreal. I’m confused by his response, yet out of good will I repeat my offer to assist him. He shakes his head and says,<em>“It might be a little convoluted, but hopefully you get the point.”</em> </p>

<p>Well, I don’t get it, but I wish him well and continue down another couple flights to the subway. Nearing the bottom, it strikes me that perhaps the old gentleman is trying to help me learn the precise lesson I was contemplating as I entered the subway, since I twice offered him help when he hadn’t asked for it. I immediately run back up two long flights of stairs to speak to him again. </p>

<p>At the speed he was hobbling down the steps—unless he was completely faking it—there is no way he could have either passed me or even turned back and left the subway. In the 20 or 30 seconds it takes me to sprint back to where he <em>should</em> still have been, there was, amazingly, nobody there! </p>

<p>His peculiar statement suddenly seems to make sense. He said, <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> I laugh at the magic of the moment and return to catch my train, no older gentleman anywhere to be seen. ∞ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Our primary role as dream networkers and educators is simply to make room for the dream in everyday life. The dream is the 'teacher' and primary source of knowledge and information. The dreamer is the one who learns to 'respond' to the dream. The dream-worker is the learner par excellence of the dream. Our role is to constantly open ourselves to the new, the fresh and the challenging lessons that the dream brings to us that challenges our pre-ordered conceptions of what is. We are 'blind-guides' who serve the dreamer's path and by serving we are led with the dreamer to the heart of the dream and to the light that illuminates the dreamer's path. As we soften our biases we come to experience a richer and wider realm of experience.</p>

<p>As we walk this path with dreamers who are also exposed to the web and fabric of life in its deepest reservoir of meaning. If we allow ourselves to be open, then we find ourselves participating in an increasingly wide network of inquiry and relationships.</p>

<p>As dream networkers and educators we must see that our work reaches into every avenue of life. Our models of interaction and creation must reach into the heart of society's myths, structures and beliefs if they are to have relevance. Our methods of relating to dreams must also expand and grow as new understanding unfolds in the society around us.</p>

<p>There is a quiet revolution taking place in higher education from teacher centered learning (pedagogy) to learner centered learning (andragogy). In business a quiet transformation is taking place in organizations that are inverting the organizational chart—the employer is manager; employees engage in setting policy, benefits and often share equally in the profit; the customer is leader. The CEO is growing more concerned with doing the right things in contrast to doing "things" right. Vision, according to Naisbit in <em>Reinventing the Corporation</em>, is the link between dream and action. It is important that this kind of transformational value consciousness be reflected in evolution of the dream network if it is to have any social relevance in the world.</p>

<p>In an evolving dream network the emphasis will be more on results and relationships than on structure, method, process and form. We will recognize that our intra-psychic relationships are most transformational when we perceive ourselves in winning partnerships with our dream characters. Likewise, we will realize the increased value of dream sharing with those around us as a way to deepen the level of understanding and intimacy in all our relationships.</p>

<p>We will encourage dream partnerships to deepen our relationships with others and with ourselves. Our role as dream workers will be to facilitate increased dream literacy and to nurture the space that allows the dream to be expressed in everyday life.</p>

<p>Dream groups can serve a variety of purposes. Some provide short term opportunities to learn particular approaches to dream work or to learn about particular information about dreams and dreaming. Some dream groups serve primarily as a way for peers to share and work with their dreams. Other groups provide for more in depth work on dreams with the help of an experienced guide. Another level is for serious dreamers to develop their dream partnership skills for working with other dreamers.</p>

<p>Dream institutes and centers can emerge as networking points in a wide scale communications network committed to the vision of 'making room for the dream' in society at large. Here dreamers can find support for discovering and refining their own proficiency in working with their own dreams and the dreams of others. New discoveries can be explored, tested and shared with other dream sharing groups and individuals.</p>

<p>In <em>Reinventing the Corporation</em>, Naisbit says that the basic skills required for the new era consists of thinking, learning and creating. We must go beyond these three linear skills in order to function in a non-linear world defined by diversity, fluidity, complexity and high risk. To do this we must learn new and powerful ways to access, explore and express the inner wisdom of our dreaming mind. We can acquire new skills for transforming: our beliefs, outworn values and institutions—so that they can be responsive to the complex, costly conditions facing us. This is our greatest challenge, the building or a network of dreamers who are empowered to act congruently and responsively in a rapidly transforming world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It was time to dig those old dream journals out of the basement. Yes, they were all there stored in plastic storage containers, thirty-three years worth. The early journals were 9½ by 6 inch spiral notebooks. That spiral format had many advantages. Those notebooks could be opened and laid flat and were easy to write in even when lying in bed. And, the day’s events could be recorded on the left side with the resulting dreams of the next morning beginning on the right. They also came in all different colored covers adding a bit of fascination to them. Years later, larger format spirals replaced the small ones only to be replaced still later by three ring binders. </p>

<p>With all of those journals, the question was where to start. An approach that included spot reviews of dreams from ten, twenty, and thirty years ago was appealing. Opening one of the containers, however, revealed the very first notebooks. My plan went out the window. Those early notebooks were just too fascinating to be ignored. My dream work had begun just before my daughter was born. There were the documented worries about Elizabeth who had developed toxemia toward the end of her pregnancy. There was the record of an early dream incubation to let me know what I could do to help her. The dream came through in a simple piece of music, “It’s Sleepy Time down South.” The message was clear. I just need to help her get as much sleep as possible. </p>

<p>The faithfully kept records of days’ events were there too: the exhaustion from getting the nursery ready, even a comment my mother had made that she had climbed up on a chair to hang curtains the day before I was born. There were notes about all the help we had gotten from friends and neighbors. Then of course notes about the joy I experienced when Shannon was born and how amazing it was, just to hold such a precious and beautiful little person. </p>

<p>In true synchronistic fashion, the early journals revealed other things of interest to my current waking life: the name of an old friend that had been eluding me; and toy train dreams that fit in with a problem I’ve been having trying to fix a toy locomotive.</p>

<p>Having given up on the idea of an organized dream search, I followed an impulse to look up the circumstances surrounding the writing of my first article for the Dream Network Journal in 1987. There it was, a note that my article had been published, with a star drawn next to the note showing how pleased I was. </p>

<p>But while looking for references to the DNJ article, I came across a dream of my daughter’s when she was five years old, in her last year of preschool. The dream had been a favorite for years. I remembered it being about a scary monster wearing yellow boots. Because of the dream, I spoke to Shannon’s teacher about little Ritchie, who I recalled wearing yellow boots to school and w known to bite other children. In a quickly arranged conference, the teacher reassured me that Shannon was safe and that she almost never interacted with Ritchie.</p>

<p>As written, however, Shannon’s dream was much different than I remembered. </p>

<p>*I was going that way and I saw a man with big green boots. You know? Like Ritchie’s boots. He was going in big high puddles. I wanted to kiss my mom. He let me kiss you dad because mom wasn’t home. Then he took me home. I’m glad that dream didn’t come true. I don’t like dreams that come true. *</p>

<p>The dream was multi-layered. The meanings, which related to school, big men, high puddles, home, and Shannon’s relationships with her mom and me, are still not entirely clear. On one level, the man represented Ritchie. I had taken action on that assumption. A brief entry the next day indicated that I was with Shannon when she drew pictures of the big man from her dream who wore green boots. Taking control of the big man in her drawings had been effective. He did not return to her dreams. I don’t recall if I had dealt with the dream issue of Shannon’s mom being unavailable or if I encouraged Shannon to share the dream with her mom; but if it had happened today, I would. Her mom and I would have discussed Shannon’s need for reassurance, concerning her mom’s availability. The outcome might have at least resulted in Shannon getting some additional cuddling and an extra kiss or two. </p>

<p>As a young mother herself, I wondered what Shannon would recall of the incident all these years later. Because she lives nearly a day’s drive from me, I scanned and attached the dream journal page to an email and gave Shannon a follow-up call. Shannon said that the dream seemed unusual to her in a couple of ways. In the dream, her mom was not home, but she recalled her mother as always being at home. The dream did not trigger thoughts about her mom being unavailable. Reading the dream, however, did trigger memories of her being a very frightened child. To me, Shannon hadn’t seemed to be a particularly frightened child. During our conversation, I learned about some of her childhood concerns of which I had been unaware. </p>

<p>Eventually our conversation moved back to the present and the topic of availability. Shannon wanted to make sure that I would continue to be accessible to her and the grandchildren. We realized that we hadn’t been visiting as much as we would like. As a result, we scheduled visits that we’re both very much looking forward to.</p>

<p>After putting down the phone, I felt much better about having carted those dream journals around for so long. They not only helped correct and enlarge on old memories, they also confirmed the enduring importance of old dreams. Because dreams are so relevant to the present and come with perfect timing, it may be tempting to discard dreams after they have been read and interpreted, the way we used to discard day old newspapers. Luckily for me, I had kept those old dreams as well as some of my daughter’s. Randomly finding and revisiting one of my favorite dreams of hers was more valuable than finding a gemstone. That old dream had helped strengthen our relationship when she was only five and helped re-strengthen it again over a quarter of a century later. And the icing on the cake was that it provided the catalyst for strengthening relationships with my granddaughter Annabelle, who just happens to be approaching age five, and her three-year-old brother Alex. </p>

<p>After looking at all those old dreams, they with a doubt have relevance for the present and don’t seem to be quite so old after all. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Poseidia Institute was incorporated in 1973 as a Virginia nonprofit organization designed to research and disseminate information on the subject of parapsychology. </p>

<p>Why would the director of a parapsychology research organization be interested in studying dreams? This question makes sense to the person who thinks of parapsychology research as an effort to prove the existence of ESP or extra-sensory phenomena; and, admittedly, most of the respected parapsychology research in America has been conducted along these lines. </p>

<p>However, from its inception, Poseidia Institute began with a different premise - that is we believed that enough research had been conducted to prove to our satisfaction the existence of so-called psychic phenomena, and that the direction of research should be into the possible applications of these phenomena. In many branches of science "applied" study has resulted in considerable growth in understanding.</p>

<p>So we began with a few psychics (or people with demonstrated ESP ability) to determine what seemed to be possible and what methods seemed to achieve the best results. Before long however, by 1976 at the latest, we realized that psychics at Poseidia Institute in particular (as well as psychics in general) were presenting us with a unique theory of how the universe is constructed, and that in order to carry on further meaningful research it would be necessary to accept this theory at least as a working hypothesis. What was the theory? It was this: <em>That consciousness, as distinct from the physical body (brain, mind, etc.), creates what is perceived as reality; that all things have consciousness; and that "reality" might be seen as one vast creative effort occurring in the present moment rather than (as is generally perceived) in linear time/space.</em> </p>

<p>One of the implications of this theory was that, rather than viewing "physical reality" or "waking consciousness" as "real" or "valid" and other, altered states of consciousness as "less real" or "less valid," it might be possible to view states of consciousness (with the discrete components we sometimes label as waking state, hypnogogic state, daydream, dream state, trance, etc.) as a spectrum of creative effort, all being equally valid, real and useful. Obviously, there are myriad other implications which cannot be discussed in an article of this length, but you'll recall that the original question was why would a parapsychologist be interested in dreams. </p>

<p>The answer is that if all states of consciousness are equally real or valid, then dreams (since the majority of people admit to having them) might become the meeting ground for the human race between the possible and the impossible. That is, most people seem to feel it impossible (at least for themselves on any regular basis) to "be psychic", achieve a trance state, or produce ESP; yet these same people will admit to dreaming and remembering their dreams on a regular basis. </p>

<p>My first serious consideration of this idea came in Virginia Beach after I had been experimenting personally with lucid dreaming for over a year. In a conversation with dream researcher Ann Faraday, she said that she felt it was difficult to achieve the lucid state (although she was really talking about lucidity with a one-to-one correlation with physical reality--ie., not only being aware of dreaming while the dream is in progress, but being at a specifically prearranged "physical location" at a specific "time") and that most people could not do it. I started wondering. </p>

<p>During the course of a 1976 "Dream Helper Project", a research project sponsored jointly by Poseidia and the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) (described in my book <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, Donning Co., 1980), it occurred to me that if one were to take a group of people, say at various skill levels in dreaming, and ask them to perform certain tasks in the dream state over a period of six months, it tight be possible to learn a great deal about the state of consciousness called dreaming as well as "psychic phenomena". This was the beginning of Poseidia's Dreams<sup>10</sup> (or Dreams to the Tenth Power) research project, which has been going on intermittently over the past three years. </p>

<p>The goal of the project was to determine whether people could dream on command (which many seemed able to do), to investigate the ratio of lucid to non-lucid dreams in this process, and to explore the symbolic content of the reality creation. Obviously there were some other factors involved here which are generally considered to be psychic, like telepathy and precognition; that is, in order to dream together, a group is employing elements of what is generally considered telepathy, and frequently elements of precognition showed up in the dreams as well. </p>

<p>This first six-month project of Dreams<sup>10</sup> was conducted with staff members and other people closely associated with Poseidia, mostly to see if the theory would work or what might happen if people (some of whom had never met and were located up to 500 miles from each other) tried to dream together. Not only did the experiment work and achieve some of the expected results; but, maybe more importantly - it was fun. What we discovered was that other staff members began to dream along, or show up in the project participants' dreams and vice versa. Dreaming together became the subject of more than just the experiment as people began to use their dreams as a way of working together or exploring their feelings toward one another. Elements of this dream research were incorporated in the dream classes regularly taught at the Institute, in part as a means of exploring how easy or how difficult it was for people to achieve this particular "altered, but equally valid and real" state of consciousness. </p>

<p>Finally in 19b2 we decided to take the ultimate step with Dreams<sup>10</sup> and select (from over 200 applicants from all over the country) two teams of ten people who were complete strangers to one another, and who had no particular education in either dreaming or parapsychology. The task was simply to see if they could "dream together" over a three-month period. The results of this experiment, which are still being analyzed, were surprising even to us. There's no doubt these people were able to dream on request some fair part of the time, and while they were at it, perform some interesting "psychic" feats. For example, the night Team II went to Cindy's wedding, while Cindy, who thought she hadn't met the goal because she was tired and already knew about her wedding, dreamed she "went to the beach with a group of people". Cindy didn't know the beach was the goal for Team I that same night. </p>

<p>Certainly there are research implications of this material which is why, as a parapsychologist, I am interested in studying dreams along with other states of consciousness. But to me the more important thing, and the reason that I enjoy the approach taken by the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, is the application of the research, or the immediate usefulness of the research for myself and other people. Wouldn't you like to try dreaming together with a group of friends? I personally am interested in the potential counseling applications of group dreaming where, for example, a therapist might work with a family by asking them to dream together between counseling sessions. In my opinion we have barely begun to explore the possibilities of consciousness, either in dreaming or "beyond dreaming". Perhaps if we were willing to accept, even as a working hypothesis, the theory presented by psychics that one state of consciousness is as real or as valid as another, it would help us all to alleviate the problems caused by drawing rigid lines between possible and impossible, real and "just my imagination".</p>

  <p>“Nothing happens unless first a dream.” - Carl Sandburg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to talk to you about <em>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</em>, my current dreaming project. In order to do so it is necessary to first give you a little background about myself and about the fairly unique dreamwork process in which I have involved myself over the past thirty years or so. </p>

<h2>Some History</h2>

<p>I was fortunate that fairly early in my career in that I was asked to direct a small, non-profit organization in Virginia Beach, Virginia, called Poseidia Institute. At that time, the focus of research was on the intuitive process — what made people able to do such things as accurate psychic readings(?), for example. What made it possible for ‘healers’ to ‘cure’ and ‘telepaths’ to give information for someone halfway around the world? </p>

<p>Because these questions were primary to my own research as well, it quickly became clear to me that dreams — whatever else they may be — are the one altered state of consciousness we all share. Therefore, talking to people about dreaming might reduce the general awe in which psychics and psychic phenomena were held, that is when they were not being denied or ridiculed. </p>

<p>So I began with the premise that we are all psychic, that being psychic is our nature. It wasn’t long before the necessity to examine the nature of time and space became important to me as well, since the psychics I knew often talked about alternate realities, or other areas of time and space. </p>

<p>These were interesting times in the field of dreams, during the 1970s. John Herbert, Richard Wilkerson and others summed some of that history up in articles in the last issue of Dream Network. </p>

<p>On the East Coast, Dr. Henry Reed was publishing his <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> for the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE). This journal served the function of bringing dreamers into dialogue. So popular was this quarterly journal that, when the ARE stopped its production, a New Yorker by the name of Bill Stimson decided that something needed to be done to keep the grassroots dream community going. He was so convinced, that he started a small publication of his own, the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, which was an immediate precursor of the Dream Network you now hold in your hand. </p>

<p>The staff of Posiedia Institute was involved in these events, with other editors of the DNB, Suzanne Keyes, and Linda Magallon. We were all volunteers in a project we called <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em>, a group dreaming experiment. </p>

<p>At the same time Henry was publishing the <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em>, he was also conducting his <em>Dream Helper</em> experiments, a process he had devised for getting people incubate dreams to help another dreamer. </p>

<p>In conversation one day, Henry and I decided it might be interesting to see if dream helpers could work with someone they’d never met, or met only briefly. So it was determined that the next person who filled out an application for a psychic reading from one of Poseidia’s staff of very competent psychics would be, if they were willing, the target for a Dream Helper experiment. </p>

<p>The majority of people coming to Poseidia for readings at that time were there for medical assistance, often referred by their doctor or therapist. So when the next application arrived, we invited the young woman to participate in this joint ARE/Poseidia Institute experiment. </p>

<p>What occurred to me the next morning, when the ‘dream helpers’ met to report their dreams—myself among them—was that not only had several members of the group accurately targeted the young woman’s illness, but the dreamers actually appeared to have shared dreams.</p>

<p>This subject of sharing dreams fascinated me so much that I decided to devise some sort of experiment to see if people could share dreams, possibly even lucid dreams, on a planned basis. This was the beginning of a set of experiments which took place over several years. The results of these experiments more than convinced me that spontaneous mutual dreaming is fairly common, though not so commonly reported; I was also convinced that skills such as mutual, and even mutual lucid, dreaming can be developed.</p>

<p>It was out of this background then that I returned in 1996 to The Association for the Study of Dreams. As one of ASD’s earliest members, I had presented at the second ASD conference in Charlottesville, Virginia, but then left dreamwork behind for doctoral work at American University, and later for work as a senior Science Fiction/ Fantasy editor. </p>

<h2>We’ll Cross That Bridge When We Come To It</h2>

<p>So how does all of that bring us to the World Dreams Peace Bridge?</p>

<p>The period between 1985 and 1995 was very important to the study of dreams. In California, Linda Magallon continued the study of mutual and group dreams, finally resulting in her book, <em>Mutual Dreaming</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1997. Interest in dream lucidity continued to grow, supported by activities like Ruth Sacksteder’s Lucid Dream Exchange. </p>

<p>Although there continued to be an interest in both interpretive dreamwork and theoretical dream research, dreamers were also becoming interested in such things as Dr. Stanley Krippner’s ongoing research into Shamanic dream practices around the world, and the work of Australian author, Robert Moss. These researchers and others were talking about the important role dreaming has played in world cultures, apart from the more scientific models of Western culture.</p>

<p>I have often told the story of sitting at a table overlooking the ocean on the terrace of the beautiful University of California Santa Cruz campus, with a group of some of the top experts on dream lucidity. Someone asked how people had first become lucid. One man responded, holding up his hands, “I looked at my hands.” One by one, around the table, people grinned and held their hands in front of their faces in silent homage to Carlos Castaneda who, even if he made it all up, introduced an entire generation of dreamers to lucidity through <em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em>. </p>

<p>During the decade in which I was away from dreamwork, more dreamers had become conversant with theories of time and space presented first by Albert Einstein, followed by an entire group of nuclear physicists and popularized by writers such as Gary Zukov, Michael Talbot, and Fred Alan Wolf. Now it was not so unusual as it had once been for dreamers to believe that possibly consciousness—particularly dreaming consciousness—could extend beyond the boundaries of linear time and cross the boundaries of space. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly the single most important development of the decade was the Internet, where almost as soon as longdistance communication was possible, dreamworkers like the Rev. Jeremy Taylor, John Herbert, Jayne Gackenbach, and Richard Wilkerson were communicating globally with dreamers around the world and constructing Internet dream resources which far outshone anything available to dreamers prior to that time. </p>

<p>When I returned to ASD in 1996, almost the first thing I did was volunteer to moderate the Online Bulletin Board at http://www.asdreams.org. I was fascinated by the potential of the Internet to link dreamers with one another and to provide instant communication. Whereas before, when the <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em> research was going on, weeks of sending dream accounts and responses through the mail were discouraging to dreamers. Now communication was instantaneous, free... with the click of a key. </p>

<p>As soon as I began to moderate the Online Bulletin Board, I noticed one less-than-surprising thing: a majority of the questions—from kids writing school papers, from adults with sleep disorders, from dreamers all over the globe—focused on subjects which, heretofore, had been classified under ‘paranormal’ dreaming or ‘anomalous’ dreams. There were questions about out-of-body experiences, about dream telepathy, about mutual dreams and experiences of sleep paralysis. It seemed that this type of dreaming, far from being paranormal, was — if we were to believe the people who came to the Bulletin Board — very normal indeed. </p>

<p>The visitors to the Bulletin Board, some of whom became so regular that we began to call them Boarders, carried on the practice of grassroots dreamwork which began in the seventies. Even though dream interpretation is not done on the Bulletin Board, wideranging questions about dreaming and dreamwork are discussed, with equal participation from therapists, sleep and dream researchers, artists as well as from dreamers themselves. </p>

<p>In the two years after I began moderating the Bulletin Board, Ed Kellogg developed the Paranormal Dreaming Forum on the ASD site, and we began also to create ASD Member Pages, which allowed for members to put up a page online, introducing themselves and their work. It was not long until I conceived a plan for bringing International members even closer, through the medium of the Internet. In 1998, I invited ASD members around the world to participate in the construction of the Online Guide to International Dream Work. This project not only provided a stunning array of multi-language pages for the ASD web site, but it also built a feeling of camaraderie among the ASD members working on the project, even though they lived in Greece, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and many places in between.</p>

<h2>The Effects of 9/11</h2>

<p>Given my sensitivity to the issues of interest to the online dream community, it wasn’t much of a stretch for me, when I saw the televised report of the second plane flying into the Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, to go to the computer and invite people to post their dreams and feelings to the Bulletin Board. I saw the number of precognitive dream reports without surprise and before long I was writing an article called “Dealing With Precognitive Dreamer Guilt,” <a href="http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm">http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm</a>, which Richard Wilkerson generously published in his online magazine <a href="http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm">Electric Dreams</a>. I was touched by the outpouring of sympathy and understanding, which came to the U.S. from dreamers around the globe. </p>

<p>Then, as the bombs began dropping in Afghanistan, two of my lifelong interests came together with a very loud click. I have been a pacifist ever since, as a graduate student in the 1960s, I did Conscientious Objector counseling for the American Friends Service Committee. </p>

<p>I remembered the plenary speech Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, director of Pacifica Graduate Institute, made at the 1999 ASD Conference in Santa Cruz: <em>‘Dreaming the World.’</em> That lecture caught my attention because Aizenstat was saying what I had believed for years: that people, and all sentient beings, are dreaming the world into existence, all the time. </p>

<p>This is not a new idea, having been the foundation for Aboriginal Australian culture for thousands of years, as well as fundamental to other indigenous cultures. Numerous psychics, such as Edgar Cayce and Jane Roberts, have said the same thing. </p>

<p>In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace. </p>

<h2>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</h2>

<p>In October of 2001, I sent an e-mail to approximately one hundred people: friends, family, those ASD members who had worked on the Online Guide to International Dream Work, inviting them to join me in a discussion group, which I later labeled the first-ever longterm group journaling experiment. There was something that had struck me in my own briefly precognitive dream on the morning of 9/11. In that dream, <em>I was standing in the control tower of an airport, watching as an air traffic control person dealt with an obvious emergency.</em></p>

<p>What struck me about the dream was that, although I was in the control tower, I was only an observer. My dream reminded me that I had the ability to respond, a response-ability to be in control, as we all do if we believe that we are dreaming the world. </p>

<p>In the last issue of <em>Dream Network</em>, Richard Wilkerson labeled this emerging attitude as Dream Activism. In fact, there are other groups now following the model of the World Dreams Peace Bridge, and there are a growing number of dream activists. Is this a new concept? Not entirely. During the time between the emergence of ‘grass roots’ dreamwork and today, many dreamers have recognized that — from a certain position in the dream, often a lucid dream, and sometimes a group or mutual dream — it is possible to act consciously from the dream state, to communicate with others and to participate in creating the magic of reality. </p>

<p>The World Dreams Peace Bridge, which maintains an active membership of around fifty people, is composed of dreamers from around the world: Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, New Zealand, the U.S. and many other places. In its waking form, as a discussion group, the Peace Bridge operates as a support system for dreamers. New ideas are explored; dreams are told; because of its international membership, news is often reported from one country or another before it is picked up by the press. </p>

<p>At the dreaming level, the World Dreams Peace Bridge has acted as a catalyst for creativity. One example of this is the Peace Train Project, which has grown from a dream Jeremy Seligson dreamed in Korea in August 2002. </p>

<p>In the dream, <em>Jeremy was riding with a group of people on a train across the country. The train, which bore a banner calling it the ‘Peace Train,’ ended up at a platform on which President Gore stood.</em></p>

<p>From the dream, when he first recounted it, Jeremy began to muse. What would happen if people all over the world began to create peace trains? What would happen if children were asked to create peace trains? What would peace trains carry? </p>

<p>Other members of the group began to get enthused and now—less than a year later—Peace Train projects and Peace Train workshops have been held or are planned for Korea, Australia, India, Turkey and the United States. UNESCO has praised the Peace Train Project. Jeremy has created a Peace Train song and is working on a video. There will be a Peace Train workshop at the ASD Conference in Berkeley in June. And the Peace Train Project has brought more dreamers to the Peace Bridge. </p>

<p>By the fall of 2002, the World Dreams Peace Bridge had become so active that we needed to create a web site. With the work of webmistress, Liz Diaz—who had already designed a beautiful World Dreams logo—<a href="https://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org/">http://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org</a> was created. The site, among other things, now houses a marvelous collection of art, which has grown out of the dreams of various peace dreamers. </p>

<p>Most recently, in the time just preceding massive world-wide peace demonstrations against U.S. attempts to convince the United Nations to approve war against Iraq, members of the World Dreams Peace Bridge sponsored a Peaceful Solutions Dream In, inviting not just members of the Peace Bridge but dreamers everywhere to join us in attempting to dream up peaceful solutions to the world’s conflicts.</p>

<p>In my own estimation, these are good questions for all dreamers to consider, not just dream activists. In the work I was doing at Poseidia Institute in the 1970s, I was often told that I was ahead of my time. Recently, when I helped to facilitate ASD’s first PsiberDreaming Online Conference, an online psi event that had participants asking for more, I was told that my first book on dreams, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, published in 1980, had withstood the test of time. But, for myself, I have seen Dream Activism as a natural development, an outgrowth of believing that dreams might predict the future or support such things as lucid/mutual communication. </p>

<p>Much has happened in the past thirty years to convince Western dreamers that we might be creating the world (or many worlds) through our dreams. Dream Activism, or projects like those of The World Dreams Peace Bridge, are no more than our attempt to become increasingly more conscious of what we already know to be possible. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It all began in a dream telepathy contest, where strange – stranger-than-usual – things happened.</p>

<p>It was 2006, my first year attending the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) annual online PsiberDreaming Conference (PDC), which always includes psi dreaming contests. For this one Beverly D'Urso was “sender,” endeavoring to mentally transmit a target image. We contestants were to post our dreams online; when four pictures were posted we'd each choose which best matched our dream; then judges would select winners with the best “hits.”</p>

<p>On the designated night I took off flying and called out, “Beverly, show me the picture!” I found myself “flying over a snowy scene.... A stretch of bare soil... a very large dog appeared.... Another smaller, darker dog was with him... possibly rescue dogs.... Suddenly I was indoors looking at and hearing an announcement of the answer... pictures of different types of dogs.”</p>

<p>Mary Pat posted her dream just after mine: hers had “reindeer with red leather harnesses... intense cold, rounded hills of snow and ice....” and then, “the image of a dog, nothing else, the background dark.... I realized he was a husky....”</p>

<p>At least four others dreamed of snow. Bob dreamed of a snowball fight, then twice of dogs: one on a bed with him, one on the bedroom floor. Val dreamed her parakeet was “the size of a large dog”!</p>

<p>When the four picture were posted, surprisingly, none had a dog. But one was a scene of snow and bare ground – with two elves looking up into pines: a young one in a gray jumpsuit, a scowling older one in a red pointed cap. Had anyone dreamed the elves? </p>

<p>Yes! Sonia's dreams had a boy in a gray jumpsuit; B.A.'s, a boy, then “a red triangular shape.” Dolores dreamed of two dwarves in pointed red caps. Ilkin got the facial expressions: “Grumbling/curious.... Looking for something.... Snow.” Patricia dreamed of elves sheltering in a tree from a storm; “the dog alerts them....” </p>

<p>Some dreamed evergreens and Christmas scenes. It was like putting together a puzzle. Indeed Ed, an experienced psi dreamer, dreamed that he failed to solve a blue and white interlocking puzzle on a white countertop. He correctly took this as a clue that the dreams of snow were better “hits” than his! </p>

<p>We were delighted when Beverly revealed the target: the elves-in-snow. Then she posted her own dreams from her night of “sending,” including this: “Extremely large dog... climbed into this little bed with me. I was saying, 'No, no, no....'”!</p>

<p>So where did all the dogs come from?</p>

<p>Finally Suzanne disclosed that, the same night, she'd also participated in another dream psi experiment. The target? A team of sled dogs in the snow!</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-0.jpg" width="300px" height="auto" alt="Snow target image with two elves"></img></p>

<p>Discovering these and other complex interconnections unfolded an extraordinary camaraderie. Kathy posted that she was “impressed with the way people are dreaming together – we seem to have woven a tight fabric of related dreams in the last 24 hours: a harmonious dream song....” </p>

<p>I agreed. “What an experience – tuning into shared dream-space with not only Beverly but, as it turns out, all who participated.... Everybody wins by participating and experiencing our connectedness. There could be no greater reward.” </p>

<p>The judges deliberated an extra day, citing “the strange and wonderful things that happened,” then gave ties for first, second and third with a flock of honorable mentions.</p>

<p>I posted, “It was difficult to evaluate my own dreams' relation to the target without looking at everyone else's. Think how fun and rewarding it would be if that were the object of the game! – especially if choosing among possible targets as in [this] contest – treat it as a group dream and say, for instance, “Wow, there's a lot of snow in here! …And look at all the elves. I vote #1 is the target.” </p>

<p>Six years later I helped create just such an event for the 2012 PDC. The Group Remote Viewing Game proved a splendid test of the hypothesis that a group can work together to generate dream clues, then solve a mystery. </p>

<p>But I've told that story elsewhere (IASD's Dream Time magazine). Here, let's play with a less-testable idea: Do people dreaming toward a common goal form something like a group mind? </p>

<p>The target: King Tutankhamun's golden funerary mask. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-1.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"></img></p>

<p>The dreams: multiple puzzle pieces, including two or more of each of the following: ancient cities, artifacts, the Middle East, rulers, spiritual figures, temples, ceremonies, statues, portraits, boxes, graves, dimly-lit rooms, mummy-like wrappings, gold – lots of gold. And there were surprising mirrorings in ways dreaming minds interpreted these themes. A few among many oddly intersecting dreams that pointed to the target:</p>

<p>Dale dreamed, “I am traveling to a remote place where I witness some type of ceremony inside a building... possibly a communion.” Jay dreamed “a single image. A flat smooth shiny green leather case... containing a shiny metal plate (paten) with a single large communion host on it.”</p>

<p>Sarcophagus-like, the case holds what many Christians call the body of Christ, considered – as Egyptians considered the Pharaohs – both God and man. But why green? Perhaps because Rita was dreaming of a “magical/mystical... green box”?</p>

<p>Rita also dreamed of a golden “statue of the Mary, the Madonna” while Valley was dreaming of “the embodiment of Mary [with] large dark living eyes.”</p>

<p>No one dreamed “Egypt,” but Carol dreamed initials UR and thought of the ancient Mesopotamian city, while Kate dreamed “a repeating motif of blue and aqua” reminding her of "the detail work on an ancient frieze from Mesopotamia.” </p>

<p>Kate had apparently zoomed in on the mask's lapis lazuli and turquoise inlays. It also has alternating blue and gold stripes; Sharon dreamed gold stripes on a gold-framed portrait of a revered and famous man, while Ed dreamed blue stripes on the head of a powerful, reclining magician.</p>

<p>Now here's another unscientific notion. When people dream together, does the waking world collaborate?</p>

<p>Maria recounted her experience on the night designated for dreaming the target. “I have a model of Tut's sarcophagus [that] toppled over that evening for no apparent reason, obliging me to take notice of it as I set it right again....”</p>

<p>Carol was deliberating which image best matched the group's dreams when when “out of nowhere” an acquaintance told her, “Maybe you were a pharaoh's daughter in a past life.... I thought of you last night when I turned on a movie and watched The Mummy Returns!” </p>

<p>When I revealed the target, Kate was listening to a presentation on her iPod. “The presenter started talking (out of the blue) about Egypt, pharaohs, and how people had said Obama looks like a pharaoh.”</p>

<p>And at that moment Carol heard “Walk Like An Egyptian” on the radio.</p>

<p>A few participants' closing remarks:</p>

<p>Sharon: “So glad we all did what we did together. It does work....”</p>

<p>Maureen: “It's nice to feel that the combined vision, the pieces of the puzzle that each dreamer contributed, each in his or her own way – really made this event work.... I'm very, very impressed with the success of this event and the rich psi content of the dreams....The communal focus felt extraordinary to me.”</p>

<p>Laurel, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.: “'We must give an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in our individual societies.' Seems like this game has been an excellent example of a group coming together in this way.”</p>

<p>Tony: “It's been a lot of fun and left me with a very strong feeling of – what's next!”</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>READING THE RED BOOK, Spring Journal Books, 317 pp</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>When The Red Book of Carl Gustav Jung was published, it caused an immense stir, offering readers a plethora of new mysteries and depth psychology insights. I cannot predict that this interpretation will set so large a wave of interest in motion, but it may. <strong>READING THE RED BOOK</strong> certainly deserves attention. It is a work of wealth in itself. And you may find it of interest that the author confesses not to be a Jungian and yet he uses Jung’s often idiosyncratic spiritual quest—for soul, Self and the God-yet-to-come—to confront and challenge the materialist psychology dominating our materialistic society’s science of mind and soul. </p>

<p>From the onset, Sanford Drob is clear about what he has done and how he has done it. Beginning at the Introduction, it is worth listening into the author as he explains his intention. Drob’s first paragraph is this: “Jung held that dreams are challenges to the assumptions and complacency of the ego, compensation for one-sided conscious attitudes, or messages from the unconscious that prompt us to question the value and direction of our current mode of thinking, feeling and living. By this defi nition, Jung’s The Red Book...is akin to a dream... Like many dreams the <em>dream</em> that is The Red Book is at once magnificent and grotesque.” </p>

<p>A page later, the author sets before us the major points of his investigation: “Although I have endeavored to be balanced and as comprehensive as possible... I have become convinced that while The Red Book narrative centers around Jung’s’ soul-finding journey, its greatest value may be its ideas on such themes as God, humanity, madness, chaos, death, science, reason, knowledge, logic, and evil.”</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Drob introduces us to a confession, his method, and his intention. He continues: “I am not a Jungian. While I believe that my treatment of The Red Book is a sympathetic one, I do not hesitate to raise questions about Jung’s approach to various issues and his suggestion that spiritual wisdom and enlightenment must involve an inner, solitary journey. In many instances, without providing anything resembling an answer, I raise questions that the reader will want to consider for him or herself.” </p>

<p>Drob concludes his informative Introduction with the following lines: “The immense size and weight of the facile edition, along with the haunting beauty and mystery of its illustrations leads one to approach Jung’s Red Book with a certain caution—it is hardly the sort of work that one curls up with in bed… and yet it is a work that, above all else, must be read; read, and then studied and reflected upon… In the present work, I propose to read The Red Book, and, in the course of this reading, wrestle with the questions it asks, *on the hope of experiencing something new, seeing life from a new perspective and perhaps being personally transformed in the process.” *</p>

<p>Sanford Drob is thorough in his investigative exploration of The Red Book’s Psyche Odyssey of CG Jung: an interior journey, an intellectual, emotional, spiritual going down into the depths—even Jung’s descent into personal hell, madness, chaos—to seek the alchemic matrix that brews the dynamics of individuation, the nexus of soul and self, and to search out the Unknown God who addresses emergent identity through the individuation process. One major result of this Odyssey is what Dr. Drob comes to refer to as “dream theology,” rendered out of The Red Book journey as dream... a dream of human psychology, which came to provide fertile ground for Jung’s psychology of dreams and dreaming. </p>

<p>Drob is also thorough in his routing back over Jung’s dreamlike rite of passage. Unfortunately, I cannot be so as a reviewer and must yield to the limitations of my spatial condition. Let me but cite several passages from the cornucopia of <strong>READING THE RED BOOK.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>P.3:</strong> “Jung’s goal in The Red Book was to encourage others to discover their own soul and assume responsibility for their own lives.” </p>

<p><strong>P.5:</strong> “Jung’s discussion of the spirit of the depths raises the question of whether there is...a form of gnosis that is not conditioned by time and place... It is the quest for such a trans-temporal, trans-cultural... understanding that fueled Jung’s early interest in mythology and conditioned his inquiries into the archetypes of the collective unconscious.” </p>

<p><strong>P.6:</strong> “For Jung, the supreme meaning, which gives rise to the image of the God-yet-to-come, is the melding together of meaning and absurdity, sense and nonsense.” </p>

<p><strong>P.22:</strong> “Jung asserts that meaninglessness and chaos is the ‘other half of the world,’ and no one can be complete or have a full understanding of the world without embracing its chaotic and meaningless elements.” </p>

<p><strong>P.23:</strong> “The descent into chaos is perilous, but it also yields great reward.” <strong>(Jung)</strong> ‘If we open up to chaos, magic also arises .’”</p>

<p><strong>P.29:</strong> “In Rudolph Otto’s terms, Jung seeks a numinous experience, an experience of the mysterium, that fearful yet fascinating and aweinspiring rapture that lifts one from the despair of the everyday and allows one to experience self and the world as bathed in the darkness of terror and/or the light of wonder, awe, and spiritual affirmation.” </p>

<p><strong>P.260:</strong> “The Red Book has many characteristics that are typically associated with dreams: it is filled with strange, haunting and at times frightening images; its narrative is surreal and, most importantly, it arrives into our awareness in a manner that is completely discontinuous and disruptive of our business...as usual” </p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> the individuation process, with connectives between soul, Self and an emergent God-image and in its dream-actuals and dreamlike episodes, disrupts established patterns of identity for the coming into being of mature identities, through dialectic developments and revelatory dialogues. The dream of The Red Book parents the work of depth psychology; out of the depths emerge contours of a dream theology. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>During a recent trip to San Francisco I had the opportunity to attend the play "A Woman Dreams in a Seafood Restaurant" at the Habitat Center with two other dreamworkers, Sally Shute and Donna Levreault.</p>

<p>A mood is set as the waitress sets the table. The customer enters, hurried, depressed and withdrawn. The waitress displays an overbearing presence and clearly patronizing attitude as she repeatedly serves food that is unedible and must be returned to the kitchen. </p>

<p>As the woman's frustration grows, each trip to the kitchen triggers a deeper drift into a dream-like torpor emphasized by effective lighting and sound effects.</p>

<p>The disgusting food, the shadow personalities of the woman and the the birth of darkness are portrayed by various dream characters. The first and most colorful is a lobster chef who forces the woman to eat a lobster which has been served in lieu of her rejected food. The second figure is a dark figure of a machine having all the disgusting qualities necessary to turn even the audience's stomach with its snorting and disgusting eating habits. This second figure joins the woman for dinner. </p>

<p>As the play moves along the disgust gathers momentum until a grey mythical god delivers the waitress to the scene out of swaddling clothes. Soon the waitres s gives birth to black bat-like figures which the machine promptly gobbles down with disgusting relish. And so it goes. After the dream ends and the bill is presented in which the woman must pay an exorbitant fee - she leaves in confusion. </p>

<p>Below the colorful persona and art lies a deep portrayal of hopelessness and disgust of life in isolation amidst the shadow of technology. There is no observable indication of any healing elements in the dream or of possible transformation except in the direction of darkness. </p>

<p>This mode of theater has some obvious potential in the use of effects and costumes to portray dream states. The particular play "A Woman Dreams in a Seafood Restaurant" leaves the viewer confused and with a sense of disjointed incompleteness, not unlike waking from a disgusting dream that requires a considerable amount of dreamwork. One is tempted to want to re-enter the dream and re-enact it.</p>

<p>Like the times in which we live there is a sense of hopelessness and the dream is left unfinished. In the midst of this theater in which we all play the dream worker's task is clear. </p>

I awoke to this strange sound coming from outside my window.<br>

After a while, it occurred to me it was coming from the trees.<br>

They were creating music; they were singing!<br>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Published in <strong>Ullman on Dreams</strong>, Vol. 19, No. 2, May 1975,  pp. 8-10, The American Academy of Psychoanalysis</em></p>

<p><em>Paper delivered at a Conference of Scientists with J. Krishnamurti at Brockwood Park, October 14, 1974.</em></p>

<p>I felt drawn to this theme as a consequence of three significant failures in my own life, which originally I thought were due to my own failings but were related to what I now think are the limitations of science, limitations that each of us in our own way are trying to talk about.</p>

<p>We start out in this world as more or less undifferentiated globs of protoplasm and our task appears to be to evolve into a human being having a place in a complex technological society. If we shift to a metaphorical mode we are up to our collective necks in deep water. To save ourselves from going under we reach out for support with only our right hand to grasp at what we think are a succession of solid structures. This is the master hand, the hand that enables us to master nature, to see the world as object and deal with the world objectively. This is the hand of science as science has come to be practiced. There is an awareness of the existence of a left hand and, on occasion, it flails about in the water. It is not seen as equal in strength and power to the right hand; rather it is seen in a somewhat negative light. It is labelled the "sinister" hand and is simply regarded as not being the right hand. Using only the right hand we do achieve a differentiated state, but one that never quite gets us out of the water, so that we continue to struggle atomistically against the forces tending to pull us under. Using both hands together in complementary fashion, however, would not only get us to that state of differentiation, but would also enable us to tackle the really important question of coming together on dry land in order to get on with the business of exploring and enjoying the universe. End of metaphor.</p>

<p>The use of both hands in getting us out of the water can still be called science, I suppose, but it would be quite a bit different from the science we now know. It would move from its preoccupation with nature as object to be mastered to a concern with what it is that has been mastered; and conversely, what it is that has been omitted, i.e., the sensuous aspects of man and nature and the price paid for this one-sidedness in human terms.</p>

<p>There have been various ways of noting this duality apart from the right brain, left brain dichotomy implied in the metaphor - the way of science vs. the way of mysticism, the categorizing vs. the contextual mode of information processing. Others speak of objective knowledge vs. sensuous knowledge, or the active mode vs. the receptive mode. The terminology I find most congenial is borrowed from the formulations of Andras Angyal, a psychiatrist who should be better known than he is. Angyal characterized the two essential trends in the human organism as the striving for autonomy, i.e., the self-organizing, self-enhancing, self-determining tendencies, and the striving for harmony, by which he meant the need to relate to and feel a part of a larger whole. The methods of objective science appear to have evolved in connection with the former, whereas our capacity for love and our aesthetic expression seem more related to the latter. My point is that science has paid too little attention to man's homonomous needs and there are too few psychoanalysts around to pick up the pieces.</p>

<p>The three areas of failure I referred to earlier are areas where the scientific method should presumably work, but where in my experience it falls somewhat short of the mark. In each instance my feeling is that the failure is traceable not to the flaws of the scientific method, but to the lack of an effective complementary approach.</p>

<p>Failure number one is the general field of psychiatry. I am a psychiatrist by profession. A significant transformation occurred in my life when I allowed myself the realization that psychiatry was not a part-time affair, that its practice was more of an art than a science and, as such, it demanded a total commitment and that the level at which one pursued it could not be divorced from the life style of its practitioners. I will not go into the evidence in support of this except to call your attention to several beginning trends in this direction, i.e., Laing's effort to provide a total environment at Kingsley Hall, Jones in his evolution of the therapeutic community at Dingleton Hospital and now, in the States among the young, a movement known as radical therapy.</p>

<p>Failure number two has to do with the longest, unsuccessful courtship in history - the near century old effort on the part of a handful of serious scientists and scholars of all kinds, interested in psychic phenomena, to woo the interest and acceptance of the scientific establishment so that the romance could be legitimized and ultimately consummated. While still in college I discovered that men like William Crookes, William James, Charles Richet, Oliver Lodge and Henri Bergson, to name a few, took a serious interest in what was then called psychical research. At that same time, add the fact that in the course of experimenting over a period of two years with some fellow students I came upon what I felt were rather remarkable and genuine paranormal phenomena, and you have what, for a young person, were the makings of a terrible dilemma. The result, of course, was that I felt impelled to build a special psychic closet in which to house this particular skeleton. Only in recent years, in response to a changing scientific ambience, have I gently opened the door. Someday it may be possible to transform the skeleton to a fullbodied creature, able to walk out of the closet by himself.</p>

<p>The final failure was linked to, perhaps, the most profound transformation of my professional life. It was my realization that Freud's theory of dreams was wrong. Lest this sound both immodest and disrespectful, let me hasten to add that his was a magnificent theory, richly presented, and it did call attention to the therapeutically useful features of dreams. Freud, in my opinion, in his determination to build a scientific psychology, approached dreams through the wrong mode. It was like trying to pick up a mixture of water and solids with a sieve. Much is lost in the process. Unfortunately, the very magnificence of Freud's work cast a long, paralyzing shadow on the subject for well over fifty years, although Jung and others did sense a little of the nature of the essence that was escaping Freud's container. Without going into details of an alternate theory of dreaming, let me emphasize that I regard dreams as creative and aesthetic experiences that depict in the form of visual metaphors the present state of our connections and disconnections with the world about us.</p>

<p>For some time I had been toying with the idea that what we experienced as a dream had an antecedent history in an event that was beyond time and space ordering, and came upon us in something approaching an instantaneous happening at critical moments in the transformation of one form of consciousness to another. The onset of the dreaming phase is one such critical modal point. The black dot at the left in the accompanying figure represents this event. It may be regarded as a kind of black hole of the psyche containing an enormously condensed information mass. Since this falls completely outside the realm of our ordinary information processing capacities, it is experienced as ineffable. We are forced to let it expand, as it were, or unfold and then deal with it in bits and pieces, ordered as best we can in time and space. These are the visual images that make up the dream as depicted by the various shapes in the figure. The information is still highly condensed, less so than formerly, and is spread out before us. A second transformation occurs when we reach the waking state. Here we try to transform this private experience into a public mode. This requires a further unfolding of the information contained in the images and the translation of this information into a public medium of exchange, namely language. Here is where we get into trouble because the information goes beyond what can be conveyed in a discursive mode. Much of the information is more readily felt than described. Moreover, the engagement with the information at a feeling level is an experiment in growth. That black hole contains within it our personal expanding universe and we do both ourselves and the universe an injustice when we try to reduce it to a play of instincts. Comments by David Bohm have both provided me with a language fitting to this process, namely, the successive transformation of implicate into explicate, as well as the more important sense of support from another domain, the world of physics, for what is simply an intuitive surmise on my part. What is implicate at one stage becomes explicate in the next stage through a process of unfolding, and what is explicate at this stage becomes implicate for the next stage.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zftran-0.jpg" alt="Implicate to explicate diagram" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If we use dreams simply as illustrative of a broader range of phenomena, unattended to or inadequately attended to by the present focus of scientific inquiry, then four general features of these phenomena emerge:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are more readily appreciated than interpreted. Psychiatrists should have courses in dream appreciation rather than dream interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>They share with all aesthetic experiences the quality of transcending space and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Their specific domain is the connective tissue between people, the underlying matrix of human existence, the sense of contact or contactlessness between people.</p></li>
<li><p>They are all in one way or another the creative embodiment of unpremeditated responses to novelty. Dreams provide us with perhaps our most familiar experience with this in the way our dreams capture appropriate, socially derived images to express subjective events.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What is the agency that provides this unending source of unerringly apt visual metaphors? I don't think we honestly know the answer to this question, but I do know how easy it is to gloss over our ignorance by attributing the whole works to some reified, internal demon, variously known as Primary Process, our Unconscious, or simply, our Id. Perhaps a prior question would be, what is the nature of the process involved in the selection and organization of the visual images with which we build the content of our dream consciousness? If we look at the process simply, i.e., without an allegiance to deeply embedded theoretical biases, we seem to be involved in a rather intriguing process. We seem to be able to bring together a selected array of bits and pieces of past social data that have become known to us over the course of our personal life history, and then to rearrange the data in a spatial and temporal ordering, bearing no relationship to their original time-space frame of reference, but one which enables them, through the personal transformation we have wrought, to rather precisely, dramatically and effectively express the particular interplay of feelings mobilized by a current unresolved life situation. Social reality makes a significant contribution to our dreams. It provides us with the very special kinds of building blocks it takes to capture and express one or another aspect of our subjective life. When you stop to think about it, it takes a rather high level of creative and organizational ability to tap our own internal computer for the appropriate bits with which to solve the puzzle and then to rearrange them in a way that makes sense as a kind of emotional template, highlighting a problematic aspect of our immediate experience. Having gone this far, we are almost forced to admit that the powers displayed by our dreaming selves far exceed the scope of our waking faculties. The comparison is, of course, unfair, since each is supreme in its own domain. One is not better than the other; each is a powerful way of grasping different aspects of our existence. Our problem is that we have paid more attention to the one than to the other. This view of our dream suggests that we are capable of looking quite deeply into the face of reality and of seeing mirrored in that face the most subtle and poignant features of our constant struggle to transcend our own personal, limited, self-contained, autonomous self so as to better be able to connect with and be part of a larger unity. Just as someone once remarked, our eyes may be regarded as the means nature created in order to see itself, in the same way our dreams may be viewed as an instrument created by society to see itself and its distortions reflected in one of its own creations. We cannot understand the level and range of creativity displayed in this manner as having its source in the individual alone. It has to be understood as a function of the individual and society. The dream comes about because, in the interest of reaching out toward this sense of unity, each of us has turned our psyche to an exquisitely sensitive pitch with a capacity to store and use what we have seen, heard and learned intuitively of the world about us, and function as a vehicle for expressing everything from passion to prejudice. The world endlessly nourishes and replenishes these creative juices, although for some of us they come out only at night, and for all of us they are far more discerningly honest at night.</p>

<p>The homonomous approach to knowledge, if identified and worked with, provides the self with enormously powerful tools with which to effect change and transformation. Any system, including a given personality system, becomes more than it conceives itself to be when, in fact, it is shown to be more on the exposure and identification of these connecting channels to a larger reality.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>In the process of living, I often incubate a dream to get information. So, in keeping with the current Dream Network theme, I turned to dream incubation to give me additional understanding about the experience of living one's life as if it were a dream. </p>

<p>My incubated dreams are often quite understandable so I was expecting to get some quick and easy to understand information. Instead, I got a middle-of-the-night dream about a family that had been getting light over a period of years. The meaning of light as well as other dream elements, however, all lacked clarity. The dream itself seemed to be more like the waking process of ‘brainstorming’ often used to generate ideas. </p>

<p>After jotting down the dream, I had to use the bathroom. Without turning on any lights, I walked into the bathroom and saw a star through the window, beautifully framed by an opening in the surrounding tree branches. I realized that the light of the star could in some way be a continuation of the focus on light in my dream. As I turned from the window, my attention was caught by a lighted wall switch. The thought occurred to me that seeing lights could be the beginning of a waking nightmare experience if I allowed it to be. That realization triggered more thoughts of lights before I was able to bring the train of thought to a close. </p>

<p>I began walking back to the bedroom without switching on any lights that might disturb the sleep cycle. Even so, my eye caught the lighted switch in the hallway. Then, upon entering the bedroom, the lighted switch on the electric heater caught my attention. The realization came that if I didn’t jot down the unusual waking experience of noticing/seeing these lights, the recall might drift away in dream like fashion. So, I groped for my flashlight, and realized that I was faced with still another light. </p>

<p>Possibly the awareness of the parade of lights in my nighttime waking moments had been initiated by the dream theme of collecting light. The experience was not particularly pleasant. To eliminate the unpleasantness, I considered the more comforting thought that when we see “the light,” we’ve gotten the answer. Conflicting with that idea was a bunch of nighttime scribbles in my dream journal that contained no simple answer about waking as a dream. As the disappointment became clear, I heard a still small voice say, “Wonderful.” At hearing the voice, my resulting excitement blocked out whatever was supposed to be so wonderful. </p>

<p>So, I turned off my flashlight to go back to sleep. As I did so, I saw the glow from the digital display of my clock that I had carefully covered so I wouldn't see the light. Agh, more light. I figured that there must be a message here somehow about seeing the light. Next, I realized that I’d forgotten to put in my mouthpiece to avoid nighttime teeth grinding. So, I got up again and had difficulty finding it because the night-time glow built into its container had gone out. </p>

<p>The experience with light was becoming more complicated and difficult to understand. With relief, an idea came to mind from Ralph Blum’s The Book of Runes. He writes of the desire to immerse oneself in the experience of living “without having to evaluate or understand.” With that in mind, I could go back to sleep. </p>

<p>The next day, an old choir friend gave me a call. During the course of our conversation, I told her about my recent dream along with my intention to learn more about experiencing waking life as if it were a dream. She didn't seem to resonate with the topic. Instead, she said, “Well Arthur, you know the first thing God said was ‘Let there be light.’” She then proceeded to sing a song as a prayer for me that finished with “May God’s light shine on your face.” She brought our conversation to a close by repeating the last line of the song. </p>

<p>Later, as I sat back and contemplated the call, I realized that not only was the focus on light continuing in my life, but also that I’d been given a heart-felt gift. That gift of a blessing was related to immersing myself in and being conscious of my waking and dreaming experiences. My dream incubation process that had been designed to more fully understand waking as if one is in a dream certainly yielded unexpected results. The results were reminders of a number of factors including: the powerful effect of intention on our dreams and waking; the back-and-forth flow of information and emotions between dreams and waking; how the mystery of light is alive and well; the question about which comes first, the dream or the waking and finally, the un-predictability of life, the energy drain that can occur when trying to understand things, and the fact that there just aren’t any simple answers. Possibly most important, however, was the reminder that by immersing ourselves in life—and ‘The Light,’ we can experience satisfaction and a fullness that no amount of understanding can bring. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Whenever I am getting ready for a radio interview or a talk, I try to anticipate the questions. I usually get questions like … How can I remember my dreams? Do dreams answer questions? Do they foretell the future? What does the dream I had last night “mean?” </p>

<p>But on this particular talk show, I was thrown off a bit. The kind lady on the phone handed me a really simple, basic question. But it caused me to hesitate. To think a bit. </p>

<p>Her question: <strong>What is a dream?</strong></p>

<p>I thought back. Had any of the so called dream “experts” answered that question? I have noticed that most writers of dream books dive right in, assuming everyone knows what they are talking about when they discuss dreams. </p>

<p>The question is definitely worthy of a thoughtful answer. So here is my take on it. My response draws on my understanding of ancient wisdom and eastern philosophy. Our personalities have three aspects: the physical, the emotional, and the mental. The brain is part of the physical aspect. When we die, the physical aspect ceases to exist, but for some time we continue to experience emotion and retain our mental capabilities. </p>

<p>When we dream, we are experiencing a state of consciousness similar to death. Our physical senses are shut down, but our emotional and mental aspects are running full steam. Dream researchers tell us the brain is still functioning during dream periods. The motor and emotional areas of the brain are highly active, enabling us to actually “experience” the dream. But I think the dream is less a function of the physical brain than it is of the mind, an aspect of ourselves that transcends the physical. </p>

<p>In the dream state we are free from the distractions of waking life. Free from our day-to-day concerns. I compare it to the Hubble telescope. Scientists knew that to fully experience the universe they had to free themselves from the bounds of earthly atmospheric distractions. In the dream state you can experience whatever happens to you without thought of prejudice, of what it will cost, of who is watching you, of what will happen if you fail. Here your mind receives objective information. Even better, in the dream state you are connected to universal consciousness. You are able to see all the universe has to offer. Your dream is what you see in your Hubble telescope. </p>

<p><strong>What <em>is</em> a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information. A dream is what you would be thinking about if you weren’t so busy working, or buying things, or paying bills, or worrying, or seeking pleasure. </p>

<p>As you sleep, at the end of a day of working, buying things, paying bills, worrying, seeking pleasure, whatever … your mind processes these events and all the emotions associated with them. It considers them in relation to all that you are and all that you could be. Your mind selects a theme—an essential issue, idea, or perception— that your need brought to your consciousness at this point in your life. Your mind then attempts to present this theme in a form you can understand. </p>

<p>Most of us are accustomed to the narrative, storybook form. So, for most of us, the mind attempts to tell us a story. This story presents the issues you need to deal with in your waking life. These issues are normally things you know about but are avoiding or afraid to face. They may be things of which you are not yet conscious. </p>

<p>Of course, not everyone processes things in this narrative sense. For instance, artists may just experience visual images, with no storyline at all. </p>

<p>We are told that Billy Joel and Sting are given their musical inspiration in the dream state. I know a potter in Virginia who first “sees” her new projects in dreams. Artists, scientists, and other visionaries often experience ideas, perceptions, and new perspectives in their dreams. </p>

<p>At the point of waking from your dream, you have choices about what to do with your new-found objective information. You can ignore it and say, “It was just a dream.” Or you can act on this profound message that has come to move you forward, to take you to a new level of understanding about yourself and your world, to give you new insight into your skills and abilities and what you can produce. Someone said, “We cannot discover new oceans unless we have the courage to lose sight of the shore.” Dreams are asking you to be brave, to take a step forward into new adventures. They are asking you to explore the mystery. </p>

<p>True, they are normally filled with complicated symbolism. True, they are normally asking us to consider some degree of change in our lives. These concerns do not have to stop you in your tracks. I believe the quickest and best way to get past these hurdles is to seek out the core messages—the themes—our dreams are asking us to explore. </p>

<p>Consider a recent dream you have had. Ask yourself, what is the theme of this dream? Generally, did it deal with how you differentiate yourself from others, or how you express yourself, or how you interact with others, or how you capitalize on your experience? Think in terms of broad issues. For example, in the dream, did you experience need, vulnerability, success, failure, exploration, new discovery, adaptability, sharing, love, desire? Were you threatened or criticized? Did you have trouble communicating or applying your knowledge and skills? Did you feel out of control or restricted in some way? Were you surprised to learn there was some new world to explore or some new direction your work can take? </p>

<p>These are all common themes in dreams. But your specific dream is not “common.” It deals with you and your life. Ask yourself where in your waking life you are experiencing these issues or feelings or activities. Finally, look back at the details of the dream to see if it contains new information or clues about how to deal with waking life issues or how to develop and present new ideas or perceptions.</p>

<p><strong>What is a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information from deep within you and from the universe around you. It is coming to help you grow. To find your role in the world. To be the best you can be. To be free and to be whole. Honor it by acting on the specific message it is asking you to address. </p>

<p>For more information on themes and how to work with them in your daily dream work, I provide general information on my website, <a href="www.heartofthedream.com">www.heartofthedream.com</a>, and more detailed information in my book, Dream Exploration: A New Approach. ℘</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Inception</i>, 2010, directed by Christopher Nolan</div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>I am certain many viewers walked out of Inception with great delight at the concept. Its creative expression is brilliant. However, as someone who has been teaching Extraordinary Dreams such as lucid dreaming, dreams within dreams, mutual dreaming, for a very long time, I left the movie with some questions. </p>

<p>Although the movie draws attention to extraordinary experiences in dreams, I wonder about the message this film is conveying. Of course the movie is Science Fiction, but beyond every novel or any science fiction, there is scientific and narrative truth. In a recent interview, Chris Nolan stated that he did not do much research into dreaming and that the script is based primarily on his own experiences. His personal experience has provided him with enough qualitative material to convey states of consciousness that some people access easily while others manage to attain only through effort, incubation or invocation. </p>

<p>Whether the knowledge is gained from within or outside, the incorporation of his personal experience with dreams and literature in the movie is brilliant and the visuals are stunning... although the thriller content of chasing and killing were far from being original or interesting. Haven’t we all had those “recurring dreams”? Can we be thrilled with something else? </p>

<p>Maybe I am numbed by the state of the world conflict, but somehow taking a subject so incredible and inoculating it with another chasing theme is not an exciting dream-movie to me. Yes, the incorporation was fabulous... but such nightmares are no longer subconscious material. I was hoping that as the characters went (as they called it) “deeper,” that their subconscious would illuminate something different than that with which we are already surrounded. Perhaps there could have been a profound solution of how to go beyond our psychic warfare? Violence is no longer deep in the subconscious. Violence is what we deal with on a daily basis. We should not forget that at this moment violence is in our backyard, it is not in someone else's. It is not in the world of imagination, it is here. We just have to tune into world news on a daily basis. </p>

<p>The thrill for me as an audience was the anticipation of waiting to see if they could arrive at a place within consciousness where the seed of wisdom lies, beyond the reptilian brain of fight or flight. I suppose that was my dream: that they would reach a transformative state that not only elevated the characters to greater lucidity but also awakened the audience to new levels of consciousness. </p>

<p>In the movie, the last level they reached within the main character’s subconscious, was powerful psychological work and offered the kind of choice-making that lucid dreaming practices have been promoting for years. There was hope that we’d see emotional resolutions. Rather, the movie illustrated that such practices can cause delusions and thus the danger of not being able to distinguish the dream state from reality. This is a clear example of how great phenomena such as lucid dreaming can be taken out of context. </p>

<p>What I appreciated about the movie was the incredible creativity in visual animations, clever plot of dreams within dreams, perceptual play and the fact that, as an audience, we were captured in the layers of the repetitive dream within dreams to the extent of forgetting where the line is: the distinction between waking and dream reality? </p>

<p>The main actor (DiCaprio) performed beautifully, as do many of our dream characters. We are often caught in those dreams and we believe in them. The actress (Ellen Page) was truly the lucid one who practiced non-attachment to the emotional illusions and made the choices that kept the nightmare from turning into further tragedy. </p>

<p>Of course all of us in the field of dream studies will likely watch this movie over and over again. It provides a great topic for discussion about dreams, extraordinary experiences in dreams and waking reality. But I ask again, can we not create a larger vision, using higher states of consciousness to move beyond conflict, greed and violence? Perhaps as humans, we have no example of “what it is like” to be and live in such a state of consciousness. Is that why we keep repeating our old dreams? </p>

<p>Since Nolan is deeply interested in dreams, I hope, in his next film, that he continues to face the psychological shadow and move even deeper into the spaces of the Soul/Mind where he can allow the natural wisdom phenomena to reveal itself. Perhaps then we will see not only the resolution of the inner conflicts but the display of a workable solution for a world desperately in need of harmony. ∞</p>

<p>A good understanding of our dreams will lead us to a better understanding of ourselves. Recently a group of friends and I got together in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and started a dream group. The group is based on sharing out recent dreams and trying to help each other to better understand the meanings of the dreams. The goal of the group is to be more aware of ourselves through our dreams and to advance in self-realization. </p>

<p>A long time ago, I began to work with my dreams by setting my alarm clock to awaken me in the night at a time when, according to to the information about the REM cycle, I might be most likely to remember a dream. I had pen and notebook ready at hand for recording. Just about every time I awakened with the clock, I would write down some clues which would help me recall my dreams in the morning and record them in more detail. </p>

<p>Now I am habituated to remembering my dreams and I can tell when I am going into the waking state. I know that I can spend up to 10 minutes in this state, so I now rehearse the dreams in my memory, and fix the images in my mind. After waking up, I usually spend perhaps half an hour in bed thinking about the night of sleep and and dreams. The dreams that I first noted down in the middle of the night, I fill in with more detail as I write all the dreams I have been able recall. Working with the dreams begins right away as I write them down and think about them. Working with my dreams, remembering them and writing them down I have discovered that I have had precognitive dreams, lucid dreams, and dreams that led to the feeling of <em>deja vu</em> when awake. </p>

<p>Sometimes I make a sketch of a particularly important dream image. It is very helpful to sketch a dream right after waking - I try to capture the colors with colored pencils. Some dreams are so moving that just recording them in a journal is not enough - so I write them as poems. Sharing dreams with a close friend usually gives me some different perceptions of my dreams and of myself. It is almost like therapy, because a close friend is aware of my personal life and can often give me some insights. Working through my dreams makes me realize more about myself. This understanding has led me to some unexpected insights into my life!</p>

    ns1:description """<p>"Freud is right," I said to myself, somewhat incredulous as the psychology professor explained the id and the libido. "Freud is right," I said again and shook my head. It was 1980 and I was a psychology major at Drake University listening to a lecture on Freud's theory of the id, ego, superego and the libido. The instructor had outlined Freud's theory that the id-or the vast unconscious within one's psyche-was the source of the libido, the sexually based instinctual energy that fueled much of motivation and behavior. </p>

<p>At that moment, I felt Freud had illuminated an interesting aspect of my lucid dreaming-that the feeling of extraordinary energy when conscious in the dream. I reasoned that-if the dream state was located in the id or unconscious-then, when lucid, one was exploring the unconscious with one's conscious awareness. Freud's theory would seemingly predict that a dreaming person, in their id or unconscious, would definitely experience the libido energy. I thought back to my first five years of lucid dreaming experiences and recalled the incredible surge of energy that occurs when lucid-that deep, intense, sometimes ecstatic, often sexual, energy streaming through my awareness. I could only conclude that Freud might be on to something. </p>

<p>But what were others experiencing in their lucid dreams? Was this ecstatic energy common in lucid dreams? Or was it just me, a 20 year old junior in college with possible raging hormones and a penchant for lucid dreaming? </p>

<p>"Orgasm is a natural part of lucid dreaming," proclaimed Dr. Patricia Garfield in her fascinating book <em>Pathway to Ecstasy: The Way of the Dream Mandala</em>, first published in 1979. Drawing upon many of her lucid dream experiences with bold frankness and a penetrating eye for detail, she went on to write, "in fully two thirds of my lucid dreams, I feel the flow of sexual energy; this arousal culminates in an orgasmic burst on about half of those occasions." </p>

<p>Garfield's book unabashedly acknowledged a common denominator in lucid dreaming; namely that the shift from dreaming to conscious or lucid dreaming was normally accompanied by a special, energetic, inner feeling which often was ultimately directed by the dreamer to sexual expression. Lucid dreamers would often write, "I know I am dreaming. I want to have fun. Feeling amorous, I look down an empty street and desire a man. Suddenly I see a man ...."</p>

<p>What else might explain this desire for sexual expression? In lucid dreams, the senses are often very acute and vivid. Touching often seems hypersensitive. Coupled with a feeling of energy and freedom, this tactile intensity may encourage further sensuousness or sex. Also in lucid dreams, one is aware of safety, ensconced in a creation of ones own making. Directing the action to pleasurable activities is easily achieved and often free from waking or moralistic concerns. One lucid dreamer's fantasy: "I realized I was dreaming and stepped into the school room. I saw there were a few women there. Feeling amorous, I decided to announce that I wanted to see more attractive women when I re-entered the room. I stepped out into the hallway, shut the door and waited. I reopened the door with a definite feeling of expectation. A line of attractive nude women stood looking back at me. It was amazing!" </p>

<p>Of course in many lucid dreams, there is no overt or apparent covert sexual action or imagery or only a part may be directed to sexual expression. The majority of the lucid dream may be directed to exploring the lucid dream state: flying, transforming dream object or events, talking to dream characters, or predetermined goals of the lucid dreamer. </p>

<p>Experienced lucid dreamers learn to contravene the sexual component for two basic reasons. They learn that excessive emotions can terminate a lucid dream. Therefore intense sexual feelings may cause lucidity to end, much like overloading -a circuit breaker. An example illustrates this: "I pulled her close and could feel her breasts as I reached under her sweater. But then the emotional intensity was building and I could tell that the lucid dream was about to end."</p>

<p>Second, a lucid dreamer may have a particular goal in mind, actively choosing to ignore a sexual situation. One lucid dreamer wrote, "I brush against one of the women as I stand up, then I realize that this is a lucid dream! I look at my hands for a moment to stabilize things. As I look up again, one of the women is now wearing only underwear. I ignore her because I have a desire to experiment. I see the wall in front of me with old wallpaper and decide to walk through it and experience that as I do so, I have a funny perception, kind of a half second of 'brown vision,' which I assume is my visualization of the wall internally."</p>

<h2>Flying, Sex and Ecstasy</h2>

<p>Most experienced lucid dreamers agree that some degree of sexual activity occurs in many lucid dreams. An informal survey found that their favorite activity when lucid was flying; sexual expression was their second.</p>

<p>Freud drew a linkage to flying as a dream symbol for sexual expression in his book The Interpretation of Dreams. Reflecting upon childhood 'romping' and the giddy excitement of being swung about by adults, Freud concluded, "Not infrequently in these motion games, innocuous in themselves, sexual feelings will be aroused". Is there a connection between flying and sex in lucid dreams? It may be an association with ecstasy- "a state of exalted delight in which normal understanding is felt to be surpassed" -or from the Greek, ek-stasis, "to displace, drive out one's senses". Lucid dreams are in some sense ecstatic; they jar us out of "stasis' or standstill. They shift our consciousness. They force us into a new awareness that provides the energy to express freedom, intensity and joy in a symbolic way, such as flying, sexual union or transcendental experiences. </p>

<p>I found that Patricia Garfield reached a similar conclusion, "...we are stimulating an area of the brain or a chain of responses that is associated with ecstatic states of all sorts. Sensations of flying, sexual heights, acute pleasurable awareness, and a sense of oneness are all natural outcomes of a prolonged lucid dream." This sense of ecstasy may generalize to a number of diverse but highly pleasurable dream behaviors or actions, linked through inner associational processes. </p>

<h2>Symbolism in Lucid Dreams</h2>

<p>Although the lucid dreamer's sexual activities are normally consciously directed by their conscious intent, other parts of the dream (the setting, the atmosphere, the action of the dream characters) are not typically consciously directed but simply accepted by the lucid dreamer. This suggests that the symbolic function of a dream continues in the background, while accommodating the consciously directed activities of the lucid dreamer. This lucid dreamers' account may express this:</p>

<p><em>I am wearing a long, red slip dress over a white top ... and marveling at such a wonderful dream scene. I still want sex. I go through the house looking for someone. I even go down to the basement... I see a light coming from the furnace area.</em></p>

<p>The red dress may symbolically express, fashion-wise, this lucid dreamer's sexual urge, though it wasn't consciously chosen. Similarly, the light coming from the furnace area may suggest the dreamer's heat, fire, or passion. The dream continues:</p>

<p><em>I look out the front door and see R ... I know it is a dream version of R so it's okay to have sex with him ... I tell him let's go down there, as I point to the brook area and the tall reeds ... I lay floating supported by the reeds ... I hope Dad can't see me out the window ... I remind myself that I'm dreaming and it doesn't matter who sees. R may not even be there anymore but I experience an orgasm anyway.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zlucse-0.jpg" alt="Lucid couple among the reeds" width="400px"/></p>

<p>The setting of tall reeds and brook may symbolically reflect the sexual action.</p>

<p>In many lucid dream accounts, one reads of the dreamer wrestling with where to have their sexual activity: in the open, in the closet, with no one present, with many others present, etc., all of which may have symbolic significance. One lucid dreamer felt his experience shed 'light' on his inner feelings:</p>

<p><em>I was lucid, and seemed to be in an attic with Jots of boxes and chests around. For some reason the lighting was very dim, and shadowy. I saw a woman there, and knowing this was a dream, decided to have sex with her. In the next moment. her clothing was gone and she was looking towards me as she sat on the floor with her legs open. As I moved closer. I may have been thinking about the darkness for a second and then the oddest thing happened, a shaft of light from above shone down directly upon her vaginal It was like a theatrical stage light had suddenly turned on. Boom! It totally lit up with a brilliant white light! I laughed with delight.</em></p>

<p>The dreamer felt the scene in the attic may have reflected his thinking about issues of sex and spirituality.</p>

<h2>Lucidity, Sex and Physiology</h2>

<p>Garfield also hints that there may possibly be a physiological component in lucid dreaming and sex. Later, research reported by Dr. Stephen LaBerge in his book Lucid Dreaming, states that "lucid dreaming occurs during a highly activated phase of REM sleep, associated, as a result, with increased vaginal blood flow or penile erections." While this is an interesting point, one can only wonder if the physiological event is being driven by the dream cognitions or if the dream cognitions are an artifact of physiological activities. </p>

<p>In a separate 1983 sleep laboratory study, LaBerge asked a female lucid dreamer to signal through rapid eye-movements that she was lucid dreaming, and then signal when she was nearing orgasm in the lucid dream. The physiological measures of heightened respiration, and vaginal muscle activity and pulse amplitude matched her lucid dream signaling. This indicated that the sexual dream content was reflected in physiological changes. In many ways, the experience was 'real,' mentally and physiologically. This study suggests to me that the dream cognitions drive the physiology. </p>

<p>Twenty-six years ago when I first began to dream consciously or lucidly at age 16, my very first lucid dreams did not have sexual elements in them. What they had, however, was an extraordinary sense of near ecstasy -- a deep swelling sense of energy, feelings of complete and utter freedom, and an astounding visual and mental clarity. These ecstatic feelings were often most acute when flying. </p>

<p>When talking with other lucid dreamers about their first lucid dream, no one has ever mentioned sex in their first lucid dream. However, many have mentioned a feeling of near ecstasy and joy, often accompanied by flying. At some later point, most lucid dreamers learn they can direct the energy of the dream towards sexual expressions. </p>

<p>These points may suggest that the energy felt in a lucid dream is an experience of a basic or universal creative energy with the sexual component being one part, which we learn through association or conscious desire to pursue. In a similar vein, Carl G. Jung broke with Freud's view of the libido as primarily sexual and came to view the libido as a psychic energy, an expression of the "intensity of the psychic process." </p>

<h2>Id, Ego, Libido, Lucidity: Why does it matter?</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Freud made an attempt to conceptualize the Psyche, how it was composed, how it functioned or dysfunctioned. He likened the conscious to the tip of an iceberg supported by a massive unconscious underneath. Dreams were very important in this schema, because dreams expressed symbolically the activity of the unconscious and shed light on one's motivations, perceptions and behaviors.</p>

<p>One hundred years later, what do we really understand of the Psyche and the role of dreams in it? Robert Bosnak's book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>, explored this area. He strenuously questioned "Who is the dreamer?" in his attempt to understand the fantastic, awesome, incredible creativity of dreams and "who" was behind them. Similarly I ask "Where is the dreamer? Where do we place the dreamer in our conception of the psyche?" Moreover, "If the dreamer is in the Unconscious, then where is the lucid dreamer?" And finally, "If the lucid dreamer is aware in the Unconscious, why do we not use lucid dreamers to begin to map out the characteristics of the Unconscious-the characteristics of the Psyche?" </p>

<p>The commonality of experience of lucid dreamers as they consciously act in the dreaming environment suggests that there may be a framework, a set of principles, of unconscious processes available in dreaming to be theorized and tested. If these principles could be explored and identified, then we could move beyond general conceptualizations and more clearly define the reality of the dream state and perhaps, the unconscious. </p>

<p>As minister and dreamworker Jeremy Taylor has said many times, "Dreams come to enhance our health and wholeness." All dreams, including lucid ones, are an opening to our wholeness. Let's find the dreamer. Let's claim our wholeness.  </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Dreams are a very important aspect of our daily lives that need more conscious attention and consideration. Whether we dream in vague snippets or full-blown epic movies, the information your sleeping mind is sharing should not be overlooked. With more focus and value given to your dreams, you will remember more dreams and learn incomparable lessons. </p>

<p>I have found that dreams can fall into ten different categories. When approaching dreams, know that several categories may apply to one dream. The deeper you explore, the more levels of meaning you can find. I present these categories so that you may begin to look at your own dreams to discover the multidimensional aspects within these nightly scenarios. </p>

<h2>1. Daily Wash or Review Dreams</h2>

<p>These are the most common of dreams and, unfortunately, are often easily dismissed. An example might be: you have dinner with a friend and that night you dream about having dinner with this friend. In the dream, you have all the food on your side of the table as your friends sits there watching you eat. Suddenly, she begins crying uncontrollably. Then, as you watch, she turns into a small, wounded bird fluttering on the chair, seeming to cry out for attention. You are then changed in to a colorful parrot talking a mile a minute. There are several possible reasons for having this type of dream: </p>

<p>a) The dream might be showing you explicitly the choices you made. With the food on your side of the table, you become aware that you were the one nourished through your encounter with your friend.</p>

<p>b) The dream might be sharing reactions you overlooked. Your subconscious picks up on subtle emotional nuances and presents them to you in the dream. Your friend was upset and you were not consciously aware of this, thus your dream presents her emotional state in a dramatic version so that you will listen. </p>

<p>c) A third reason for this type of dream might be to act as a character study. Through these bird symbols, you clearly understand each of your roles from the previous evening. In a waking state you can now correct the imbalances from your dinner by calling to listen, support and nourish your friend. Rather than quickly tossing these dream images aside, look more closely into the messages behind dreams. Please don't dismiss any dream fragments or "obvious" messages; dreams are more complex and deserve your attention. </p>

<h2>2. Character Review Dreams</h2>

<p>Most characters presented in dreams are an aspect of yourself. When you dream about your mother she is likely to be personifying an aspect of yourself of which you may not be aware. When friends from the past pop up in a dream, you should look back either to your relationship with them or the time period you knew them to see what messages they present. The "character review" category can serve several functions: </p>

<p>a) It can highlight your own strengths. Perhaps your dream shows positive aspects about yourself that you are presently overlooking. For example, you dream about a beautiful dancer being showered with roses upon her curtain call. She then presents the roses to you backstage. The dream is showing your potential for sharing creativity with others and being rewarded. However, consciously you have put these talents "backstage" and the dream is showing you the rewards of bringing them "on stage". </p>

<p>b) It can point out weaknesses. You dream about standing in line, then you get stuck in traffic and then your date is late. When you awaken, you see the comedy in this frustrating dream and understand your own need to be patient with circumstances that are out of your control. </p>

<p>c) It can also give suggestions for balancing. You dream about being chained to your desk with mounds of work in front of you. Meanwhile, outside the window, you see people playing. You wake up knowing that "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," and you vow to take more time for yourself. </p>

<h2>3. Problem Solving Dreams.</h2>

<p>Dreams are very helpful, like a good friend trying to relay messages to you... all you have to do is ask. There are several ways these problem solving tools can be used. </p>

<p>a) Dreams can present business or study advice. One night, I gave myself a pre-sleep suggestion about whether to take a job I was considering. That night, I dreamt that I was walking a close, unidentified friend to the elevator in a high rise apartment building. I turned to go back down the hall to my apartment. Suddenly, the elevator cable snapped and I heard the elevator crash to the bottom, my friend screaming. I woke up and immediately knew I shouldn't take this particular job because it could" crash" to the ground and in the process I would lose something close to me.</p>

<p>b) Dreams can aid in interpersonal clarification. You are having some misunderstandings with your spouse and you go to bed upset. That night, your dream shows you some key to this conflict, and you awaken with a resolution and a better understanding of your partners feelings. </p>

<p>c) They can give clues for the best choice to be made. Perhaps you are considering moving and have narrowed your choice down to several locations. Still undecided, you go to sleep and you dream about the most appropriate location for you. Dreams may not be presented in a literal scenario, but when working with the symbols of the dream, the deeper meaning becomes much more evident. Listen to your own inner voice or "heart" to validate your impressions. As the dreamer, you will know when you've "gotten" the message from your dream. </p>

<p>d) Finally, dreams can share suppressed emotions about a situation. In college, my sister and I had many misunderstandings. I dreamt shortly before shew as getting married that her best friend and I completely missed the wedding. We showed up without our bridesmaids' dresses on, embarrassed to be so late. My dream warned me about my negative feelings and how they could potentially sabotage my sister's wedding. </p>

<h2>4. Body &amp; Health Awareness Dreams.</h2>

<p>Dreams can:</p>

<p>a) Show imbalances</p>

<p>b) Give health-aid suggestions</p>

<p>c) Share mental or emotional effects on the body. </p>

<p>Perhaps you dream about a vicious dog attacking your stomach and ripping out your intestines. Your doctor (or someone you don't actually know in waking life, but this person reminds you of your doctor) appears, leading a cow. You awaken, aware that this stomach pain could be a serious problem, perhaps an ulcer. Your dream shows the importance of making an appointment to see your doctor and that you should drink more milk to soothe your ulceric problems. The dog is showing how your uncontrollable anger, even if suppressed, is the cause of this attack on your stomach and intestines. Dreams are not always presented so simplistically as these examples, and you may not be aware of their meaning upon waking; however, if given attention, dreams will make their meaning clear and relay their individually unique message. </p>

<h2>5. Inspiration Dreams.</h2>

<p>a) Dreams can give specific answers to questions. My brother, a computer scientist, has told me of going to bed exhausted from working on an unsolved issue. In the morning, the solution to the problem is clear! Dreams used for problem solving and inspiration have been greatly noted by a variety of people such as scientists, writers and other artists, and business people. </p>

<p>b) Dreams can show creativity in action. During college, I was taking a choreography class. I took a short nap before rehearsal one day. In my dream, I woke up at 6:10 pm., although the meeting was to begin at 5:00. I dashed over to the studio and everyone had already been working for over an hour. In the dream, we completed the dance and felt very creative. When I woke up, it was indeed 6:10pm. AGH! My partners had left by then without working on our project. The next day, I shared the dance ideas presented in my dream and many of these ideas were incorporated into our final dance project! So my dreams were working on my dance project even though my body was sleeping. </p>

<p>c) Dreams can provide motivation to continue in a specific creative endeavor. As an actress, there are times when I lose sight of my goals. Usually during this time, I will dream of being cast in a great role and I wake up with renewed determination. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Author's Note: Dreams come in many forms with many messages and levels of interpretation. I have found that dreams fall into ten different categories. These categories overlap, giving varied depth of meaning to even "simple" dreams. I previously discussed the first five categories (DNJ Vol. 11 No.1). Now I'd like to complete the list so that you may use this to cross-reference your own dreams. It is very important to remember and give attention to these nightly scenarios.</em> </p>

<h2>6. Bad Dreams or Nightmares</h2>

<p>Everyone has had a bad dream at some point in their lives. Often these are the only dream experiences remembered. With an on-rush of adrenaline, you wake with a start and the emotions overwhelm you while reliving those scary scenes. "Bad" dreams, above all, should be paid close attention. There are several possible reasons for these types of dreams. </p>

<p>a) Nightmares shock you into remembering and/or facing certain fears, emotions, or blocks. Your conscious mind hasn't gotten the message (you don't remember the "simpler" dreams or else you don't pay attention to their messages). So your subconscious "slaps you awake" with a scenario that is so dramatic that you will remember and with such an emotional impact that it has an effect! Unfortunately, most people treat nightmares as "only a dream". Instead, the dreamer should view these dreams as highly important - kind of a last, drastic attempt by the subconscious to get through. Take a look at the dream characters and actions, break them down to specific characteristics and see how they might apply to your waking life. </p>

<p>b) They are acting out possible negative scenarios to release negative energy. It shows you that waking reality isn't so bad. All actors are familiar with "the actor's nightmare". You go out on stage to do a musical and suddenly the rest of the cast is doing Shakespeare. You're in the wrong costume and you don't know any of the lines! AGH! At the next rehearsal in your waking life, everyone else is still doing the same show you thought you were in. Relieved by this affirming reality, you have more confidence as you step onto the stage. </p>

<p>c) Nightmares personify negative feelings in order to deal better with fears. Shirley MacLaine, at her Higher Self Seminar, shared a recurring childhood nightmare. In the dream, she was being chased by a huge, mean gorilla. She ran and ran, barely keeping out of reach of the gorilla. Finally, she came to the edge of a cliff. This is where she usually woke up - terrified! One night, she was having the same dream, only this time when she reached the edge of the cliff, she turned. "What do you want?" she cried out to the gorilla. He replied, "I don't know, little girl. It's your dream." This humorous anecdote shows how we create the scary images from our dreams and we can control the outcome. By understanding what is behind our fear, we can overcome the possible negative outcome and make that dream character our ally. </p>

<p>d) Coming out of the dream state into a more wakeful state, the conscious mind can become aware of and evaluate the dream material. Those dreams where you are berng chased but can't move are likely to be times when the conscious mind checks in on the dream, yet realizes the body is "frozen" in its R.E.M. stage, thus the feeling of not being able to move. The conscious mind doesn't realize that this state is a dream and panics, waking you up in distress. Please don't brush aside these bad dreams just to relieve yourself. These are important dreams with important messages and should be given your waking focus. If you ignore these dreams, then the problems or difficult situations are almost forced to manifest in your waking life. </p>

<h2>7. Clarification Dreams</h2>

<p>Further dreams can:</p>

<p>a) Clarify previous dreams</p>

<p>b) Give a clearer message </p>

<p>c) Using the same symbol, show a different scenario that clarifies that symbol. </p>

<p>For example, I had several dreams about my highschool vocal coach. The first time I dreamt about him, I assumed the dream content would relate to his life at that time. Since we are still friends, I contacted him, but he could not confirm the dream's message as relating to him. So I asked my dreams for clarification. My next dream dealt with my own career progress at that time and was easily interpreted. Again, I asked for dream clarification about my former voice teacher. The next time I dreamt about this man, I clearly understood that he represented a time when I was very clear about my career aspirations. He had personally been very supportive of my desires. He, as a symbol, represented the support of those goals. Now when he appears in my dreams, it is usually at a time when I really need this support.</p>

<h2>8. Assistance for Others</h2>

<p>They can give:</p>

<p>a) General aids</p>

<p>b) Insight into specific problems (often seen symbolically rather than literally)</p>

<p>c) Symbolic understanding of trends and probable future events. Just like in your own "body and health awareness" dreams, you can pick up on health problems in a close friend or family member. But it doesn't have to be specifically health-related. You can dream about a brother who is overworking himself; in the dream he begins to make mistakes, eventually getting fired. You can check with this brother to see if he is indeed overworking himself. In any dream that seems to deal directly with another person, check with that other person first to see if the dream has significance for them. However, whether it has significance for the other or not, realize that you had the dream for a reason! Maybe you are overworking yourself and can't see it, so the dream non-threateningly shares this information. It is important to take the dream content back to the dreamer and apply the messages and symbols, however subtle, to the dreamer's personal life. </p>

<h2>9. Psychic Awareness Dreams</h2>

<p>This category gets the most phenomena attention. Most people have had at least one form of psychic awareness through a dream. The most common are:</p>

<p>a) Connections with "other world" people. Your grandmother has died recently and one night you dream that she visits to tell you that she is all right and very safe. "There is nothing to fear in death. I am still with you", she shares. Another common experience is </p>

<p>b) Telepathy about past, present or future events for: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yourself. For example, you dream about skidding on the ice and your car swerves off the road. The next day as you travel in those winter conditions seen in your dream, you are particularly cautious. Your car hits the ice patch and you are able to correct your car before sliding off into the ditch. </p></li>
<li><p>Your friends or family. You dream that your mother falls down the stairs. The next day, because of your awareness from this dream, you stop by your mother's house and arrive just after she indeed has fallen. By your prompt arrival, the situation turns out to be much less serious. </p></li>
<li><p>Your community. Many people in a community often dream about a significant event that will happen in their area. For example, some might dream about a tornado hitting their town. When weather conditions sour a few days later, they are more prepared to face the potential disaster. </p></li>
<li><p>National or global. Several people, including the President, foresaw Lincoln's assassination in their dreams. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, the important thing to do with these clairvoyant dreams is first to react to them literally. Then look internally to see why that dream might have significance for you personally. Perhaps your emotional life is about to experience a "tornado" and you need to go within to your "shelter" to withstand the impending storm. A third psychic category is:</p>

<p>c) Past-life memories. You awaken from a very vivid dream about life during King Arthur's reign. The dream seems so much more "real" than waking life. All day you can't shake the images. Perhaps you are tuning into past-life memories of a life during that time period. As with any past-life work, it is important to apply any insights, messages or lessons to the present. By tuning into that past life during King Arthur's reign, you may rekindle that feeling of a noble and charitable life, when standing up for "right" did enable "might". </p>

<h2>10. Spiritual Connection Dreams</h2>

<p>These dreams can share: </p>

<p>a) Spiritual lessons</p>

<p>b) Universal truths</p>

<p>c) Unconditional love </p>

<p>d) Connection with "angels", guides, teachers, your Higher Self, and God. </p>

<p>I had an incredible dream experience a few years ago that falls under this category. The dream was very long and complicated, but one section I'd like to share: </p>

<p><em>I was with a close friend. When I looked over at him, we zoomed out of our bodies and flew up high over the earth. The earth looked so clear and beautiful. When we returned to earth, we did not rejoin our bodies. Instead, when I looked at my friend, I saw only his etheric body, vibrant energy and light! As I looked into this energy field, I saw in a flash (not like in a movie, but instant knowing) all of his many lives and experiences. When I looked down at my own energy field, I was of the same type of energy and light and also knew all that I'd ever experienced. We discussed the many choices we'd made and laughed at how complicated we'd made life, how many times we'd lost perspective. Then an overwhelming feeling of unconditional love swept over me.</em></p>

<p>It was like <em>nothing</em> I'd ever experienced before! This experience left me with a heightened perspective and love flowed over into all areas of my life. </p>

<p>Dreams are a precious gift we receive nightly. By learning to remember and unravel the various layers, dreams can add a special awareness to our loves and the choices we make. Dreams can be likened to a nightly therapy session. The only cost is the attention to explore these rich, nightly scenarios. Keep these categories in mind when viewing your own dreams and good luck in this rewarding avenue of personal discovery. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Dreaming The Soul Back Home: Shamanic Dreaming for Healing and Becoming Whole By <a href="../@robertmoss">Robert Moss</a> New World Library, June 15, 2012</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>We suffer pain or trauma or abuse.  We are compelled to make a painful life choice, such as leaving a partner or a job or a home, and part of us resists that choice and still clings to the old relationship or the old place. Sometimes the choice is not even ours and we experience a deep sense of loss. We fall into depression or addiction or make compromises with the world as we understand it, thus giving up on our big dreams of life and leaving a piece of us behind. </p>

<p>We all know the pain of needing to let go, while continuing to hold on for dear life. We ebb and we flow, we gain and we lose, we love and we long for. Meanwhile our dreams remind us that we have left something behind, a part of our self, a part of our soul.</p>

<p>Bestselling author and world-renowned dream explorer Robert Moss addresses this subject in his newest book, <em>Dreaming The Soul Back Home: Shamanic Dreaming for Healing and Becoming Whole</em>. Moss understands that these challenging life situations often create a loss of our vital life energy and identity, and he adroitly speaks to the healing affects that dreams have on recovering these lost aspects of our souls. </p>

<p><em>Dreaming the Soul Back Home</em> is a practical tool and experiential guide in soul recovery and of all of Moss’s books, this is my favorite. “Dreams not only show us what the soul wants, they also show us where it has gone,” writes Moss. He teaches us about soul loss, what it is, how it happens, and how dreams come to us to assist in the healing process. He shares common presentations of dream imagery that we can all relate to when some aspect of soul loss has affected us. “We dream again and again of the old place, or Grandma’s house, or high school, or the house we shared with a former partner. These dreams may be telling us that we left part of our vital energy and identity in that phase of our lives. Or, we may dream of a younger same-sex companion and find we are dreaming of a younger aspect of ourselves that went missing at her age because of bad things that were happening… Again and again in dreams, our higher or Greater Self comes stalking us, giving us the chance to forge a connection that may bring more of soul or spirit into the body than was with us before.”</p>

<p>Dreams, in their infinite wisdom and homeopathic nature help us to reunite with these lost parts of ourselves so that we may bring more of our spirit back into our body to live a fuller, more complete life. Infused with an indigenous quality in approach, this is a breakthrough book on a subject that deserves deep attention and care because we all experience this type of soul loss at some point in our lives. </p>

<p><em>Dreaming the Soul Back Home</em> consists of 15 chapters, including Dreamers as Shamans, Understanding Soul Loss, Dream Roads to Wholeness, The Royal Road to Soul Recovery, House of Healing and Ancestral Healing and Spiritual Release. Numerous exercises are given throughout the book allowing the reader to work with his various techniques first-hand. In addition, Moss shares many examples of the ways in which soul speaks to us through dreams.</p>

<p>This book is a must-have for anyone who is interested in dreamwork because it is so unique and insightful. I found myself fascinated by every chapter and I experienced epiphanies throughout my entire reading of Moss’s book. He shared new ways of working with dreams that I had not considered and I embraced the idea of becoming my own shaman so that I could help promote my own healing and wholeness. This book is an exquisite addition to the dreaming community and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys working with dreams for personal growth, development and healing.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zmstar-0.jpg" alt="Constellations" /></p>

<p>There are times when Dreams take us on unexplored roads to learn new things. Such is my case. Several years back I had dreams where I was specifically requested to look up information about the Constellation of Bootes and I did so. But, that’s all I did; I learned a few details about what Astronomers knew then about Bootes and let it go recorded and forgotten into my dream journal. I didn’t bother, at the time, to integrate any information about Bootes to anything pertinent in my life.</p>

<p>Time passed and then I was again presented with the opportunity to learn something new, only this time it did not come as easily. I dreamt that...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am talking with a wonderful middle-aged man who is obviously avery good friend of mine, even though in real life I do not know this person. We talk about our families and hobbies and then decide to take a walk. We walk for a while, then enter a restaurant and sit down to eat something. I look out the window closest to me and see some reflected shadowy movement. I standup, move in closer to take a good look and see two beautiful peacocks, red and shimmering in glowing red light. I am so enthralled with the view that I call out to my friend and tell him I am seeing two very eccentric, red peacocks shimmering in red light! My friend comes overfrom the table, looks at them,smiles and tells me, “They are not eccentric, this is the way they are supposed to be... and still are!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke that morning feeling very well but knowing that I had to go learn about the “two red peacocks.”I knew the message inherent in the dream was important and decided to hit the search engines and see what I could come up with. I looked up “Peacock” in mythology and learned a lot in that area. I kept looking up the birds’ habits and felt it was nice information but nothing that really made me feel that I had come uponthe right interpretation. Being bilingual, I placed the word “Peacock” in Spanish, “Pavo,” and the Constellation of Pavo was displayed on the screen. As I read the description of the Constellation and learned it was made up of two very uneven but bright red primary and companion stars, I sensed that this was the information I was seeking.</p>

<p>I translated most of the article into Spanish and emailed it to my study group in South America. The response came quickly. About two days later they advised me that the investigation for “Pavo” was underway! They were to investigate and correlate some important spiritual facts about this constellation and they thanked me for the information. Needless to say that if I was confused at first on how to get information on the peacocks, I was evenmore confused when it was confirmed that the information received in my dream was correct and needed! It was a very powerful realization to learn how little knowledge I had of the heavens regarding Astronomical and Astrological points of view.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of new work habits in my dream journals. Everytime I had a dream, I went straight to an astrological calendar and took a look at what was happening up there in the sky. I did not even know what I was looking for, but I took a tremendous leap of faith and knew that someone who did know about Astrology would show up and could interpret the symbols for me. From another magazine I looked up the “fixed star” of the day and investigated the mythology behind that. This proved to be particularly helpful in understanding the “hidden opinion” behind the dream. I would then look up the Astronomer’s favorite picture for the day on the internet and also wrote it down. Another great leap of faith; since I had begun to understand the interrelatedness of everything, I knew the Cosmos up there somehow had to resonate with what was happening down here... and that the Astronomer’s sense of beauty would pick the right picture for the day.</p>

<p>Writing it all down took time, great effort, research and some experimentation so as to learn what informationwas pertinent, but it was well worth the time. I also learned that I could not choose one science above the other, but had to learn “scientifically“ from Astronomy about the wonderful Universe that surrounds us as well as the ancient mythological interpretations that were given by Astrologers. All of these two areas were important and interrelated in my dreams. As I became more familiar with these areas, wonderful new revelations were opened to me. When researching the information, the dates coincided with happenings up in the skies and cosmos.</p>

<p>The more familiar I became with Astronomical terms and visual identification of celestial bodies and Astronomy’s new discoveries, the more information I started receiving...with more “realistic and closely related visuals.” It was not long before all the detail work started to connect very well within my dreams. I would receive specific, wonderful gifts during Leonid or Quadrantid Meteor Showers, Equinoxes or Solstices. It was wonderful to discover that for several years, my healing dreams came to me during the same dates. I will never be a professional Astronomer nor Astrologer, but realize that for dreamers everywhere, these tools can be of great help and service. Using the Internet to navigate related, great sites can provide easytoreach research tools and there is free software that will allow you to keep track of the moon phases and astronomical visuals that can help, too.</p>

<h3>DREAM AUGUST 2001</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am visiting a building that specializes in Advertising and Public Relations. I am looking for someone in particular to discuss some details about something (I do not remember). I walk into a room and see thatit is in the process of being renovated, I walk into another and seethat this room is filled and busy with very delicate machinery. I walk towards the wall and notice a table with three transparent, flat, acrylic screens that are showing magnificent pictures, mainly in shades of red, orange, some grey and pockets of black. As I walk closer, I notice that the three screens are showing three sections of some remarkable picture from Space. I do not know what it is, but I know it is from outer Space. I ask the Office Manager what these are but she smiles and does not tell me. Regarding this dream, the moon was in Perigee to the Earth and it would be further clarified by the...</em></p>

<p>I awaken screaming and go get my dream journal. My painting of the beautiful three acrylic screens and the inside cover page present the same image! It’s the center of the Galaxy as processed by the twin telescopes “Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)” in Arizona and Chile, in which they have captured the Milky Way galaxy and galaxies that lie beyond.</p>

<p>This dream genuinely surprised me. I felt the light and understood, once again, that it might have something to do with what was happening out in Space. I did more research and learned that the Earth would be in Perihelion to the Sun on January the 4th, and the Moon would be in Perigee to the Earth on January 10th. I understood then the uneven sized knobs could be representing the Earth and Moon. It was a wonderful dream!</p>

<p>I decided to use this dream as one of the three that are presented in this article, since it was taking place in a “building dedicated to Advertising and Public Relations.” My study group and I all had a good laugh at my reaction and it’s nice to have confirmation, once again, that dreams relate to what’s happening all around us... on many levels. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Familiar themes and symbols emerge to most people who record their dreams. They are components that parallel their lives above and below conscious awareness. Do these themes and symbols form pieces of your own mythology? Since dreams dip into the world of the unconscious to select their stories and dramas, they tap both the personal and collective unconscious for dream material, thus forming a unique relationship between your personal mythology and your dreams. </p>

<p>What is the definition of "myth"? Webster defines it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"...a traditional story of ostensible historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief or natural phenomenon." [1] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do your dreams reveal your world view? Certainly, your personal history is reflected through your dreams in regard the content you select from your life activities to play out in your dreams. Thus, your dreams reflect your personal 'myths' - ones in which your personal relationship can change and transform, just as your life experiences do. </p>

<p>However, the collective unconscious component adds a deeper layer to the meaning of your dreams with the appearances of the archetypal themes and symbols which reflect the primitive and ancient part of your personal mythology: Arthur Cotterell explains that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The myth in a primitive society ... was the recognition of the link between past and present established by myth in daily life. ...Jung became convinced that the individual possessed both a personal and collective unconscious; the former filled with material peculiar to the individual whereas the latter housed the common mental inheritance of mankind - the archetypes, or primordial images which 'bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote past. This psychic life .. is the mind of our ancient ancestors, the way in which they conceived of life and the world, of gods and human being.' ... No doubt the creative period of myth is set in prehistoric times.'' [2] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you track your own personal mythology through your dreams? Those who have kept dream journals for more than five years will have ample material to process; begin by reading through them finding frequent images/scenarios that you notice. Jot them down and see how your world view/ psyche has changed, remained the same or intensified - is it a map for the evolution of your own life pattern? Have your myths outgrown you - or you them? But no matter how long you have journaled - whether a novice recording the magic of the dream world or one who is well-seasoned, you will be able to recognize the emergence of your own myth material. </p>

<p>For example, several of my older dream themes had to do with hotel/motel settings; that is, temporary way stations on a journey to somewhere. It reflected my internal as well as external search for "home". Since I have found what I call home both within and in the physical world , the occurrence of a hotel or motel setting in my dreams generally has diminished. </p>

<p>Similarly, there has been an increase in circular-shaped symbols in my dreams during the past few years. For me, this equates to the archetype of the integration process of the self wanting to coalesce and evolve through internal processes. </p>

<p>In <em>Personal Mythology</em>, Feinstein and Krippner further explain the personal mythology process: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Many depth psychologists believe that dreams are best understood as an unfolding of the psyche and should not be distorted by intellectual interpretations. In a similar manner, you can learn to sense, without being overly intellectual, the relationship between patterns you find in your dreams and developing personal myths. Dreams serve to mediate between your daily experiences and your underlying myths, Working with your dreams can reveal changes in your mythology that are occurring outside your awareness. Dreams may support or challenge an existing myth ... and you can understand your personal mythology more fully through the instructions [symbols] of your dreams." [3] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I encourage you to examine your own dream material in this light of mythmaking; it is a template for you to observe the smaller and bigger picture of your life as it evolves through developmental stages and reveals the inner and outer journey of the self. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Houses play a major role in shaping our world view. From our earliest memories, houses reflect what our world is and who shares it with us. Housing provides shelter and protection from our environment, safety, physical comfort - a refuge - a place to go within and just be/do and take care of one's needs. It is a space that is special and highly personal and its presence is a dominant and integral image in our daily lives. </p>

<p>The popular story of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> that told about Dorothy's magical journey into her unconscious is an example of the rote that houses have in regard to how our worldviews are perceived. Dorothy 'dreamed' she was being carried through the sky on winds from a Kansas tornado and was awakened abruptly on the edge of the Land of Oz when her house was propelled to earth and dropped with a thud on a wicked witch - and killing her. Dorothy's journey to Oz and all she encountered along the way was all about getting home again - back to her beloved family and familiar surroundings. </p>

<p>Many dream reports I receive have to do with the houses that populate our dreams and what to do with the images. feelings and people related to them. The following is a dream submitted by a woman who inherited her parents' home after their death: </p>

<p><em>"I just realized that a VERY recurring theme in my (usually disturbing) dreams is that ....</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I'm in someone else's house. Most of the time, the houses are cluttered or in disarray.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I know that houses reflect my body - but that I'm "living in someone else's body" doesn't click with me. Any other ideas?"</em> ~A.M. </p>

<p>Yes, one's "dream house" can be one's body if universally interpreted, but beneath that are also personal associations and many other layers of possible meanings. Consider that you are LITERALLY living in someone else's house (your parents') and your recurring dream theme may be pointing out that your innermost being is stiLL dealing with the "clutter or disarray" of memories, feelings and circumstances surrounding your parents. The 'nudging' to go through the houses in your dreams may indicate your psyche's prompting to claim its own identity; in order to have that happen, you may have a desire to have your OWN HOUSE - one that outpictures YOU and not someone's else's tastes, configurations, etc. Also, the house is considered to be the "cosmic center" in religious rites of various cultures, e.g., tepees. huts, Lodges, which may have spiritual significance for you, too, in terms of sacred ancestral connections. </p>

<p>Also, the fact that your dream houses are cluttered, messed up, may mean that you literally have been trying to conform and "live in" someone else's "stuff'. You may sense on many levels a desire to move, clean out and clear out - and you are asking the "dream question" because you already are aware that this would be a healing step for you. Another aspect to consider is that esoterically we have more than one body: astral. causaL physical. etheric. mental spiritual. Make conscious contact with any or aU of these other "selves" and see how they "fit" you; perhaps THEY need some attainment, clearing out or adjustment? </p>

<p>Dorothy's dream search was for her home, but for you, it may be to FIND your true home. It would be important for you to ask yourself such questions as, "What does a house mean to me?"... What are the meanings I attribute to home?'' "What disturbs me about my home?" "What pleases me about it?" "If I could create my perfect house, what would it look like - what would I add - what would I leave out?" "Who would I invite to my home?" "What nourishes me in my home?" By writing out your answers, you may find further clues as to what your dream houses mean for you-and even some surprising answers. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Many of us use dream dictionaries for finding meanings to one-word symbols. One-word symbol meanings can be helpful and fun to use, but there is also danger of taking dream dictionary meanings as absolute. Dream symbol meanings often vary depending on particular situations, and vary greatly from person to person, which is why understanding your own personal meanings for dream symbols is so important to interpreting your own dreams. </p>

<p>An important key in understanding your own dream symbolism and your personal meanings in dreams are what we call “symbol phrases” — learning the meanings of your symbols by examining the context beyond simple one-word objects. To understand the importance of symbol phrases just consider how often we use context in our waking life. Even a simple “Hello” can carry infinite meanings based on the event that precipitates this one-word greeting, the listener’s thoughts and attitudes about the person speaking, and so on. The same is just as true for dreams. </p>

<p>We will tell you more about symbol phrases later, but first a quick background of how we became co-researchers and how Evelyn became so deeply steeped in dreamwork that it led her to the six step Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID™) (1) that she teaches and we research today. </p>

<p>A dream about a “quiet Black man with an unshaven beard” led Evelyn to inquire of Bruce Bynum’s interest in helping research the PMID™ dream interpretation method. Dr. Bynum said yes. We now conduct ongoing projects with students; so you see our research is not limited to the experimental lab. Dreams accommodate to essentially any theory (2) and the PMID ™ dream interpretation method accommodates to essentially any type learning – especially self-facilitation. </p>

<p>Evelyn’s dream about a “many colored ‘dream’ cloth” over her shoulders (prompted by her husband’s question “Wonder if Ev’s dreams could be helpful to her”), gave her confidence to begin intense work with her dreams. In the process, Evelyn developed the PMID™ dream interpretation method. Although she was a highly rated accounting professor at the time, she followed her heart (and her dreams) into earning a counselor education masters degree to support her credibility for teaching dreamwork. Today teaching others how to interpret their own dreams is the “ loveliest and most fulfilling work I have done.” </p>

<p>Now back to explaining what symbol phrases are and how they greatly accelerate your understanding of your dream symbols.</p>

<h2>Awakening Personal Meanings with Symbol Phrases</h2>

<p>We have found the dreamer’s ability to bridge the gap from defining one-word symbols to defining the phrase that contains the symbol is very often a major key to capturing the “unique-to- theindividual meanings.” An example of a one-word symbol is door. One universal meaning of the word, door, is “opportunity.” An example of a symbol phrase is “I lock the car doors,” which one dreamer understood to mean, “I think I have to protect myself from danger without my husband with me ‘on the road of life.’” Another dreamer understood “I closed the door” to mean he had overcome a difficult relationship issue that was represented in his dream. </p>

<p>The phrase that contains the symbol helps the dreamer connect definitions to the context of the dream, the context being pre- dream events, pre-dream thoughts and experiences with people, places and objects. Selecting key symbol phrases is a judgment evaluation by the dreamer as to which dream phrases are the most personally meaningful. Dreamers’ spontaneous feelings are the best gages for knowing the relative accuracy of meanings she or he has developed. </p>

<p>Next are examples of symbol phrases that dreamers selected from their dreams. For purposes of these examples, we added words to the definitions to show dreamers’ connections to the context of their dreams. </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<p>“Decide to be friendly with person:” Way to overcome trace of stressful emotions about the person in this dream is to think friendly thoughts about her. (She was also implicated in a dream that I revisited last night.) </p>

<p>“Did not spend time with my friend Sara Emerson:” Reprimands me for skipping meditation yesterday after I decided my uninterrupted work was more important.

<p>“Does not want to hear what I have to say:” Be cautious about reminiscing in remorseful ways. In the dream, a childhood friend thinks I am going to talk about activities that she might have been involved in. Last night I almost went into talking remorsefully about this friend. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/">YourGuidingDreams.com</a> offers our <a href="http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/public/dreamscan.htm">DreamScan™</a> (latest technology to instantly finding meanings to one-word symbols), for use as “thought-starters.’ DreamScan™, free to visitors on the site, is fun to use, and many of those meanings reflect the context of the dream.. HOWEVER, the best way to find “unique-to-the-individual” meanings is to go beyond one-word symbols to defining symbol phrases. YourGuidingDreams.com gives instructions to members for defining symbol phrases. The Dreamwork Systems Perspective PMID™ step 6 uses a dreamwork systems approach to understanding dreams about relationships. A dreamwork systems approach is mindful of family systemic models, except, instead of the family or other major relationships coming together in personal counseling sessions, an individual studies series of dreams about various major relationships, primarily the family. (See the PMID™ steps in the box).</p>

<h2>Personalized Method for Interpretation Dreams (PMID™) Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your dream contents to current events and circumstances (most often, same day) to determine the context or theme of your dream. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your pre-dream thoughts (most often, same day) to your dream contents by treating the dream as a responsive answer to your pre-dream thoughts. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Develop your personal experienced-based definitions of dream symbol/symbol phrase meanings (or associations about) each dream character, place, object or circumstance. </p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Explore the emotions you felt during your dream. Compare to your waking emotions. Also, periodically compare to previous dreams for changes in emotions over time about a relationship or issue being studied. </p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Explore dream for possible suggestions of how to change thoughts, attitudes or behavior leading to understanding and reduction of key issues. </p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Who is the primary relationship in this dream? Comment on your dreaming reactions to/ relationship with any person(s) in this dream. Also, comment on whether this dream reflects current effects from past or recent experiences with another or others. If so, compare how you related/reacted in the past with your current reactions in similar circumstances. </p>

<p>To demonstrate the dreamwork systems perspective, we present a synopsis of Katharine’s series of dreams. After each of the first four dreams and interpretations, Evelyn gave feedback (through the instructor-facilitated university course) on Katharine’s PMID method use. Katharine interpreted her remaining dreams without facilitation. </p>

<p>To set the background for the primary relationship issues Katharine faced, we take a couple sentences from Katharine’s first dreamwork. “I have recurrent emotions of guilt and responsibility. I often feel like I need to keep everyone happy and not cause conflict, and that I must take on other people’s views on certain things.” Then, well into her work with dreams, Katharine wrote, “A common thread (in my dreams) seems to be that I am not responsible for other people’s feelings and I cannot carry that burden of feeling like I need to make people feel a certain way.” Dream series follows: </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream One: “Family Crash.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Katharine is driving, the whole family is in the car, she loses control and the car crashes. The night before the dream, Katherine felt guilty for letting her family down because she could not go with them to a football game.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Two: “Victorian Mansion.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Victorian vs. present day,” could symbolize being out of place… me caretaking my mom… which is out of place.” On one floor are children who “died at about age four.” “I can remember at a very young age, about four, being left at daycare, and being so upset that my mom was leaving, and wanting to cry, but not letting myself, because I knew that would make it hard for her to leave.” The night before this dream, Katharine worried about her mom’s “too quiet” attitude.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div> 

<h3>Dream Three: “Blocked Path.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Katharine is the only family member brave enough to leave the house to make a delivery to a neighbor.. Dead animals in her path (“possibly any negative emotions/ situations my family is unwilling to deal with”) prevent her from getting back to the family. The family watches with “we told you so” looks on their faces. “I feel guilty… and very alone… and scared.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Four: “Bullets.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A roommate is shot. Katharine tries to stop the bleeding. The night before the dream, Katherine tried to stand up for a roommate who did not defend herself.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Five: “Going Back to High School”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A breakthrough dream. <em>Katharine gathers courage to give a dead cat back to a high school boyfriend after he leaves the dead cat in her locker. “As I walk back down the hall, I feel very relieved and freed.” The night before the dream the friend, now several years past high school, “pouted” when she declined a date with him, as he did during high school days. “I need to put Marshall’s childish behavior back on him and… refuse to carry around that worry.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div> 

<h3>Dream Six: “Painting in the Basement”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>-came one night after Katharine, for the first time, told a long-time friend, Paige, that she disapproved of Paige’s treatment of a young man. In the dream, <em>Katharine invites Paige to “paint in the basement.” Paige resists. “Me eventually going back upstairs:” “Represents me (Katharine) realizing I can’t force Paige to look deeper into herself….”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Seven: “Nobody Believes Me”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a dream she had before the course, but was “too freaked out” to work with it, came again during the course). <em>Katharine first watches a sister bury a dead person in the back yard. Finally, Katharine comes out from “ Hiding behind a bush: My own fear of not knowing how to confront my sister” and “Stands next to my sister: This represents me confronting my sister, but also supporting her with this problem.” Before the dream, Katharine asked her parents to talk with this daughter about a disorder that seemed quite plain to Katharine. “They didn’t believe me.”</em> (They don’t believe her in the dream either.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>(Dreamer’s Summary):</strong> “Common with other dreams is the focus on me expressing myself more even if it is scary because I am not used to it. In “Family Crash,” I am in the driver’s seat, and in the “Blocked Path” dream, I am the one to be brave, and in “Nobody Believes Me,” I am the one to take charge and go stand by my sister. This message is very clear to me that I have the power to change things that I don’t like, even if I may not necessarily change how others respond. I can change my own actions, which does affect the system.” </p>

<p>A major aim for the PMID™ method is to help people in the current generation make healthful differences in their own lives, thus terminating potential unhealthful patterns. For several years, coauthor E. Bruce Bynum has suggested a “personalized” view of an extended familial system. In his explorations of dreams with individuals and with families in therapy, he has found people in close association, such as the family, resonate with each other in such a way that dreams of each family member express the family’s emotional situations. This shared matrix that exists within and between us, interlaces us all in an enfolding field, in a Family Unconscious. Though dreams of each family member reflect the family constellation, individual’s dreams differ, depending on the individual’s particular skew or perception of the family constellation and conflicts (4, 5). </p>

<p>Though we concentrate on relationship dreams, the PMID™ Method is equally useful for “everyday” guidance in common activities, such as home, work, recreation, career, education, and health. Simply eliminate PMID™ Step 6. Examples of what we call everyday dreams are the <a href="../bcpov6zprofe">two dreams published by Dream Network</a> (6).</p>

<p>It always fascinates me to hear other people’s stories about their work with dreams and Bobbie’s is no exception. <em>Notes from a Dreamer…on Dreaming</em> is a personal journey in dream interpretation towards self discovery and healing through dreamwork. </p>

<p>Like many people, Bobbie has been in a process of self discovery for much of her life. Yet through all her years of personal development, there was something else that kept making itself known to her through her dreams, something that called for her attention which ultimately catapulted her into a deeper exploration of her own unconscious. </p>

<p><em>Notes from a Dreamer…on Dreaming</em> reads like you’re having a very comfortable conversation with Bobbie about dreams and that personal feel makes for a very enjoyable and enlightening read. Bobbie uses many of her own dreams as examples to document her journey towards healing and also to share her style of dream interpretation giving the reader the sense that anyone can learn to interpret their own dreams.</p>

<p>Throughout her book, Bobbie shares many useful tips in working with your dreams, including things like dream recall techniques, keeping a dream journal, the creative influence in dreams, how to work with symbols, archetypes, people, colors, and how to take action on behalf of a dream. The book is decorated with Bobbie’s personal artwork and poetry making it visually engaging as well as engaging. She also shares many dream resources that readers can immediately access to get involved with by listing websites dedicated to the study of dreams.</p>

<p>Bobbie also includes a Symbol Dictionary with 76 common dream symbols to be used as a catalyst to get the reader started in working with their own imagery though not to be used as actual interpretations.</p>

<p>I deeply appreciated Bobbie’s passionate encouragement to readers to get to know their own dreams and imagery. Bobbie’s love of the dreamtime is apparent in every chapter of her book as she continually honors dreams for much of her personal growth and healing which may not have otherwise been accessed in the profound way that only dreams can provide.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>In my work as an accounting professor I am catching fascinating glimpses of an ever-present Counselor who has finally caught my attention by speaking to me in my dreams. </p>

<p>Imagine my delight at discovering that my "theater of the night" also acts as a "light by day" as I teach university students. I have included two dreams in which I used that "light." </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-1.jpg" alt="Assignment dreams" width="300px" height="auto"></p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT of the DREAMS &amp; the DREAMER:</h2>

<p>My students tell me I require more work than most professors, but the most often repeated comment on student evaluations, is that I care about my students; I act as sort of "mom" role for them. Yet another role I assume is "coach". I use "coaching" language and techniques. Not surprisingly, one of the dreams included in this article reflects the coach role as well as the role of a mom. Quieting to me, though, is the clear message in both dreams, to me, to ease off - to stand back.</p>

<h2>SETTING OF THE FIRST DREAM:</h2>

<p>I assigned an ethics case for my principles of accounting classes. The case involved a graduating senior who had job interviews at two separate companies in the same city. Upon discovering he would be reimbursed for interviewing expenses, the student billed both companies for the <em>full</em> amount of his expenses. </p>

<p>In our brief class discussion, a couple students openly said they would have done the same thing; that is, take double reimbursement. However, later when I read the students' written responses to the ethics question, I was surprised to find the same comment made by <em>several</em> other students. I gave considerable thought of what to say to the classes for our next meeting. I finally had my talk prepared on how it is very important to be honest in coming to know oneself and so I appreciated the honesty in the responses. I planned then to lead into a discussion of the matter of treating others as one would like to be treated. I thought my plan was set. Then the following dream came in the early morning the day I planned to give my "little talk".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Don't Ask Your Students to Wash Their Dirty Laundry in Public</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><em>People are washing clothes in a laundry area of our apartment building. They brought the clothes up from the basement. I bring my clothes to wash also. A woman who was washing in the basement is now washing upstairs in this laundromat sort of area. A young man, probably a college student, is standing close to her and when he sees me, he says very loudly and possessively to me, "I'm next". I take my basket of clothes downstairs and talk very loud in mimic of the young man's "I'm next" as I go down the stairs. But when I get to the basement, I understand why these people aren't washing in the basement - either there aren't machines here now, or they aren't working. The upstairs is more like a laundromat, than the basement.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>[Oh, the 'washing your dirty clothes in public' dream is saying not to say anything about the students' ethics case answers in class. Several students said they would take the "double" reimbursement for interviewing trip.]</strong> (The bold type indicates the "aha" point which came just as I finished typing the dream.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The dream is saying my planned talk on the ethics case in class is like asking my students to "wash their dirty laundry in public." (Laundromat - a public place.) The matter is a personal matter and best handled at the subconscious level (the basement). Discussing the matter further in class is like asking my students to reveal in public what each can only decide for themselves. (Clothes are often symbolic of the personality.) </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-0.jpg" alt="clothing in public" width="400px" height="auto"></p>

<p>Assigning the ethics case provided an opportunity for each student to cleanse personality attitudes and emotions in the privacy of their subconscious level. However, my "appraisal" of the students responses would cause the students to bring their "cleansing work" to the mental level in defense of their attitudes and render the "washing machines in the basement" (use of subconscious mind) inoperable for improving understanding and cleansing attitudes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the dream seems to confirm what I had already said in class the day the case was assigned: We must live in consideration for others. Likely, the setting of the dream, in an apartment complex (several people involved), confirms the need for consideration of others. Likewise, the young man student who loudly and possess-ively tells me "I'm next" confirms his lack of consideration for others while watching out intensely for his own interests. </p>

<p>Notice, too, my own mimic of the student's "I'm next," which seems to point out by <strong>exaggeration</strong> that for me to <strong>repeat</strong> the students' comments about accepting the double reimbursement is certainly an unprofessional and unproductive method of dealing with the situation. Apparently my "dream counselor" is saying my "wellplanned" little talk would be a taunting insult to my students. </p>

<p>I believe the dream is further saying my planned talk wasn't from the my inner resources. (When I arrive in the basement - subconscious level - the washing machines are either not there or are inoperable.) Even though I gave the matter considerable thought I still didn't feel completely satisfied with what I planned to say. And, finally, notice I was also planning to wash my dirty clothes. </p>

<p>How I used my dream: When I went to class the day of the dream, I gave each student their copy of the textbook authors' comments on the ethics case and made a note to myself to assign the ethics cases from most of the chapters we will cover. But I did NOT give my planned "little talk."</p>

<h2>SETTING of the SECOND DREAM:</h2>

<p>I use a <em>team</em> approach in teaching an advanced auditing class where the class size ranges between twelve to fifteen students. We sit around oblong tables pulled together and act as an auditing team with me, the professor, as the partner-in-charge. This spring I purposely used only one table in order to bring the students in close eye-to-eye contact. </p>

<p>One of the hardest working students in the class was also the star of the university men's basketball team. The dream came in early morning the day there was major auditing case work due as well as an important basketball game that night. </p>

<p>About "gymnastics:" My husband often uses the word "gymnastics" in referring to frustration from excessive paperwork. </p>

<h2>THE GYMNASTICS AUDIT TEAM &amp; the COACH-MOM</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am an observer. There is a coach and young athletes - perhaps nine or ten. The coach is at the head of two parallel bars on which the young athletes are doing training. It seems like they are turning over the bars. The bars are two rows close together and the athletes are boys and girls. They are probably the same age, but the girls look more mature. At first I only notice the boys and one in particular. He is tired and thinks the coach is expecting too much. The boy says he has some injury and crawls between the bars toward the lady coach. She doesn't stop the practice, but keeps on going. The boy now does half-hearted turning over the bars. Now it is the end of the day's session and <strong>the boy quits the team!</strong> And now others quit the team and there are only six girls left; they don't complain. They seem to be willing to work. The coach is discouraged though. I believe she is wondering if there will be enough participants on the team for the next competition (but the dream is unclear on that point).</em></p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Now I seem like the coach</strong> and am standing just inside the door at the house of the boy who quit first. It is dusk-like in this modest room. The boy's mother is in the room. She is very discouraged about the boy quitting. She is very disappointed. She had high hopes of how well things were going. She knew he had something to overcome -fight back from something- but had thought her son was making progress.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The parallel bars, so close together, is the setting for the auditing class. The arrangement of the young women and young men was basically the same as in the classroom with the young wo men on one side and the young men on the other side with the coach at the front end. </p>

<p>For the young athlete-scholar, the intense practice <strong>was</strong> his style except when the <em>"gymnastics" (unnecessary "paper work")</em> required of him as a student, coupled with the demands placed on him as an superior athlete, took more strength than he physically possessed. In the dream his "injury" portrays this. His crawling toward the coach shows his desperate need for relief. </p>

<p>The young man's mother (the mom in the professor) is concerned about him in a more compassionate and understanding way than the coach who has a greater interest in the team's being able to do well against competition than in the physical, emotional or mental well being of the gymnast-students. </p>

<p><strong><em>How I used the dream:</em></strong> I immediately cut back on the work assignments for the auditing class.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Henry Reed</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How did you first get interested in dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Henry Reed:</strong> I recorded my first dream in 1968, when I was a graduate student at UCLA. A student friend had inspired me with the dreams he shared with me. His dreams were different than what I was learning about in school. In my psychology classes dreams were seen primarily as medical samples to be used by professionals for the purpose of diagnosis. But my friend was having dreams that he used himself for inspiration and guiding his life. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Didn't you teach dreams in a university setting yourself?</p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Yes, in 1970, I began as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. I saw the possibility of combining dream research with a human potentials vision.My first dream project concerned a humanistically designed experiment to improve dream recall. The students and I explored what happens when people try to improve their memory for dreams. No one had ever tried that before, especially with a humanistic approach involving full disclosure and collaboration with the students, who were the participants in the study. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What did you learn about improving dream recall? Anything we can share with our readers? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> You can learn the ropes but not use them if you're not motivated to do so. We discovered that there is both a skill factor and an effort factor in dream recall. People can develop dream recall skills, such as lying still in the morning and writing down whatever comes to mind. But lacking proper motivation they won't spend much time using those skills. We published in 1974 our study in the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em>, showing that given special incentives people can demonstrate dream recall skills they had learned. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Did you do any work on dream interpretation in the university at that time? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> About the time I began teaching at Princeton, Fritz Perls was doing dream symbol dialogues at Esalen. His work would ultimately open up dream interpretation technology to the masses because he was the first person to practice a specific dream interpretation technique in public for all to see. We could experiment with his method and learn from it.</p>

<p>In my course on Carl Jung, for example, we married Fritz Perls' dialogue method to Jung's symbol amplification perspective. We would interview a dream symbol to learn its meaning.</p>

<p>Gayle Delaney, by the way, who has since become well known for her dream books, was a student in that class. She developed her "Dream Symbol Definition" method from our work in that course on Jung.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I know you spent some time at the Jung Institute in Zurich. How did that affect your work with dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It's hard to say. When I went to the C.G. Jung Dream Laboratory in Zurich, during a sabbatical from Princeton, I went there to work with Carl Meier, who had written about Asklepios, the Greek god of healing in dreams. But I was surprised at the mechanical approach he took to dreams in that lab. He had people sleep in a cold room to see if they would have more active dreams to warm the body. He had no conception of a humanistic approach to research. I wanted to help people incubate healing dreams. He was against it, so I came home and did it on my own. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How did you do that? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> My dreams initiated me into recovery from alcoholism, so I had some personal experience about how they worked in that way (the story of this healing appears in my book, Getting Help from Dreams). I had also had a series of dreams that provided some of the details that I used to develop a dream incubation ritual. I wanted to do this work in a setting outside the laboratory and I got myself invited to the Edgar Cayce summer camp, where dreamwork was a regular part of the activities. I created a "dream tent" for people to sleep in. I asked them to decorate the tent with their dreams and I helped them to prepare for a special dream. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zreedi-1.jpg" alt="Dream Tent" /></p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Did it work? Did people have special dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Did they ever! They had past life dreams, out of body dreams, things that I had never experienced myself. I was in awe of what was happening. Frankly, it was over my head. I was not spiritually awakened enough, or mature enough, to deal with what was going on. </p>

<p>I wrote an article about the work up to that date, and the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em> accepted it, in 1974, without any changes! That was flattering. But what I wrote enraged the faculty at Princeton. They terminated my contract, which was an unusual move, and caused some dissension in the department. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What got them so upset? They didn't like dream study? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It wasn't the content that upset them, it was my experimental method. I wrote in that article that if you wanted to obtain such dreams in psychology experiments, you couldn't conceive of dreams as being the result of a mechanical process. I proposed that we need to view dreams as an element in a storyline, involving an autonomous, transpersonal awareness, and that the best way to provide a context to develop that story line was using a symbolic ritual, not a mechanical technique. The folks at Princeton took that to mean that I was subverting the scientific process.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That must have been frustrating for you, especially if the Journal of Humanistic Psychology had been so enthusiastic about your paper to have published it unedited. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, I was terribly hurt, yes. But also, I felt overwhelmed by what was coming out of the dream tent, so I wanted to stop it anyway, until I could grow into it. That was back in the period of 1974-1976, and there wasn't the same climate of understanding and support as we have today for that kind of alternative reality. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Well, I'm sure the dream tent would be popular today. It suggests that dreams are a doorway to all the alternative consciousness manifestations people explore these days. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I felt that I helped open up a hole to the heavens, so to speak, so that divine energy could manifest in dreams once again. I was pleased when, in 1983, A psychiatrist named P. Richard Gunther, published an article in the American Journal of Psychotherapy, "Religious Dreaming: A viewpoint," in which he credited my dream incubation work with demonstrating that God was alive and well in dreams. But at the time--this was around 1974--I backed off that intense shamanistic relationship with people, and took more of a coach-like attitude. I let people create their own sacred space, create their own dream tent substitute at home--the personal dream diary. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You continued to research dream incubation, but in a different way? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Yes, exactly. The Edgar Cayce Foundation commissioned me to create a home-study research project on dreams. I was excited by the idea for two reasons. One, I got to develop the approach of conducting research with people in a humanistic manner by having them work on self-help projects at home. That approach has proven very effective, and in the years since, many others have adopted this synergistic approach to awakening consciousness through research. Also, I was interested in exploring Edgar Cayce's basic hypothesis about dream interpretation. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That sounds intriguing. What did he say about dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It's not so much what he said about dreams, but about how to learn to interpret them. His basic idea was that it is easier to learn to interpret dreams if you have a reason to use them for something constructive. If you try to apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life, he proposed that dreams would respond to your efforts and help you learn to interpret them.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That sounds like the dreams would be active from their end to meet you half way if you would get off your duff and do something about your dream interpretation instead of just thinking about it. Is that the idea? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. Hugh Lynn Cayce, Edgar Cayce's son, is quoted as saying, "The best interpretation of a dream is one you apply." Just as Montague Ullman developed safeguards so lay people could work together on their dreams, so Edgar Cayce had proposed a safeguard for individual dream work. It was testing a dream interpretation through application. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> So how did you implement that philosophy into your home study research project? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I created a "Dream Quest" workbook. It took the idea of the dream tent and spread it out over four weeks, with a weekly cycle of dream work. The adventure began by a person gathering dreams for a week while thinking about various areas of life that could be improved. Then I created some dream interpretation exercises that helped the person collaborate with their dreams to choose a project to work on, such as having more fun with the children, or getting along better with the boss, or improving personal morale. The exercise helped them to develop a strategy based upon their dream interpretations, then try it out for a week while recording more dreams. The second week's dream interpretation work focused on getting feedback from their dreams on the use of their strategy. From that work, they developed a revised strategy, and so on, continuing to look to dreams for new insights to apply and then getting feedback from the dreams about that application. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It sounds like it created the possibility for a relationship to dreams that would make for an ongoing drama. Did it work? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It sure did! At least for those who saw it through to the finish. There was a discipline involved. About one-third of the approximately 2000 people we enrolled finished the project. Most of them had very positive stories to tell. The dream interpretation exercises worked to provide applicable insights. Many people told about how they had made significant progress on their personal issues. I was very pleased. I published in 1978 a report on this work in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. It was the first study of its kind to demonstrate that it is possible for lay people, working on their own at home, to make constructive use of their dreams to improve their lives. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> The average person isn't sure that they can deal with their dreams, so your results seem pretty important for them to know about. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, yes, but even more important back then was what that study meant for the dreamwork movement itself. Prior to that, the usual comment from professionals, like psychologists and psychiatrists, was that it's best not to encourage people to look at their dreams because they are liable to stir up problems for themselves. Professionals are not so likely to say that today, and that's the result of changes brought about by the dreamwork movement. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I read somewhere you being called the "father" of the dreamwork movement. How did you get that title? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I don't think that I really have that title, but it comes from a passage in a book by Jack McGuire, one of the early participants in the Dream Network Bulletin. In his book on dreams, Night and Day, Jack describes my work creating the Sundance: The Community Dream Journal, and how it led to DNB. If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement--and actually there were many parents--it comes from the power of the press. The very existence of the Sundance journals, regardless of the content within them, spoke loudly about the birth of a movement. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Tell me about the Sundance journals. We've heard of them referred to often, but have never seen one. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, I guess they are collector's items among historically minded dream workers. It grew out of that home study project. People wanted more. I saw that people had stories to tell about how they had used their dreams. I had a series of dreams, a couple involving the word "Sundance" and related archetypal imagery involving the theme of "The Many and the One," suggesting that we could create a UNI-versity of dream students, sharing their explorations into dreams. So I created the journal just for that purpose. Before professional dreamworkers had any kind of forum for scientific exchange, the Sundance journals provided DREAMERS with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, to create a body of knowledge and expertise about dreamwork. The publication acknowledged that ordinary people can have a personal relationship with dreams and learn from one another's experiences. It is the equivalent of the public, scientific enterprise, but on a popular level. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Wow, I can see how that would help launch a movement, because it would empower people. The press has a lot of power to give the people a voice. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. And Sundance gave people a voice about dreams as being more than just a medical sample. Most of the things that professional dreamworkers explore today were first mentioned by ordinary dreamers in the Sundance journals. There were six issues, published from 1976-1978. They were subsidized by Atlantic University. When funding ran out, Bill Stimson, who was big fan, started up Dream Network Bulletin to carry the torch, the same torch you are carrying today. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Well, you carried the torch yourself, I know, because you were an editor of DNB for a couple of years, with Bob Van de Castle, an enthusiast of dream telepathy. Didn't you develop some kind of dream telepathy experiment that emphasized community dreaming? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I did, and it probably is one of my dreamwork inventions that is going the strongest today. We call it the "dream helper ceremony." </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> We published an article or two about that ceremony in DNB. Tell us about it. How did it come about? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It was a serendipitous finding. When I had the dream tent up at camp, I noticed that often the kids in the camp would dream about the person sleeping in the tent. Sometimes it wouldn't be obvious to anyone but me, who knew about what the person in the tent was dealing with, so I could recognize the themes in the other kids' dreams. It seemed to me that here was a case of spontaneous dream ESP that was occurring on a regular basis, a rare bird in the ESP literature. I wanted to see if I could create an intentional experiment that would bring about the same results. I had had a dream of my own about the power of a circle of dreamers to guide me. I also worked with Bob Van de Castle because of his experience with dream telepathy, and together we created what we called the Dream Helper Ceremony. That's how it came about. To describe it, what you have in this ceremony, is that a group of people promise to dream about the undisclosed problem of a someone in distress. It's almost like a group of Good Samaritans, who offer help to a stranger in distress. Over a period of some twenty five years, myself and many other people who have tried this experiment have found it very successful. It's fitting, I suppose, that DNB has published accounts of it, but when Van de Castle and I submitted an article to the journal Dreaming, which is very concerned with its academic standing, they wouldn't publish it. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Why not? What are the results that are so controversial?</p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, the experiment began as a humanistic alternative to standard ESP experiments, so it has this parapsychological background. But the dream helper ceremony also stands on its own as a community dream process. Basically, what happens is this: No one dream usually seems very pertinent. But the group finds patterns in the dreams that enables them, usually, to correctly diagnose the person's problem, even though they never knew what it was until the experiment was over. Mark Thurston, who is now an Executive Director of the A.R.E., got his doctorate at Humanistic Psychology Institute, under Stanley Krippner, for his scientific study of that one finding in the dream helper ceremony. Some people will accept, and some people will not, that kind of evidence for ESP. But what I find more interesting is the more transpersonal dimension to the group dreaming process. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by transpersonal? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It means finding something transcending the personal within the personal itself. In the dream helper ceremony, what we find is that the pattern of imagery in the dreams points the person's problem, but doesn't really provide any help to that person. The purpose of the ceremony is to help the person, remember, so we need to go farther. People question whether you can really dream for someone else, or if dreams have any external, objective value. Well, the answer we get is that if people will interpret their dreams for what they are learning about themselves, then their insights really do contain helpful advice for the person they were dreaming for. It is as if each person in the dream helper circle telepathically tuned in on the person's issue, saw it in terms of their own issues, and their dreams responded to the resonance by suggesting how the dreamer should work on his or her own related problem. That is the transpersonal element--each person found the distressed stranger within themselves. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That seems to be a theme in dream groups. As in Montague Ullman's dream process, where each member of the group can relate personally to the dreamer's dream. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. And in the Dream Helper Ceremony we have an alternative to the Ullman group method, not better and not a substitute, but an alternative way to have a group of lay people, even strangers to one another, work together constructively with their dreams. Today, many people who have experienced the dream helper ceremony go on to share it with others because of its power, even for the uninitiated. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by uninitiated? People who don't believe in dream telepathy? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I mean that you can take a group of people who have no prior dream experience, and, without trying to persuade them of any assertions about the value of dreams, the meaning of dreams, or anything other assertion about dreams, you can let them see for themselves. All you ask of them is this: Are you willing to keep a promise? Are you willing to lend a hand to someone here in our group who is confronting a life challenge and asks for your help? If so, then get a volunteer in the group, who doesn't say what their problem is, and have the people in the group promise to remember a dream for that person that night. That's all. I've done this experiment with Elderhostels, where you have senior citizens who haven't remembered a dream for ages. They can relate to the premise of the experiment. They doubt their ability to remember dreams, but remember them they do, because they've made a commitment. They don't think their dreams amount to much, but when I ask them to examine them in their group for common themes and come up with a diagnosis of the person's problem they were dreaming for, they do it and they surprise themselves at how accurate they are! They see that their dreams have value, that they contain helpful information. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It seems incredible that people can actually direct their dream to an invisible target. How do you think they do that? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> That's a good question, and has sent me off onto a new research direction. Several years ago I gave an invited address about the Dream Helper Ceremony to the annual convention of the Association for the Study of Dreams. Bob Van de Castle and I had conducted several workshop demonstrations of it at prior conventions, and now they wanted to hear from me about how it worked. As I was explaining in my talk, research psychologists have developed several high powered technologies to influence dream content in the laboratory--hypnosis, pre-sleep suggestion, sensory bombardment, and so on. It only works to a limited degree. Dreams seem to have a will of their own. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I think that's an important point. What makes dreams so valuable is that they have a mind of their own. They aren't just little stories that we crank out. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. What I realized while I was up on the podium giving that talk, explaining this history of dream research, was that in the years that I had conducted Dream Helper Ceremonies, none of the participants had ever asked me, "how am I supposed to dream about someone else's problem, much less when I don't know even what it is?" It seems like such an obvious question, but no one had ever asked it. And, I realized, if they had asked it, I wouldn't have known how to tell them. It was like a mind-blowing light exploding in my head--we had never given them any instructions on how to do it, we never used a single technique. I realized that it was their intention to do so that carried the day. They simply did it intuitively. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Dreams are pretty intuitive. We don't usually think of that fact, but they are one of are greatest living proofs that we are all intuitive. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> You're reading my mind. That's exactly the insight that came to me spontaneously while I was giving that talk. Afterwards, I decided to investigate how this intuitive communication between people in the Dream Helper Ceremony operated. It led me to the discovery of what I call the "Intuitive Heart." It relates to the idea that when we care about someone, our heart "goes out" to that person. In other words, we form an intuitive, empathic connection. The secret of dreaming, I believe, is that it is an empathic process. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It seems so obvious when you say it like that, that dreams are a form of empathy. Does that affect how we should see dreams, or interpret them? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I think so. Rather than seeing dreams as containing hidden messages, see dreams as experiences of empathy. Then use empathy with the dream to reconnect with the experience of dreaming itself. I've been researching this process using a form of intuitive dream interpretation. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by "intuitive" dream interpretation? Doesn't all forms of dream interpretation employ intuition? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> In what you might call "analytic" dream interpretation, we look at the story line of the dream, or patterns, or symbols, or feelings. In other words, we begin by analyzing some feature of the dream by a standardized process to get a handle on the dream's meaning. In intuitive dream interpretation, we are looking for an immediate, holistic response to the dream. In the Bible, Joseph interpreted dreams and called it a gift from God. That suggests an intuitive response, direct from the unconscious. To explore this type of ability, I've tried having people get into a meditative state and hear the dream. Another approach is to read a dream to someone who is hypnotized. A really fun way to do it is to have people dance themselves dizzy, then respond to a dream--that works surprisingly well. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I guess you help people get out of their minds, and then dream interpretation comes easier. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> A dream occurs in a special state of consciousness and is the best expression of itself. So what state of consciousness do we need to be in, in order to be able to directly appreciate the dream? That is the quest of intuitive dream interpretation. </p>

<p>Most recently, I've explored something akin to dream divination as an approach to dream interpretation. Tarot readers, for example, will throw down cards and interpret a dream before they even know what it is. There's a big synchronicity element there, which of course pertains to intuition. The Mayans also do something similar, using a calendar divination to interpret your dream, again, before they even know what the dream is. These methods have something in common with the Dream Helper Ceremony, because in all cases, someone tries to help someone else by forming an intuitive empathy with that person's issue. So I created an experimental procedure I call Intuitive Heart™ Dream Story method. It goes like this: </p>

<p>Person A makes an intuitive heart connection with person B, who has a dream in mind. Person A allows a personal memory to spontaneously emerge in consciousness. Person A tells person B the story of that memory. Person A then begins to reflect upon that story as a teaching story: what does Person A have to learn from that story, what lesson does it contain. Afterwards, person B tells the dream and makes the connection with the story. The structure of this process grows directly out of the Dream Helper Ceremony. One person goes inside to get something personal, makes a lesson from it, and that lesson also feeds the other person. What makes it more interesting is that a dream itself is a story. A dream interpretation is a story about a story, and it is interesting to see how one person's personal story opens up another person's relationship to a dream. Here again we are seeing the community building aspect of dreams.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You are like a walking dream encyclopedia, Henry! I admire the creativity and spirituality that you have evolved and introduced into scientific circles as well as among every night dreamers. I'd like to tell a brief story. When I first started stewarding Dream Network Journal, one day I stood with hands on hips staring at a huge pile of 'nuts and bolts' work that needed attending. I was feeling a little disenchanted -- like the individual who achieves enlightenment and/or experiences nirvana and is then told to 'chop wood and carry water.' Just then, I heard, from behind my left shoulder, a chorus singing a phrase from one of Paul Winter's albums: "And great is your reward in Heaven!" That's all it took to energize me for the work at hand and it has sustained me ever since! I sing it now to you. Can we look at the dream story from a broader perspective? Hopefully, you can weave a response around this series of related questions: What impact do you perceive the Dream movement is having, culturally.... especially in Western culture? Are we, in fact, helping to raise consciousness, to bring about the changes that are so evidently needed? What changes have you perceived over the past 30 years? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I think the study of dreams introduces the transpersonal into the culture. Dreams have always expanded our understanding of reality by challenging our boundaries of the real, of the possible. One of the ways dream study impacts the culture, especially as we hear one another's dreams, is that we are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams. We hear our inner, subjective response to the outer world. That helps spiritualize our lives, which means in this context, to fight against the idea that we are just machines, that the universe is a mechanical process. Our dreams show us, and do so especially when dreamwork allows the people to hear one another's dreams, that we are spirit and are alive and well and paying attention. </p>

<p>The change I have seen, is that people are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another's dreams. It used to be that if you told a dream in public, someone had to make a joke to relieve the tension introduced by that alternative reality. The dreamwork movement has been helping to socialize people to respond in a more constructive way to hearing a dream. That ability to listen and respond to a dream in an accepting, open, way creates a path for the dream consciousness to enter our culture in a more significant manner.</p>

<p>The first time I encountered the work of Henry Reed I was immediately impressed. That was many years ago and I have been awaiting the time when he would again publish another book on his dreamwork. Now, that time has come. Henry’s new book, <em>Dream Medicine</em>, an expansion of his earlier book <em>Getting Help From Your Dreams</em> (1985), is a very interesting journey through his introduction and research into dreamwork in the 1960’s, at the beginning of what has been called the dream movement. In detail, Henry describes how his interest in dreams began and how they moved him forward into areas of dreamwork that had not yet been explored. Paying mindful attention not only his own dreams, but the dreams of others, Henry has established new ways to work with dreams which have enhanced the work and taken it to even deeper levels. What impressed me about <em>Dream Medicine</em> is the way in which Henry’s passion for the work has motivated new and innovative ways to work with dreams, not only for ourselves, but also for others.</p>

<p>This is not a book about dream interpretation, it is a book that encourages the dreamer to honor their dreams by being in a very different relationship to and with the images. Many chapters are devoted to a variety of ways in which to work with dreams, so, depending on what kind of involvement you find most appealing, you are sure to find new ways of working with your own dreams by using any one, or many, of these methods. I found the book to be insightful, fun, and easy to read, and although there is some repetition, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Henry adds a very personal touch to his book by adding in his own artwork to the pages which is a delightful way of continuing to add to the dimension of the dreamtime.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The Mastery of Love, first published January 1st 1999, 240 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Based on the Toltec tradition of the guidance of the fundamental three masteries, Don Miguel Ruiz guides us through the third of these which is the Mastery of Love. If we can master love, we master life itself. One anonymous reviewer on Amazon.com called this book “a courageous exploration of what it takes to experience being human in all its fullness,” and I completely agree. It cuts to the chase with simple easy language and clear and concise reasoning. This is not so much a book about dreams as it is a book about self love. </p>

<p>If you are not well versed in the notions of boundaries, projections and expectations, personal accountability, core shame and family of origin issues, and you’d rather not spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in therapy unraveling it all, then this easy to comprehend audio CD is a delightful alternative. It will show you how impossible it is to find love in another when you are unable to locate it internally. You come to understand how you began as a perfect being and how your emotional life developed from that point of perfection. It quickly becomes obvious that there is a choice to follow a path of suffering and pain in an endless, recurring cycle (the dream of hell), or to make a conscious choice to break that cycle, master the dream and live in happiness. The how and why of broken hopes and relationships, the simplicity of cause and effect become instantly clear with a first listening of the audio book, and somehow even more so with repeated play.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zssong-0.jpg" width="300" height="auto" alt="Bambi Corso"/></p>

<p>I have always been a lover of dreams, and I have always known that working with them would guide me throughout my life. At a young age, dreams became vital for my well being.  There was something about them that fed me, something that deep inside I knew was absolutely necessary for my own development and evolution. Thus, dreams became a practice in commitment, mindfulness, and trust.</p>

<p>As a child, there were three things that I was profoundly interested in. One of them was doctoring, and the others were reading and writing. In those days, I was fascinated with medicine, the idea of which was initiated by my mother who practiced holistic medicine and the power of the mind so we could heal ourselves. I was a very quiet child, so reading and writing were ideal forms of communication and therefore became my other big interests.</p>

<p>In my late teens, and far from the memories of my childhood interests, I began a 27-year career in the corporate world of administration and later executive management. Though this type of livelihood was stable and I learned a tremendous amount about business, it was unfulfilling and devoid of passion. I watched my dreams carefully as they pointed to high levels of creativity, meaning, soul and purpose. These dreams seemed to keep me going and kept me hopeful that the pull of my future would eventually find me. I had read a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes stating, “Most people go to their grave with their music still inside them”, and vowing to myself not to be one of them, began dreaming of searching for my song, my calling.</p>

<p>Throughout my years in the corporate world, I was often visited by images of fire, injured or angry animals, destruction and the lack of having a voice. These dreams, though disturbing and upsetting, encouraged me to work on myself, to begin to heal the areas of my own personality that were far from being whole and complete. My vacations were spent going to spiritual retreats with the goal of learning something else about myself that I could transform. It was obvious to me that I had to dig deep in order to find my strength, my confidence, and my voice.</p>

<p>As my life evolved, I was often visited by dreams of healing and the desire to make a difference. There was an overall sense of unseen forces at work in my life represented by images such as alchemy, guides, mysterious people or animals, finding treasures and themes of metaphysical elements at work. These dreams helped me to remember that I was not on my path alone, and that there was help coming from somewhere else.</p>

<p>In 1998 I was given my first song in a dream. <em>“I start this process of cleaning up and recycling, and eventually all the remaining people start to help too, and now we are all working together toward the same goal of cleaning up the Land. As we are doing this, I start hearing an Indian song, one I’ve never heard before and it just repeats over and over as we pick up the trash. Everyone works an area at a time like we’re a human machine picking up the trash in a herd type fashion. I notice some other people now showing up, dark people, but I don’t think anything of it as I continue to clean. But the song continues and more and more people show up and now I realize that they are hairy and naked, like old ancestral primitives and they are holding staffs. Still, I continue cleaning, but now they have encircled us at the top of this mountain area. I suddenly realize that these are the people of the Land! They never say a word, but they acknowledge what we are doing by showing themselves to us, which is so rare and such an honor, a reverence takes place between us. I see the looks in their eyes as they stand here proud and strong which is hard to explain. They are still living on the Land and watching over it. They are grateful. I hear a voice say, “Social Knowledge Keeps Us Both”, like living together in harmony, honoring one another for our lives and our differences.”</em> The idea of cleaning up the Land, became more a representation of cleaning up the emotional and spiritual land of people I would eventually work with. </p>

<p>Continuing to watch for indications of what I should do with my life, I dreamed that I myself would be doing dreamwork in a larger way when <em>“I am at a conference and Stephen asks me if I’ll introduce the next set of people, which I do, but then feel bad because I don’t know enough to say anything more than that about them, and I need to be better prepared.”</em> Based on this dream, the next night I attended a local Toastmasters meeting whose name was Rhetorical Link where two of the dream images were represented in physical form. The first was the name of the Toastmasters group represented as a family surname in the dream (Link), and the names Bob and Hope, which came up when the main presenter made the unsolicited comment that, “Well even Bob Hope says he still gets nervous every time he speaks.” I knew then and there that I was being guided to this place, and I spent the next two years learning the skill.</p>

<p>The next clue came in 2001 when I dream, <em>“It’s fascinating, for “Sound” is traveling between the two Poles, in an energetic way. I can see the night sky behind the poles and so there is a sense of vastness. These little tiny particles of sound travel between the poles, and then bounce off each other. The particles are together like a swarm of bees and travel the same kind of way, it looks the same, and so all these particles fly through the air and then hit one Pole, and as they hit, it sounds like a shattering of breaking glass, but then I can also hear voices and maybe some music for a moment as the particles actually touch the Pole. As soon as they hit one Pole, they start moving to the other Pole, and the same thing happens. I am just blown away by what I am seeing and so fascinated!”</em> Years later, I acknowledge that these poles were the first introduction of the Law of Attraction, and that Like attracts Like which would play a huge role in my soon to be career. </p>

<p>Then, one day after years of asking to be shown something more specific, a Law of Attraction Life Coaching opportunity presented itself and I knew intuitively that this was what I had been preparing for. As a Life Coach I could combine all my years of personal study and knowledge to create a healing business to empower people to transform their lives in a positive way.</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize that everything has its time. What’s important is that we begin the gestation period by first planting the seeds and then watering them little by little to allow them to grow into full bloom. For me, it was never just one dream that moved me onto my path, but the unfolding of a dream series called my life, in story… one night at a time.</p>

<p>I have since completed my Certification as a Law of Attraction Life Coach, and hold two certifications through the Pacifica Graduate Institute where I was trained by Dr. Stephen Aizenstat Ph.D. in his method of DreamTending. My Life Coaching business, <em>Living with Purpose… On Purpose</em> is a combination of life coaching, dreamwork, and a life’s worth of experience and spiritual practice. It is a direct result of following the guidance received in my dreams. I now inspire and guide people to do the same utilizing the Law of Attraction and the wisdom of their dreams which I also write articles about. Decades past my original interests, I now consider myself a healer of sorts, and get to enjoy the pleasures of reading and writing in a way that supports my calling.</p>

<p>I believe that similar to James Hillmans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman/#The_Soul.27s_Code">“Acorn Theory”</a>, we are all born with a sense of who we are to become already built within us. The guidance system that helps to reveal these gifts is that of dreams and intuitions, showing us where we feel our desires and our emotional responses allowing us to choose which direction will best serve us. Dreams help us navigate the waters of identifying who we are and what we truly want to be through their ability to move us emotionally, mentally, spiritually, physically and symbolically. When listened to deeply and given proper attention, dreams offer a highly calibrated guidance system designed to help us stay on track, correcting our direction by suggesting adjustments in our thinking, actions, decisions and relationships so that we can live the life we desire, the life of our dreams. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Let’s assume for a moment that Life is a dream. This means that we can use dream techniques on waking life events or situations. Go ahead. Try it: </p>

<p>Pick something from your everyday, waking life — say, an unexpected change in your job, or that near-miss on the freeway, or perhaps an emotionally charged encounter with someone — and take a step back to look at that event or situation ‘as if’ it were a dream or a scene from a dream. Apply your favorite dream tech-nique(s) to this event or situation. What do you notice? Now take another unusual waking life event or situation and look at that as if it were a dream. Now look at any waking life event or situation as if it were a dream. </p>

<p>How does the dream world show up in your waking life? </p>

<p>How do you know that you are NOT dreaming, right now? </p>

<p>When we work with our dreams, we have tools to enhance our everyday life—and to explore this dream we call ‘waking life’. </p>

<p>How do you work with dreams? What are your favorite techniques? However you look at dreams, use those tools to look at waking life. See the people, places, actions, emotions, etc. in a waking life event or situation as if it were a dream event or dream fragment. What do you notice? What do you see? What do you learn about yourself in this exercise? What do you learn about your relationship(s)? Your body? Your job? Your life’s calling? Your choices? </p>

<p>In the 1980’s, I spent hours each day/ week recording dreams and working with the dream tools and techniques I was learning. I incubated dream questions, intended lucid dream experiences, wrote about my dreams, read dream books, etc. In short, I immersed myself in the world of dreams and dove deep with the intention of dissolving the culturally-constructed barrier between waking life and dreaming life. Somewhere in all this dreamwork, I began to intentionally look at unusual or out of the ordinary waking life events and situations: a child’s doll, lost/discarded along a wet curb; an argument with a co-worker; found money; odd objects that caught my attention for some reason. What happened ‘woke me up’ more than I expected! </p>

<p>As anyone who works with dreams knows, the more attention one pays to dreams, the more detailed and vivid they can become. Coupled with a desire to become lucid while awake in consensus reality, this intensive dreamwork began to thin the veil between worlds. My waking life became richer and spoke to me in surprising and personally meaningful ways. My dream life became more alive. Using several methods to remind myself that I was dreaming (while sleeping and while awake), the pre-lucid and lucid dreams became more frequent. Then, one day, the dream-world appeared in waking-life reality—I literally walked into a recurring dream-image! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>That day I went to a particular room I had been to several times before. Nothing was out of the ordinary on ‘this side’ of the door (no signs or announcements). However, when I opened the door, the room was obviously in the midst of significant remodeling— spaces that were normally private were completely exposed (!).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This room, this image, came from dreamtime and said, very clearly, <em>‘waking and dreaming are one.’</em> The world shifted, expanded, and I knew that if I crossed the thresh-hold and entered that room my life would not— could not—be the same. I wish I could say I eagerly stepped into the room. What I discovered instead was a strong attachment to my ‘ordinary’ (albeit uncomfortable) life. In that room, anything/everything was possible... but required more than I was willing to give up. I closed the door without entering the room. </p>

<p>Then the circumstances of my life began to change, leaving less time for intensive dreamwork. I was still connected to my dreams, however, and started my first dream group around that time. </p>

<p>I never quite let go of looking at waking life events and situations ‘as if’ they were dreams. One eye stayed open for dream images in waking life. I still draw on these concepts in dream groups and workshops. Sometimes I look back on that day, that choice, with the wistfulness of wishing I had been ‘braver’ at the time. Change continued, as it does, in steps large and small. Something profound had touched me, and although my life seemed safely ‘ordinary,’ my interest in non-ordinary reality and dreams gave it an unusual flavor. Now, years later, I seek again something like that room, to enter and take that leap, to consciously cross the thresh-hold, and actively embrace a non-ordinary life in which ‘waking and dreaming are one.’ </p>

<p>Sometimes waking-life dreams are personal, circumstances surrounding a sudden head-dive and broken finger, for example. Even in the emergency room, I joked/talked with my friend, “If this were a dream, what would it be telling me?” Sometimes a waking dream includes others, as when several of us headed out of town to meet with another dreamworker, the driver had car trouble that stopped us in our tracks. The part(s) that failed held significance on several levels. And sometimes a waking dream is part of the collective psyche, as with Sept. 11 or hurricane Katrina. </p>

<p>Viewing the events and situations of waking life ‘as if’ they are dreams allows another, larger, dimension to open in our personal/collective world. We are not as separate from ourselves or from each other as some would have us believe. We are not alone and are not powerless in the face of disaster or tragedy. It is possible to see more of one’s self, and the world, with the help of these ‘waking dreams.’ Working with waking life events as dreams can help each of us become more conscious in our lives. As each person becomes more conscious (in interactions, choices, etc.), the world (and the world view) will, of necessity, change. </p>

<p>We are all connected. Life is a dream – a great big, collective, group dream. Let us wake up in our dreaming life. Let us wake up in our waking life. </p>

<p>Let us become conscious. Emerge from the cocoon. Let’s wake up. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post_bcpov6zwater_0.jpg" alt="Dream collage" /></p>

<p>In looking at my dreams, I often see reflections of my negative actions, thoughts, and feelings. By examining them closely and being completely honest with myself, I’ve come to discover who I am, why I am who I am, and more importantly, who I am meant to be. This is an ongoing and continuing process; I am forever changing for the better, which is also reflected in my dreams. This became evident a few months ago when I had a dream that I titled, “Another Tidal Wave,” which reminded me of a previously recurring dream titled, “Water, Water Everywhere.” A comparison of the two was very revealing. </p>

<h3>Water, Water Everywhere</h3>

<p><em>I am at the beach, alone. I savor the peace and quiet as the warm surf rolls under my feet tugging gently at my ankles. Suddenly, the water is up to my knees and I find it difficult to walk. I head for shore and I am scared. The shore gets further and further away and the water gets higher and higher.</em> </p>

<p><em>I see a building in the distance and I know that I must reach it or I will drown. My heart pounds in my chest, as the water continues to get higher and higher. I find myself at the door of the building. I look behind me; the water is about to overtake me. I open the door and make it inside. I know that I am safe.</em> </p>

<p>I look around; the building is empty. I go to a small window and see the water is above the window line. The building is submerged in water, yet I feel safe. The above was a recurring dream I had for over 20 years, starting when I was about 12 years old. It was always the same for many years. At some point, I began to notice a few (one at first, then two or three) other people in the building. When I was about thirty-two years old or so, the window seemed to get larger and larger -- until the walls were literally made of glass, at which point the dreams stopped. I have not had this dream for over fifteen years now. </p>

<p>To understand the interpretation, you should know that there were several incidents in my adolescence that I repressed -- in other words, locked away deep in my unconscious. </p>

<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The Ocean signifies that the dream is referring to my unconscious. The water is overtaking me and I am afraid that unless I go inside the building, I will drown. If the water symbolizes my emotions, then the fear of drowning indicates that I was afraid that my emotions would overwhelm me. Therefore, I needed to find shelter from these emotions and went inside the building —inside of myself. </p>

<p>At first, I was alone in the building. At some point, I became aware of other people. These other “people” were actually me. For each repressed incident that occurred in my life, another part of “me” went “inside” where it was safe. </p>

<p>The window allowed me a glimpse of the emotions (the “water”) that I was afraid of. In the beginning, the window was very small, and seeing the water going over the top of it, reinforced my belief that going inside the shelter was the right thing to do--it saved me. The window got larger and larger as I matured and learned how to deal with these emotions that I repressed for so long. In the end, the walls were completely transparent. I no longer needed to hide in the building, as I was no longer afraid of drowning in my emotions. So, the dreams stopped. </p>

<h3>Another Tidal Wave</h3>

<div class="media-item resp-container"><iframe class="resp-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EilI5nTha6M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><em>I am on a balcony overlooking a beach. I know that I am not alone. To my left is my “guide” and to my right, I sense two or three women, though I do not see them. Out on the beach I see several people walking. I look out to the ocean and see a huge tidal wave approaching the shore. I start yelling at the people on the beach to run for safety. Then I see a baby on the edge of the surf, alone. I point to the baby and yell at the people to, “Save the baby, save the baby!” Everyone runs off and leaves the baby on the shore alone with the tidal wave getting closer.</em> </p>

<p><em>The scene shifts slightly. Now I am on the balcony with these same women and my guide, only we are completely underwater, though I am not afraid. I see a scorpion drift by. One of the “women” warns me to be careful as it might sting, but I am drawn to the scorpion and reach out my hand to touch it. It stings me on my palm. I look at my palm, but it doesn’t hurt. I know that I will be OK. The scene shifts again. We have moved inside and I hear a Special News Bulletin on the TV. The announcer is saying, “Tidal wave hits beach, baby dies.”</em> I wake up. </p>

<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The similarities to my earlier, recurring Water, Water Everywhere dream are apparent; however there are significant differences. While the beach, ocean and the impending wave are similar and symbolize the same things, my viewpoint, or perspective, is different. In the original dream, I am on the beach and the danger is imminent. In the new dream, I am able to view the impending tidal wave from a higher, safer perspective--a clear sign to me of personal growth. In the original dream, I must seek shelter, or hide. Here, I feel no need to run or hide. Also, in the original dream, I am inside the building with the water all around, while in the more recent one, I remain outside on a balcony, outside of myself (the building); and even when the water overtakes me, I am unafraid and I know I am not alone. The scorpion stings me but I am not hurt. </p>

<p>It so happens that my partner in life and dreams, Bob Van de Castle, is a Scorpio. I know he will not hurt me – and no matter what emotional upheaval occurs, he will be there and I know I will be OK.</p>

<p>The announcement that the baby dies might seem, at first, to be negative or dangerous, but (if the baby signifies an immature part of me, then the baby <em>dying</em> means that this part of me has matured, or I am no longer in need of it. The baby has died and in its place is a mature woman ready to accept and deal with whatever comes -- and I am not alone. </p>

<p>It was only in comparing the recent dream to the older dream that I was able to completely understand and appreciate how far I have come over the years. I am grateful for my dreams and the messages they provide. I know I am on the right path. ∞</p>

<p>My career started as a photojournalist for a weekly town newspaper. My style has evolved to include nature, dreamscapes, landscapes, and travel &amp; tourism. I’ve been awarded grants and won awards for my imagery, and have exhibited on both coasts of the United States.</p>

<p><em>Photography Then–</em> My first “real job” was at a local newspaper in my hometown. After talking with the editor, he gave me a few photo assignments on a trial basis. A month into this new photojournalist position, I had my first of many front page photos.  It meant lugging 50 pounds of camera equipment through seventeen local communities on assignment for human interest and breaking news stories (and through all types of crazy New England weather, too!) I stayed with the newspaper for 7 years before enrolling in computer training school.</p>

<p>My formal art training at Rhode Island School of Design included alternative photographic processes and design.</p>

<p><em>Photography Now –</em> I have been exploring the links between art, visual therapy, and the realities of the dream state for many years. My work, while being a deeply personal exploration of my own dreams, jars the viewer with its beauty of light interplay, form, and design. Its my intention to create a tactile beauty that brings viewers into my private world while simultaneously giving one the permission to touch, feel, and experience each piece, while making it part of his/her own world, language, and life.</p>

<p>I take a very “Zen” / organic approach in creating recognizable images that strike a resonate chord. My approach to making photos is a quietly hidden metaphor for the ever changing fluidity of our dreams and frailty of beauty. A haunting reminder of how both shimmer before us, but can disappear in the blink of an eye. An eternal aide memoir that everything is not always as it appears to be.</p>

Her suggestions are grounded in cutting edge paradigms." Stanley Krippner, PhD. Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University</p>

<p>How I, Janice Baylis, got interested in dreams: In 1959 a fellow teacher had major surgery. We set up a car pool where I picked her up in a strip mall parking lot and drove the 30 miles to our school.  One morning Mabel phoned and asked me to meet her around the corner on the residential street.  She said she didn't like her car taking up space in the store lot all day. </p>

<p>I said, "Okay."</p>

<p>As Mabel was getting into my car that morning, we heard an enormous CRASH!  A small airplane had landed upside down in the corner of the parking lot where we would have been.  Then she told me she had dreamed it during the night. "WOW!" exclaimed my eight year old son, Brad, from the backseat.</p>

<p>That launched me on a life-long, self-directed and academic study of dreams. From the first, the practical side of dreaming has been my focus.  The Edgar Cayce dream material was the first I found to study.  He also emphasized the practical aspects--health, finances, job, creativity, and interpersonal, as well as the personality growth and spiritual aspects.</p>

<p>With my BA degree in Education and a MA degree in Psychology, I got a credential/license to teach dream-study at the community college level.  I taught 36 hour, semester, night classes and weekend workshops.  My students urged me to write a book, so I wrote Sleep On It! The Practical Side of Dreaming in 1977. </p>

<p>In my teaching I found many dreams use overt sexual imagery and that people were confused by the symbolism of sexual images.  I made this a secondary focus of my dream work.</p>

I love inspiring others to expand the horizons of their dream worlds and above all I treasure the incidents that reveal our ultimate connectedness.</p>

<p>It's been my hope since my first childhood mutual dream that science would advance beyond its hesitancy to acknowledge, let alone explore, that which isn't readily replicable and measurable with current technology. Dreams seem such an accessible gateway to the science of consciousness - what could be better than an International Association for the Study thereof? I only wish I'd found it 25 years ago.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, I was working as a counselor for the City &amp; County of San Francisco. These kids were from broken homes and they had generally experienced little but abuse and neglect throughout their lives. As that time I was interested in how fantasy and creativity (and lack of it) played a role in development, but I didn't know much about dreams.</p>

<p>I began studying with Jungian analysts in San Francisco in the early 1980s, and found that dreams provided not only a wonderful arena for exploring fantasy and creativity but also provided a soulful feedback system and continual inner dialogue. After a few years I began studying with other people who worked with dreams in many other ways and shifted my focus away from pure Jungian dreamwork</p>

<p>I was especially interested in the lack of education that therapists were receiving in graduate counseling programs and began a dream tutoring practice to allow counselors from various modalities to respond to their clients' dreams in a more sophisticated manner. I felt a little boxed in by the work. The one-to-one contact was meaningful, but I felt I was not reaching a large enough audience. Also, the notion of dreams only being in the service of healing seemed limited. I wanted something that involved the wider culture. Both of these needs came together when I first experienced the Internet.</p>

<p>I began developing a wide variety of programs to network dreamworkers, distribute news, experiment with online dream sharing and provide information and education on dreams. This kind of global networking seemed the natural extension of the grassroots Dream Movement that had been developing since the 1960s, and I modeled much of the online community around this. The first part of the model I found in local dream sharing groups such as those made popular by Strephon William-Kapalan, Jeremy Taylor, Gayle Delaney, Stan Kirppner, Montague Ullman, and many others. Another grassroots trend was a networked outpouring of information, education and creative group projects that included such organizations as BADG (Bay Area Dreamworkers Group), the Dream Library and Archive, and the Dream Network Journal.</p>

<p>My initial online community, the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/ed/">Electric Dreams</a> Community, had, and still maintains at its core, a peer/partnership paradigm, and a focus towards online dream sharing. As new Internet projects came up, various members volunteered to coordinate and direct them. In this way the community remained a public service, being able to offer a monthly magazine (e-zine), continual online dream groups, the Global Dreaming News, and other projects.</p>

<p>About the same time, I noticed that there was a great need for education about dreams and dreaming and started the DreamGate classes online which offered not only a background in the field of dreams, but hands-on groups through the Net.</p>

<p>In 1996 I was part of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) Conference Committee and developed the Computer and Internet Resource and Exhibition Center for the Berkeley Conference, as well as contributing to the initial development of the IASD presence online and IASD web site, which I now manage for IASD. I have been very impressed by the way IASD attempts to provide a way for all fields to come together and study dreams encompassing all sides of the dream field, from anthropology, dream therapies, dreams and spiritual work, dream inspired art and literature, non-clinical dreamwork, dream telepathy, dream bio-physiology, and many other disciplines.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, I was the IASD Webmaster, the Chair of the Electronic Communications Committee, and provided regular articles on dreaming and dreamwork online to the IASD magazine, Dream Time in the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/dream/cyberphile/">Cyberphile column</a>. This has allowed me to develop the online projects for IASD with many, many people from around the world, and unfold the IASD mission to provide dream education for the public and to make the Association a truly international enterprise. For example, beginning in 2002, IASD began offering an international online conference with Ed Kellogg, Ph.D., call the PsiberDreaming Conference, for which I built the technical infrastructure.</p>

<p>In 2005 I became the IASD Operations Director, managing the IASD office and its operations at the office in Berkeley. In 2018 the office went virtual and is now PO Box 206, Novato, CA 94948</p>

<p>Another interest has been interested in the application of philosophy to dreamwork. How can the application of novel ideas compliment and further the developments in dreamwork?</p>

<p>My approach to assisting individuals and groups find their genius is based on the following understanding:</p>

<p>​I know that by divine design, and through evolution, our mind is without limitation and is capable of clearly and accurately seeing into the future through each “now” moment. And that the now is available to us to the degree that we have released the confines of the past.</p>

<p>I know that each human is a sovereign being capable of unlimited understanding and creative insights. We are gifted of tremendous feats of accomplishment through true collaboration with others.</p>

<p>​Because our mind is not bound within our body, it is not governed by matter’s laws of physics and our mind influences matter at every level through the harmonics of our prevailing attitude toward life.</p>

<p>​Releasing the unresolved issues from our past releases our unique gifts of intuitive reasoning. When we release our need to be right about past issues we naturally move our conscious awareness to ever expanding dimensions of knowing.</p>

<p>​We are able to attract or manifest anything we determine is vital to our purposeful needs.</p>

<p>I lived totally without cents since Autumn of 2000 (except for a couple months in 2001) until the Spring of 2016, when I started caring for my aging parents, managing their finances. For 15 years I didn't use or accept money or conscious barter - nor did I take food stamps or other government dole. My philosophy has been to use only what is freely given or discarded and what is already present and already running (whether or not I existed). I don't see money as evil or good: how can illusion be evil or good? But I don't see heroin or meth as evil or good, either. Which is more addictive and debilitating, money or meth? Attachment to illusion makes you illusion, makes you not real. Attachment to illusion is called idolatry, called addiction. I simply got tired of acknowledging as real this most common world-wide belief called money! I simply got tired of being unreal. Money is one of those intriguing things that seems real and functional because 2 or more people believe it is real &amp; functional!</p>

<p>I am a dreamworker and author of Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming: A Personal Journey in Dream Interpretation. My current focus is on teaching others how to interpret and work with their own dreams. I have created several <a href="https://theazire.org/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11">online courses on dream interpretation</a>. I am also available to do workshops and one-on-one consultations via phone or Skype.</p>

<p>My interest in dreams began in 1988, after I left my husband of 13 years.  At that time, two dreams kept recurring over and over again; dreams which I had since I was 12. I knew these dreams were trying to tell me something, but didn’t know just what. In 1994, I discovered the book, Our Dreaming Mind, by <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Dr. Robert L. Van de Castle</a>, which helped me understand the process of dreaming.  With further reading and research, I began to slowly learn to decipher my dreams.</p>

<p>I have been actively enlightening others online about dreams since 2001, when I created my original Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming website to share my experience of learning to interpret my own dreams. Then, in late September 2008, I connected with Dr. Robert Van de Castle at an online PsiberDreaming Conference put on by the <a href="http://asdreams.org/">International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD)</a>. A few short weeks, several lengthy phone calls and numerous emails later, I left New Jersey and moved to Charlottesville, VA to live and work with him until his passing in January 2014. Working closely with Dr. Van de Castle, we created and taught an online course for Atlantic University, Becoming a Teacher of Dreamwork/Dream Interpretation. We also presented together at several conferences and co-authored an article for Explore! journal, <a href="http://www.explorejournal.com/article/S1550-8307(10)00099-6/abstract">Dreams As a Multidimensional Expression of PSI</a>.</p>

<p>I am an active member of the IASD for over 15 years and an elected member of the Board of Directors from 2014-2017. As such, I adhere to their <a href="http://www.asdreams.org/ethics-and-confidentiality/">ethical guidelines in dreamworking</a> which “supports an approach to dreamwork and dream sharing that respects the dreamer’s dignity and integrity, and which recognizes the dreamer as the decision-maker regarding the significance of the dream.” In other words, only the dreamer knows what their dream means. My goal in life is to help you learn to understand what yours are saying to you.</p>

<p>I believe that our dreams are the key to becoming more aware of who we are, why we are who we are and who we are supposed to be. If you care to join me, I’d like to help you learn to interpret your dreams as I have learned to do.</p>

<p>Evelyn Duesbury is a National Certified Counselor (NCC), a Board Certified TeleMental Health Provider (BC-TMH-CCE), and a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). She is a member of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the American Psychological Association (APA), the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors (IAMFC), the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD), and The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi.</p>

<p>Duesbury’s earlier careers included working as a private secretary for patent attorneys, bankers, accountants, and general practice attorneys. After earning a B.A. in accounting and an MBA, she became a public accountant, then changed careers to education as an associate professor of accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. In 2000, Duesbury’s master of counselor education thesis, “Utilizing Dreams from a Systemic Perspective to Understand and Mollify Relationship Issues,” received the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s Outstanding Thesis Award. Since that time Duesbury and colleagues researched and explored her thesis-based Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID) for seven additional projects. During those years, Duesbury developed and taught a distance education course to counselors on how to use her PMID model. The course guide that she wrote for her distance education class is the foundation for The Counselor’s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams: Family and Other Relationship Systems Perspectives.</p>

<p>Before writing The Counselor’s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams Duesbury worked on other projects. First, with assistance from her son, a writer, and consultation from E. B. Bynum, a clinical psychologist, Duesbury published a self-help book for the general population titled Living Dreams, Living Life, a Practical Guide to Understanding Your Dreams and How They Can Change Your Waking-Life. One night, after thinking about updating her distance education course guide, she thought to herself, “I am so occupied that I am unable to give time to my own dreams the way I want.” The next morning she woke with a dream that persuaded her to put her plans of working exclusively with her own dreams on hold. In the dream, her former accounting advisor suggested (in dream language) that she should transform her distance counseling course book into a “universal systems book.”</p>

<p>In waking-life several years earlier, an advisor had told Duesbury he had taken several positions to prepare him to do what he loves, teach. Duesbury likewise discovered that she loves to teach. She loves to show others how to use their dreams to improve their lives.</p>

<p>Robert’s background in dream work is varied. He has been involved with the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) for over 25 years. Through this organization, he has enjoyed the benefit of multidiscipline dream work expertise from around the world. He is a past president of IASD and has hosted multiple international dream conferences. He is a graduate of the two-year Dream Leader Training program offered by The Haden Institute in Charlotte. It was here that he gained much of his knowledge of Jungian archetypes. He was ordained through Sancta Sophia Seminary in Oklahoma's modern day wisdom school. The seminary opened his eyes to the relationships between dreams, astrology, and the ancient wisdom teachings.</p>

<p>Robert has a Master of Arts degree in guidance and counseling from Wayne State University in Detroit. He has also completed a year of Ph.D. level work in spiritual studies.</p>

<p>As early as 1970, He was organizing and leading dream discussion groups. His first was when he was serving with the United States Air Force in Turkey. Since then, he has conducted workshops on dreams in the Metropolitan D.C. area and in North Carolina. He designed a four-part mini course on dreams, which was well received in Asheville, NC. It was in these courses and workshops that he fully realized the importance of themes in the dream work process and the need for formal guidelines on the subject. He has found that themes are the most misunderstood aspect of dream work.</p>

<p>He is the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Exploration-Approach-Robert-Gongloff/dp/0738708186">Dream Exploration: A New Approach</a>, which helps dreamers identify the core "theme" - the "heart" - of the dream; and is co-editor of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-That-Change-Our-Lives/dp/1630514292">IASD book, Dreams that Change Our Lives</a>, and the second volume of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Dreams-Understanding-Biology-Psychology-Culture/dp/1440856168">Dreams: Understanding Biology, Psychology, and Culture</a>.

<p>Marlene started her first dream journal at age 8. She has accumulated volumes since then filled with images, feelings, symbolism and characters that never fail to educate and inspire her and elucidate her waking world. Her philosophy is that working with people and their dreams is all about pulling in the pieces the unconscious hands us in our dreams, and integrating them into waking life to add dimension and arrive at that “ah-ha” meaning.</p>

<p>As a professional art therapist and active member in the dream community for over 35 years, her approach to dreamwork is both intuitive and eclectic, and is sensitive to each person based on her toolbox of knowledge and experience of working with individuals and groups. She believes that a creative approach to dreamwork via expressive means can be done through journaling, art, dance, writing or Gestalting with dream imagery or any expressive method meaningful to the dreamer.</p>

<p>Marlene served on the board and was a regular contributor to <a href="../@dreamnetwork">Dream Network Journal</a> for nearly two decades. Her column, “Dream Times,” appeared there and in the North Kitsap Herald. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Consider the words of astronaut Edgar Mitchell, <em>"There are no unnatural or supernatural phenomena, only very large gaps in our knowledge of what is natural."</em></p>

<p>I used to say I was a convert from outer space to inner space, having a professional life in the aerospace industry during its early years, and eventually ending up much later fully immersed in the dreamwork field. I've become aware that all of my life experiences and interests have led to a greater understanding of myself and the world in which I live, as well as the many possibilites that exist beyond, yet to be explored.</p>

<p>In 1959, I nearly burned to death in an industrial accident, the explosion of rocket fuel in a laboratory in which I worked for one of our earliest pioneers in the aerospace industry. My life was saved by Ed Butler, a co-worker, who had repeated nightmares about the accident and rescuing me. When it happened in waking reality, he did as he had in the dreams, and I am alive because of his "dream rehearsals", as he calls them. Much of my life since that time has been a search to understand and use these wonderful gifts we are given nightly, particularly those mysterious experiences, such as telepathy, precognition, and other anomalous phenomena which current scientific theories can't fully explain but which happen to persons of all ages, cultures and belief systems. This search has led to a deeper understanding of the connectedness of all humans/dreamers and all of life, animate as well as what we label inanimate, which is nonetheless brimming with energy. We have enormous powers of the mind, waking and sleeping, and we're not using them... because we don't know we can. That is my current goal, to spread the good news and to make others aware not only of the collective unconscious which Carl Jung described, but also of a collective consciousness that drives our actions and our society. Beyond that, there is a sense of the universal collective that impacts upon everything in our universe.</p>

<p>In 1983, the same year that we founded the Metro D.C. Dream Community (MDCDC) in Vienna, VA, a Washington, DC suburb, I read of plans to hold an international multidisciplinary meeting on dreams. Persons were invited to send financial backing and thus become Founding Life Members of what was to become the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD). I sent in my $100 and have been hooked on MDCDC and IASD ever since! </p>

<p>Born in 1956, Paul Levy grew up in Yonkers, New York. In the mid-seventies he went to college at what was then called the State University of New York at Binghamton (now called Binghamton University), receiving degrees in both economics and studio art. While an undergraduate at Binghamton, he was hired by Princeton University to do research in economics. When he graduated college, he stopped his studies in economics and pursued his career in art, moving out to the Bay Area, where he was both making, and teaching art.</p>

<p>In 1981, due to an intense personal trauma, he had a life-changing spiritual awakening in which he began to recognize the dreamlike nature of reality. During the first year of his spiritual emergence, Paul was hospitalized a number of times, and was told he was having a severe psychotic break from reality. Much to his surprise, he was (mis)diagnosed as having a chemical imbalance and was informed that he had what was then called manic-depression (now called bi-polar disorder), and that he would have to live with his illness for the rest of his life and would need to take medication till his dying breath.</p>

<p>Little did the doctors realize, however, that he was taking part in a mystical awakening/shamanic initiation process, which at times mimicked psychosis but in actuality was a spiritual experience of a far different order, completely off the map of the psychiatric system. Fortunately, he was able to extricate himself from the medical and psychiatric establishment so that he could continue his process of self-discovery. Thankfully, as Paul freed himself from the shackles of psychiatry, he found his spiritual teachers, who instead of seeing Paul as crazy, recognized that he was beginning to spiritually awaken.</p>

<p>An artist, after the trauma of his shamanic break-down/break-through, he became a certified art teacher. Due to his interest in the work of C. G. Jung, by the end of the decade he became the manager of the C. G. Jung Foundation Book Service in New York, as well as the advertising manager for the Jungian journal Quadrant. In 1993, after many years of struggling to contain and integrate his non-ordinary experiences, Paul started to openly share his insights about the dreamlike nature of reality. He began giving talks and facilitating groups based on how life is a shared waking dream that we are all co-creating and co-dreaming together. He is the founder of the Awakening in the Dream Community in Portland, Oregon. </p>

<p>A pioneer in the field of spiritual emergence, Paul is a wounded healer in private practice, helping others who are also awakening to the dreamlike nature of reality. His work has gone through three phases: because of his intense interest in dreams (both night dreams and the dreamlike nature of reality), he was first known as "the dream guy." After writing <em>Dispelling Wetiko</em>, he became associated with the idea of wetiko. After the publication of <em>The Quantum Revelation</em>, he is now seen as connected with quantum physics. All three aspects - dreams, wetiko and quantum physics are interconnected and complementary facets of a deeper reality into which he is continually deepening his investigation. </p>

<p>He is the author of <em>The Madness of George Bush: A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis</em> (2006), <em>Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil</em> (2013), <em>Awakened by Darkness: When Evil Becomes Your Father</em> (2015) and <em>The Quantum Revelation: A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality</em> (2018). A Tibetan Buddhist practitioner for over 30 years, he has intimately studied with some of the greatest spiritual masters of Tibet and Burma. He was the coordinator of the Portland chapter of the PadmaSambhava Buddhist Center for over twenty years. </p>

<p>Christopher and his work have been featured just about everywhere, including Netflix, HBO, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, NPR, <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Times of London</em></strong>, <strong><em>Playboy</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong>, <strong><em>Time</em></strong>, <strong><em>Newsweek</em></strong>, and <strong><em>The Atlantic</em></strong>. Chris has been a featured speaker at TED, SXSW, The Festival of Dangerous Ideas at the Sydney Opera House, the Einstein Forum in Pottsdam, Germany, and is a frequent guest on The Joe Rogan Experience and many other podcasts. He’s also provided expert testimony in a Canadian constitutional hearing and appeared in dozens of documentary films and television shows.</p>

<p>Even before co-authoring the <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong> best-seller, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XSJOTi">Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What it Means for Modern Relationships</a></em> (translated into 18 languages), with Cacilda Jethá, MD, Chris was on a wild ride. After receiving a BA in English and American literature in 1984 he spent the next two decades traveling around the world, pausing in unexpected places to work at decidedly odd jobs (e.g., gutting salmon in Alaska, teaching English to prostitutes in Bangkok and self-defense to land-reform activists in Mexico, managing commercial real-estate in New York’s Diamond District, helping Spanish physicians translate and publish their research). In his mid-30s, Chris decided to pursue doctoral studies in Psychology at Saybrook Graduate School, in San Francisco, CA, using his dissertation to critique mainstream views of human sexual evolution — providing the core arguments later advanced in Sex at Dawn.</p>

<p>Chris’s latest book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JI8Y1O">Civilized to Death: The Price of Progress</a></em> (Simon &amp; Schuster/Avid Reader Press, 2019), questions whether civilization has actually been a net benefit to our species. He hosts a weekly podcast, <em><a href="https://chrisryanphd.com/category/tangentially-speaking/">Tangentially Speaking</a></em>, often recorded from the road, while traveling in his van, Scarlett Jovansson. The podcast features conversations with famous comics, bank robbers, drug smugglers, porn stars, authors, and rattlesnake experts.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Ann used Milton Erickson's common-sense and self hypnosis approach to dreams. She used art, dreams, and closed eye visioning in workshop intensives here and abroad. She taught at Lesley College Arts Institute, where she helped develop the Expressive Therapies Program, trained teachers, and earned her Master’s degree. Ann kept dream journals for fifty years, published two books on dreams, and was an ASD member and presenter for over 20 years, offering workshops and slide talks at IASD (almost every year), and at California’s Esalen Institute, The Cambridge center for Adult Education, and organizations here and abroad. She derived much inspiration from the work of Patricia Garfield, Freud, Jung, Milton Erickson, Gibran, the I Ching, the Dalai Lama, and others.</p>

<p>This adaptation of her Introduction to her last book, Satisfy the Image, summarizes her work: </p>

<p>Autodrama on the Paper Stage is a concrete mapping method that works for dreams and all kinds of life problems. You create your own symbols to represent the people and things in your story and set them on a sheet of paper we call the stage. Instead of telling the story in words, we use colored paper or found objects to represent characters and significant objects—it’s very simple. As you answer questions about the scene, you begin to understand the problem and manipulate the characters in search of resolution. </p>

<p>As a mini psychodrama, it shrinks the stage to a sheet of paper, eliminates other players, and offers a quick, direct approach. Working alone or with a guide, the dreamer plays all the roles, speaks and hears the dialogue, harvests projections, and negotiates a resolution. </p>

<p>The method came to me in a dream where I saw myself as a tiny human attached to the earth’s globe by gravity. Up in the universal darkness, a giant megaphone shouted “FIND THE IMAGE AND SATISFY IT.” Immediately I understood that the way to resolution was through the image, and the way to the image was through your feelings. </p>

<p>Since the age of three, I drew, painted, designed textiles, perfected and taught various crafts. When I had kids, I made bread sculpture, rag tapestries, furniture, and toys, and then turned it into how-to books. In the 1970’s, as Program Director for the Boston Children’s Museum Visitor Center, I developed how-to workshops so visitors could make paper, build looms and kites, and invent musical instruments from junk. I also conducted workshops for the New Hampshire elementary school system: sixty to ninety teachers came once a week for five-hour sessions on “Methods and Materials” and “Creative Enrichment.” We called it “Kindergarten for creatively deprived adults,” who were then very excited to take the ideas and methods back to their classes. </p>

<p>From there it was a short step to Expressive Therapy, a field just being defined at Lesley College. In addition to teaching there, I designed and completed my own Masters program based on work I did with teachers all over the country and in India. </p>

<p>Dreams were an arrow leading straight to the unconscious. Like parables, they provide perspective on truths too close to see. Visual methods make problem solving exciting because they require you to think outside the box and use all kinds of intelligence and sources of wisdom. Impatient with the time required by conventional dream work, I asked students to “show me your dream. Show me your problem. Create images. Make characters from torn tissue papers or find an object to represent people and things. Set the stage and tell the story on a sheet of paper.” </p>

<p>In half an hour, everyone in a class could create a scene and begin to work using ten simple questions. I just walked around the room helping to move things as needed. And there was the magic of working in groups. People borrowed from each other, saw what others were doing, heard the first solutions, and were inspired to take risks or reach out. Originality was rampant. Everyone left the room with new information, and often with a new resolution. </p>

<p>A Harvard student who took a workshop said, “This work you do is more interesting than all my psychology courses. I’d like my professor to see.” I did a workshop there, but the professor asked what books I was using, what theory? </p>

<p>“No books, no theory—just common sense and the wisdom of the dream, the power of peoples’ images. We simply ‘satisfy the image.’” </p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t going to make much sense to Academe is it?” he says. </p>

<p>“No. I guess not. It is not a theory; it is an experience.” </p>

<p>So you are the system. You are the method. It’s the doing that heals, creates change, and enlightens. When you experience it, you know it. It is the “Aha!” method. </p>

<p>Fred C. Olsen, M.Div. is a teacher, counselor, and consultant who moved from a career in the space program to explore the frontiers of inner space. </p>

<p>He began his professional career in the Fall of 1965 following graduation from Seattle Pacific University with a B.S. in Mathematics. In 1967, Fred accepted a position with RCA International Service Corporation on a traveling team of technicians and engineers which was gearing up to calibrate satellite tracking stations for the NASA STADAN (Space Tracking and Data Acquisition Network), based at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p>In this position, Fred traveled regularly to many countries, where he was able to gain a unique view of a world in ferment during the late 1960s and early 1070s. At NASA, Fred's focus was on identifying the "highest" information that reflected the state of the system. An example was a measure of the ratio of signal to noise and the data quality associated with a range of readings of the ratio of signal to noise.</p>

<p>Olsen's concept of the "inner image" is the "highest information" source in the human psyche, both personally and collectively, what happens when the image changes. More importantly, this is the process by which the image forms and transforms in the human psyche. Jung's concept of the "transcendent function" sheds light on this problem.  The place at which the opposites meet in a balanced tension and equal relationship, is the place where transformation is possible.  If the conscious "ego" dominates, then we are back in the previous dilemma.  If the "ego" succumbs to the authority of the image, transformation is also sublimated and avoided.</p>

<p>Olsen's Inner Image Method lays out the process that has evolved over the last few decades of exploration and refinement of this approach.</p>

<p>Robert L. Van de Castle made his transition from this world on Wednesday, January 29, 2014.</p>

<p>Dr. Van de Castle's life work was devoted to dreams and dream research. He received his B.A in General Psychology at Syracuse University in 1951, his M.A. in Clinical Psychology at University of Missouri in 1953, and his PhD in Clinical Psychology from University of North Carolina in 1959. He was a Professor Emeritus at University of Virginia Health Sciences Center (retired 1993) where he was the Professor of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry (1986-1992), Director of the Clinical Psychology Internship Project (1980-1992) and Director of the Sleep and Dream Laboratory (1967-1985).</p>

<p>He is the author of the book, Our Dreaming Mind, which was described as a "landmark" by <a href="../@montagueullman">Monte Ullman</a>, a "masterpiece" by <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a>, and "a sweeping compilation unsurpassed in the literature for its scope" by <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stan Krippner</a>. With Calvin Hall, he co-authored The Content Analysis of Dreams, which became a standard reference book and a "how-to-do-it" manual for investigators wishing to examine dream content in a quantitative fashion that could be statistically evaluated.</p>

<p>In addition, he always felt that trying to familiarize the public with the fascinating realm of dreams was important. He discussed dreams on such national TV shows as Phil Donahue, Barbara Walters, David Letterman, Tom Snyder, and Mike Douglas. He also presented at two programs involving dreams hosted by Rita Dwyer at the Smithsonian Institution, spoke on the Voice of America radio show, and his articles appeared in prominent newspapers such as The Washington Post, USA Today, and Chicago Tribune and in a wide variety of popular magazines, such as Psychology Today and Ladies Home Journal. He also presented talks and workshops on dreams in Belgium, Canada, Latvia, Mexico and Russia, and attended and presented papers at most of the IASD conferences throughout the years, including those in Holland and Denmark.</p>

<p>He was most proud of his efforts to develop the IASD as an organization that represents a "rainbow coalition" of dreamers from around the world. He was honored to present at the first annual international ASD conference in San Francisco in 1984 and then become the next ASD president. He introduced active participation in dream workshops, the infamous Dream Ball, a Dream Telepathy contest, and sessions on lucid dreaming. He was the recipient of IASD’s first Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition, he was a Past President of the Parapsychological Association (1970). Most recently, he was on the Advisory Board of DreamsCloud, the world's foremost dream related website.</p>

<p>He is survived by his sons, Drake Cameron Van de Castle and Keith Dawson Van de Castle; daughter, Parker Mary York and daughter-in-law, Teresa Spigle Van de Castle. He is also survived by his sister, Mary Elizabeth Hinton; his loving partner of five plus years, <a href="../@bobbieannpimm">Bobbie Ann Pimm</a>, and three grandchildren.</p>

<p>Dale Gottlieb was born in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Saturday mornings. Her work is still inspired by the African art collection. The appeal of primitive art continued to influence her work, with her exploration of Visionary and Outsider artists. Her work, like theirs, appears naïve yet deals with complex emotions and issues concerning humanity. Working in different venues and mediums, her individual sense of color and narrative approach are the connective tissue in the three arenas she pursues—books, paintings and rugs. She received her BFA from the School of Art and Design at Alfred University. Her work has been shown internationally and throughout the United States. She has written and/or illustrated twenty-eight books for children and her editorial illustration has been published in various periodicals, newspapers and books including The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, Sports Illustrated, Esquire, Ms. And others. She currently lives in Bellingham, WA.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were no humans on the planet.  You may be too young to remember, but it seems the earth did just fine in those days.  The earth gave birth to an incredible, rich diversity of life, and yet maintained a delicate, sustainable balance between it all.  Even in the early days of human life, it seemed that we could be part of this magical balance as we found our niche and explored our possibilities.  Sure, we made mistakes in those days, but we could usually learn from those mistakes and try to do better in the next generation.</p>

<p>But recently the humans seem to be acting like the worst kind of invasive species, spreading all over the planet, dominating, killing and destroying everything in sight.  The delicate balance of life has been seriously disrupted by humans.  What is happening here?  Will the humans finally win their war against nature and thus destroy all chance for balance to be restored?   What will it take for humans to change our ways, to strive again for some kind of balance?</p>

<p>Linda Lane Magallón, MBA invested more than 18 years in the field, researching lucid, mutual, telepathic and flying dreams. She was editor of the Dream Network Bulletin alongside <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a> from 1987-1989. </p>

<p>Practicing under the discipline of the "Dream-Art Scientist" (a model based on the Jane Roberts' Seth material), she has mastered many dreaming skills and dreamwork techniques.</p>

<p>Linda authored the ground-breaking book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050308133701/http://members.aol.com/DreamPsi/archive/mutualdreaming.html">Mutual Dreaming</a> (Pocket Books, 1997). She served as editor and publisher of the principal magazine in the dream field, Dream Network. Having written articles for such magazines as FATE, American Psychic Magazine and the OMNI newsletter, she most recently wrote "Dream Trek," a column in the Internet E-zine <a href="http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm">Electric Dreams</a>.</p>

<p>Active in the dreamwork community since 1984, Linda was a founding board member and wrote the first mission statement of the multidisciplinary (and highly academic) <a href="https://www.asdreams.org/">Association For the Study of Dreams</a> (ASD). She has presented papers and hosted panels at several of ASD's annual conferences. In 2001, she helped design the conference web site, the Computer Café, and created the four picture targets for the Dream Telepathy Contest.</p>

<p>With Fred Olsen, she co-founded the Bay Area Dreamworkers Group (BADG), to provide support for her dreamwork peers in the San Francisco area. There, she practiced dream sharing, perfected dreamwork techniques and uncovered the basic values of the Partnership Paradigm. After BADG presented her with an honorary "Doctoral Degree in Social Dreamology," Linda graduated from dreamworker to dreamplayer.</p>

<p>The observer-participant brand of research has required that Linda dream along with the other members of her dreaming team. Searching for active participants in a sleepy field like dreams is not an easy task, whether on-line or off. To help find such dreamers for her half a hundred group dreaming projects and dream telepathy experiments, Linda served as coordinator of the Seth Dream Network and dipped into the lucid dream community before founding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050305230701/http://members.aol.com/lucidflier/project/fbnc.html">Fly-By-Night Club research group</a>.</p>

<p>Linda's goal has been to encourage the emergence of the Super Self through dreams. Her research has lead her to experiment with such flying and floating variations as virtual reality games, scuba diving, ballooning, gliding, hang gliding and flying a Piper Tomahawk. She has found flying dreams to be both extremely practical (resolving nightmares) and highly inspirational (launching further extraordinary dreams). She believes flying dreams to be at the hub of dream understanding and appreciation.</p>

<p>BLOG -- To Consider 2012 <a href="https://toconsider2012.wordpress.com/">www.toconsider2012.wordpress.com</a></p>

<p>A poet, novelist, essayist, storyteller, teacher, healer and medicine woman who has taught and counseled for over fifty years, in the process of which she has developed therapies (Healing Stories) which creatively address life threatening diseases, spiritual and emotional crises, as well as community, political and environmental disintegration.</p>

<p>Deena has spent a lifetime investigating Story as a form of knowing and healing. As a writer, she asks: Who do we have to become to find the forms and sacred language with which to meet these times?</p>

<p>She conducts training groups on the spiritual, creative, political and ethical aspects of healing and peacemaking, individual, community and global, drawing deeply on alliance with spirit, indigenous teachings and the many wisdom traditions. One focus is on uniting Western medical ways with indigenous medicine traditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To follow Story is to understand the path of healing. Each of our stories is a universe. Each one of us is living a story. To discover its shape and essence is essential to soul making.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With writer/healer Michael Ortiz Hill, she has introduced the concept of Daré, meaning Council, to North America. The Topanga Daré relies on Council, alliance with Spirit and the natural world, ancestor work, indigenous and wisdom traditions and teachings, music healing, dream telling, divination, kinship, and story telling to achieve personal transformation, community healing and social change.</p>

<p>She is the author of many books, including the novels;  <em>A Rain of Night Birds</em>, (2017), <em>La Negra y Blanca</em> (2012 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in Literature), <em>Feral</em>; <em>Ruin and Beauty: New and Selected Poems</em>; <em>From Grief Into Vision: A Council; Doors: A Fiction for Jazz Horn</em>; <em>Entering the Ghost River: Meditations on the Theory and Practice of Healing</em>; <em>The Other Hand; What Dinah Thought</em>; <em>Tree: Essays and Pieces</em>; <em>The Woman Who Slept With Men to Take the War Out of Them</em>; and <em>Writing For Your Life</em>.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>By way of introduction, may I share two of the dreams/experiences that compelled me onto this path, an abbreviated dream autobiography. It is, of course, an ongoing adventure.</p>

<p>The event that marked my starting point appeared in the form of a technicolor, stereophonic sound, full length movie-like dream which was the first of its kind in my experience. Its power and beauty were such that I recorded it, not knowing why at the time.</p>

<p>Many other dreams followed, compelling enough that I started journaling regularly and began reading what related literature I could find. But it wasn't until that particular dream took the form of an actual event several years later that I got deeply involved.</p>

<p>This dream occurred during summer 1975 and in it,</p>

<p><em>I find myself in a community center (which in waking life housed the office in which I was working). In every room of this building are people participating in an amazing variety of artistic activities: dancers, singers, musicians, artists...</em></p>

<p>The energy in the dream and afterward was exhilarating!</p>

<p>In the Autumn of l980, the mayor of my community, in his weekly column in the local newspaper, cast an open invitation for "someone" in the community to coordinate an event. I considered accepting that invitation by calling together a group of colleagues to brainstorm ideas and as that process was unfolding, ideas and images were being put forth from members of the group which formed in my mind's eye a clear memory of the above-mentioned dream. To the group I exclaimed "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!" One person responded immediately: "Then we've got to do it!"</p>

<p>The program was scheduled, very well attended... and I found myself presiding over a virtual re-enactment of the dream in full detail. It was the ever-sought-after experience of Being at the intersection between the dreamworld and daytime 'reality.' The occasion for this event was the 35th anniversary of the United Nations.</p>

<p>By the way, the photo (above) was taken during that event:</p>

<p>A Dream Come True! Can you tell?</p>

<p><em>"To live mythically is to seek guidance from your dreams, imagination, and other reflections of your inner being, as well as from the most inspiring people, practices, and institutions of your society.</em></p>

<p><em>To live mythically is also to cultivate an ever-deepening relationship with the universe and its great mysteries."</em></p>

<p>Bambi’s passion and exploration of dreamwork spans over forty years having journaled over eight thousand of her own dreams. She says that working with her dreams for so many years has given her tremendous insight into every aspect of her life; physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Knowing the immense guidance and wisdom available through dreamwork, she has dedicated her life to teaching others to work with and understand their dreams to help bring consciousness and awareness to the ways in which we are informed by the dreamtime to live a more passionate, purposeful and authentic life. She is an avid lover and animals and nature and advocates for their wellbeing, survival and conservancy. </p>

<p>Bambi holds two certifications in Dream Tending, taught by Dr. Stephen Aizenstat of Pacifica Graduate Institute. She serves on the Southern California IASD Regional Committee and has been a member of the International Association for the Study of Dreams for twenty years. Bambi was a review editor for The Dream Network Magazine for nine years and is and certified as a Law of Attraction Certified Coach through The Quantum Success Coaching Academy and a Tarotpy Practitioner through the Institute of Dreams and Tarotpy®. She is also a contributing author for the book, <em>101 Great Ways to Enhance your Career.</em></p>

<p>Below, you can download each volume as a .zip file, or download each issue individually from the list of images. If you'd like to look up an individual author or article, there's a growing <a href="../@dreamnetwork~contributors">authors page</a> here, and a (not-quite-complete) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfm83Fnx9m9Q_Bfu3bpDv2kQqUwDG6exOj-Zny-MnMw/edit?usp=sharing">list of Dream Network articles</a> in spreadsheet form.</p>

<p>Feel free to send the PDFs to your friends, but rather than publishing them online please just link to the archive site once it's public.
