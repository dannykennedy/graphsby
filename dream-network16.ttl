<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>'Face of Jesus' by Noreen Wessling, from Dream Treasure Cards</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<h3>The Universality of Dreams, Revealing "God's Will"</h3>

<p>The sacred narratives of the world are united and speak with one voice on this question: we human beings are more directly connected and in deeper communion with the Divine in our dreams than in any other regular state of conscious awareness. This archetypal connection between dreaming and communion with the Divine is made in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, just as it is in the sacred narratives of all the other world religions. The Torah, the canonical Old and New Testaments, as well as the Jewish and Christian Apocryphal, all relate compelling stories of "God's Will" being revealed to people in and through their dreams. </p>

<h3>The Prohibition Against Dreamwork</h3>

<p>And yet, in virtually all contemporary institutional Jewish and Christian religious practice, remembering and exploring dreams is either clearly prohibited, or at least strongly discouraged. On the face of it, this is a very odd state of affairs. </p>

<p>I believe this ironic circumstance is a direct consequence of the fact that all dreams come in the service of health and wholeness. It is precisely because the authority of Divine Revelation through dreams is so clearly attested to in Scripture that the institutional churches and synagogues almost always find it necessary to discourage and prohibit dreamwork. If it were not prohibited, it would be all too possible for anyone, the scruffier and more malcontent the better (since the archetypal figure of the prophet regularly presents an image of scruffiness and malcontentness) to speak up from the back row of any congregation, any Friday night, or any Sunday morning, and say, "I had a Divinely inspired dream last night, and God told me to tell all of you...!" And with that, fueled by the undeniable authority of direct dream inspiration from God enshrined in Scripture, whatever "heresy" was spawned by last nights' dreams would be off and running, because no merely human authority in any merely local pulpit would be able to stand against it with equal force. </p>

<p>It is precisely because the scriptural authority of dream inspiration directly from God is so strong that in order to preserve what Presbyterians like to call "decency and good order", it has been seen as necessary, over and over again, in the history of institutional religious practice to disparage and marginalize dreamwork. </p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Jeremy Taylor</i></div>

<h3>The Brief Resurgence of Protestant Dreamwork</h3>

<p>At the end of the Middle Ages when the Protestant reformation rejected the traditional episcopal authority of the Bishop of Rome, there was a brief reassertion of seeking direct divine inspiration through dreams as the Bible suggests so clearly, but the various warring bands of Protestants soon discovered what the Roman Catholic predecessors had already learned - that dreams are the natural enemies of rigidity and dogma, and regular attention to dreams inevitably tends to undermine social arrangements that rely on and perpetuate dogmatic formulations of religious and spiritual truths. </p>

<p>Even when the original spiritual inspiration for a dogmatic formulation comes directly from compelling dreams and waking visions and directly reflects archetypes of the collective unconscious to begin with, subsequent dreams always continue to come in the service of even greater wholeness and spiritual vitality, inevitably pointing out ways in which the dogmatic formulation is prematurely closed and incomplete. </p>

<h3>The Archetype of "Willing Sacrifice"</h3>

<p>Like dreaming, the archetype of "Willing Sacrifice" is also found at the center of virtually all sacred narratives around the world. Christianity stands among the other world religions, not above them, in giving concrete historical and institutional religious shape to the archetype of "Willing Sacrifice". </p>

<p>From a psychological point of view, "Willing Sacrifice" also reveals the primary structure of the drama of evolution. It reflects the basic symbolic shape of the continuing growth and development of the drama of evolution. It reflects the basic symbolic shape of the continuing growth and development of human consciousness, both individual and collective. In order to go on growing and evolving, every person (and every society) must consciously and "willingly" relinquish the hard won achievements of self-image and self-awareness of past experience in order to be truly open to the possibilities of new life and evolving consciousness. </p>

<h3>Willing Sacrifice &amp; the Dilemmas of Parenthood</h3>

<p>One of the classic dilemmas of parenthood provides a clear example of the existential shape of this archetypal drama. It is generally understood that it is the job of a good parent to protect a young child from inappropriate and premature sexual knowledge and experience, but at some point, that same good parent must "reverse field" completely and provide and promote appropriate sexual information to the growing pre-adolescent whom the young child inevitably becomes. This necessary transformation of previous consciousness, self-definition, and behavior requires the parent to willingly and consciously give up specific ways of "being a good parent" to a small child, in order to cultivate new ideas and behaviors that reflect "being a good parent" to a pre adolescent.</p>

<p>Knowing exactly when this dramatic shift of archetypal parenting responsibilities is appropriate and necessary is one of the most poignant dilemmas and struggles of parenthood. It is also a moment that is always announced well in advance in the dreams of both parents and children. This is only one example of how cultivating the habit of family dream sharing can be one of the best and most easily available means of successfully overcoming miscommunication and lovingly bridging the "generation gap."</p>

<h3>Dreams, Willing Sacrifice, &amp; Individuation</h3>

<p>This is only one relatively clear example of the archetypal drama of "Willing Sacrifice" that repeats itself in symbolically similar ways, like an endless spiral, at each stage of developing psycho-spiritual maturity. Carl Jung called this universal process of human development "individuation". At each step of the way, previous achievements of self-awareness must be let go consciously in order for authentic growth and development to take place. The more conscious and self-aware one has become, the more conscious ("willing") this "letting go" (sacrifice) must be, each time it takes place. This is a process of metaphoric death and rebirth that leads to greater and greater psycho-spiritual maturity. Our dreams come regularly and give compelling symbolic and metaphoric shape to our interior psychospiritual unfoldment, and the ever expanding possibilities of communion with the Divine. No matter how complex and challenging their messages may be, we can not afford to ignore them.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6ctpuff-0.jpg" alt="Dragon" width="auto" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Any dream in the midst of which the dreamer has the clear thought, "Oh, I get it! This is a dream," is said to be "lucid". In a lucid dream, the dreamer recognizes the true nature of the experience as it is taking place. In the lucid dream state the" awakened" dreamer can generate amazing insights and release extraordinary creativity. Old habits can be transformed, creative energies can be mobilized and directed, problems can be solved and transcended, denials and repressions can be raised to consciousness and withdrawn, and confusing feelings, emotions and intuitions can be clarified and harmonized. </p>

<p>All of these marvelous things are also accomplished by remembering and working with ordinary, non-lucid dreams. fn lucid dreams, however, this healing work is sometimes woven dramatically into the dream itself, radically and "magically" extending the range and possibility of dreaming experience. </p>

<p>For example, a man (I will call him "Alex") dreamt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am fleeing from a firghtening, fiery dragon through a scorched and charred and still smouldering landscape. I run and run, until the magical moment of realization that this is all a dream! I suddenly "get it", that my terror and the pursuing monster and the whole scene are simply things that are happening in my dream. At that point, I turn and face the dragon and demand to know what he is doing in my dream.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>The fire-breathing dragon stops and replies telepathically "I am your smoking addiction!" As the monster 'speaks', I have an ironic appreciation of how ironic and even funny it is for my smoking addiction to appear in my dream as a "fire-breathing dragon".</em></p>
  
  <p><em>At that moment of lucid realization, the dragon suddenly seems to change. It doesn't really look any different, but its 'expression' seems to change. It isn't so scary any more.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>It begins to look winsome, almost charming – ‘Puff the magic dragon’ – more like a big, old familiar, friendly family dog than a menacing, deadly fire-breather.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>My lucidity allows me to look even more closely at the ‘transformed’ monster, and I see clearly that there is a nasty, sticky brown slime covering its entire body, and that noxious smoke is oozing and sputtering from every orifice, even from around its eyes, and from under and between its scales. I smell this awful, rancid, repulsive odor coming from it. My revulsion returns, and in the dream I look at it and say with all my heart, ‘Get away from me! I no longer want you in my life!’</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he awakened, Alex was amazed to discover that he no longer craved the sensation of smoke in his lungs. Perhaps even more importantly, the desire for the instant and reliable sense of "companionship" that smoking had always given him was also gone. He has not gone back to smoking since the dream. </p>

<p>By creating such a compelling image combining both the negative and positive elements of the addiction, his dream allowed Alex to recognize these previously unacknowledged dynamics with full <em>emotional</em> awareness. The "fire-breathing dragon" suddenly appears like a "big old familiar friendly family dog." Alex's decision, "I no longer want you in my life," was made in such a way that it "stuck". That is because it was made with full consciousness, directly in the face of the "old friend" with full emotional awareness of the "comfortable, reliable relationship" he was giving up. </p>

<p>As the dream symbolically depicts, a crucial part of Alex's addiction to cigarettes was emotional. It was centered in a preconscious fear of loneliness. One of the reasons that it had been so hard for him to quit prior to the dream was the illusion of control "lighting up" provided when feelings of loneliness appeared. His failure to consciously recognize and appreciate this dynamic component of his addiction also appears to have been the main stumbling block to "kicking the habit." Another implication of the lucid dream thought that the addiction is "like a .... family dog" is that his smoking habit may have been unconsciously fostered in his family of origin. During childhood, Alex may have been predisposed to smoke addictively by watching and being emotionally drawn into parental and sibling substance addictions and denials. In any case, the illusory emotional security that smoking provided had to be consciously <em>acknowledged</em> before it could be consciously <em>relinquished</em>. Without becoming conscious of these previously hidden emotional dynamics of the addiction, Alex's desire to be free of his noxious smoking habit could not lead to decisive action. </p>

<p>In my experience, such instances of spontaneous lucidity in dreams occur most often in association with corresponding moments of "lucidity" in waking life. When a person realizes that his or her true circumstances are in fact substantially different from what he or she had always supposed, then that person is likely to experience a spontaneous lucid dream. In such a dream, the true nature of the sleeper's experience-i.e. that it is really a dream-is consciously recognized in a way that reflects the sort of realization about what's really going on in waking life. Most often, this happens when a person withdraws a set of habitual projections in a waking-life situation.</p>

<p>An addiction is any habitual activity that insulates a person from full, conscious experience of his or her feelings and emotions. Addiction can involve various substances and emotional/sexual encounters, but for some people, prayer and good works also serve an addictive purpose. It doesn't matter what the activity is, only whether it functions to diminish the conscious impact of feelings and emotions. Dreams, because they come in the service of health and wholeness, point to the true addictive nature of even the most "laudable" behaviors when they serve this emotion-denying purpose. As Alex's dream suggests, dreams can also provide a venue for withdrawing denials and self-deceptions... and thus, for overcoming addictions.</p>

    ns1:description """<h3>1st Principle: There Is No Such Thing as a Bad Dream</h3>

<p>The most important thing that I have learned in the course of more than thirty years of professional work as a community organizer and dreamworker is that ALL dreams come in the service of health and wholeness and speak a universal language. Even the most terrible, gut-wrenching, heartstopping nightmares come to give us urgent warning that there is something going on that threatens our authentic lives. The nastier the experience of the nightmare is, the surer we can be that the warning it brings is urgent and important. If we remember the dream—and who can forget the worst nightmares? They force themselves onto our awareness whether we want to experience them or not—then the fact that the dream has been remembered at all means that we, the dreamers, have the ability to deal creatively and effectively with all the issues that the dream presents in symbolic form.</p>

<p>In other words, no dream—not even the worst nightmare—ever comes to anyone to say, "Nyeah, nyeah, you've got these problems and there's nothing you can do about them...!" If the nightmare is remembered, then the dreamer(s) can do something positive about all the issues that the dream(s) raise. This general truth about the symbolic, metaphoric world of dreams applies equally to our collective nightmares of history and current events, as well as to the more personal nightmares that disturb our individual sleep.</p>

<p>All nightmares, both individual and collective, present us with the ironic gift of forcing our attention to crucially important things in our lives that we have ignored or overlooked - things that threaten our individual and collective health, safety, and essential character.</p>

<h3>Nightmares &amp; the Nuclear Menace: A Case in Point</h3>

<p>Currently, Currently our attention has been focused on the collective nightmare of terrorism, particularly the terrorist attacks on America fueled by fanatical, Wahhabist Islamic fundamentalists. The possibility that Al Qaeda, or the Islamic Jihad, or any of a number of other fundamentalist terror organizations may gain possession of a nuclear device—perhaps a blackmarket bomb from the nuclear arsenal of the collapsed Soviet Union—makes the nightmare menace of terrorism even greater. The worldwide proliferation of nuclear technology makes the possibility—alas, the likelihood, of nuclear attack and/or nuclear industrial safety failure—either through terrorist sabotage or simple industrial planning error—an abiding and pervasive dread for us all.</p>

<p>The clearly demonstrated worldwide consequences of nuclear disaster, as the winds carry the lethal fallout around the globe, eventually spreading it from pole to pole, make the inescapable point: we are all equal, equally vulnerable and equally at risk... in the shadow of the radioactive cloud.</p>

<p>Ironically, in the short historical space of fifty-six years, the nightmare of nuclear menace has succeeded where four thousand years of religious and spiritual teaching and preachment have failed. It is now recognized as a concrete, hardheaded, inescapable truth: the people of the world are one folk. We are one family, sharing one house. What used to be seen as pious rhetoric and liberal wishful thinking has been transformed by the nightmare of nuclear menace into an inescapable reality that must be taken into account in all our strategizing and long range planning.</p>

<p>This is always the way nightmares deliver their paradoxical, coercive messages of health and wholeness, even as they point down the road to misery and death. The nightmares come to warn: "Do not continue down this path! You can see more clearly now where it inevitably leads...!"</p>

<h3>What Hidden Message of Health &amp; Wholeness Could Possibly Lie Hidden in the Terrorist Attacks?</h3>

<p>There is, I believe, a similar incongruous but crucially important message hidden in the horror on the September 11th terrorist attacks. For several generations there has been a growing sense in the West, and the world in general, that the acts of ordinary, anonymous, individuals are relatively insignificant, and that the economic and geopolitical forces that shape history are so vast and complicated that they are beyond our ability to comprehend, let alone our ability to shape and influence. The terror attacks of September 11th demonstrate beyond question that the acts of relatively ordinary and anonymous individuals <em>can</em> shape history - albeit in a horrifying, destructive way. The task that faces all of us now is to search out the corresponding creative and positive acts of courageous individuals that will serve as the counter-balance to the perverted ingenuity of the fanatical, suicidal hijackers.</p>

<p>Once again, paying attention to our own and others' dreams is the single best way I know to access and stimulate the archetypal creative impulse that resides in our unconscious depths. We human beings have blunderingly created this situation where suicidal fanaticism endangers the peace of the world; we can search into our unconscious depths to find the innovative and creative solutions to these problems as well.</p>

<h3>Unconscious Forces Influence &amp; Shape Our Conscious Actions</h3>

<p>The ways we respond to the major events of our lives—both personal and collective—are shaped by the symbolic quality of those events. We respond to happenings and events in the outer world with the same pent-up unconscious emotions and energies that are associated with our own personal lives and struggles... the very same emotions and energies that shape our dreams. To the extent that outer events— both joyous and tragic—evoke and share the symbolism of our own evolving, internal issues and dilemmas, we "see" those external events in a particular light and interpret their meaning in particular ways. This is the main reason why different people respond to the same or similar situations in different ways.</p>

<p>The issues and dramas that are working themselves out in both our individual and collective psyche are always reflected in our dreams, remembered from sleep. These interior dramas shape our waking world and to the extent that we are unconscious of their deeper meanings, we feel "trapped" and "helpless" in our waking lives. Our dreams give us an exquisite symbolic picture of what is going on inside and how this ongoing interior drama reflects and projects itself out into our waking opinions and actions. </p>

<p>Attention to our own and other peoples' dreams at times of national crisis can be particularly useful in bringing to light the unconscious emotions and energies that are distorting and twisting our waking perceptions and decisions. Because our unconscious feelings and ideas inevitably shape our waking attitudes and behaviors, we need to be as honest with ourselves as possible... particularly in these moments of national crisis.</p>

<p>If we are to make our way through the maze of conflicting emotions and harsh collective pressures to find some sort of real and productive response to this concerted attack on us and our way of life, we must look within at the very moment when the shouting crowds are demanding that we look only outside ourselves. The best way I know of to do this is to listen to the counsel of our own dreams, and listen with renewed attention to the dreams of others.</p>

<h3>Cherishing the Right &amp; Responsibility of Independent Thought</h3>

<p>It is often said that "the first casualty of war is the truth", but in fact, the first casualty is the easy ability to think, imagine, and act independently. These are the basic activities that form the foundation of democracy. American patriotism demands a great deal of us. True patriotism for Americans who believe in democracy and freedom demands of us that we continue looking within and thinking for ourselves, and that we demand that our elected leaders do better than make up "wars" that are essentially misguided and un-winnable.</p>

<p>We must demand that they do the difficult work of devising strategies to deal with the horrifying rise of organized crime fueled by religious fanaticism. The tired old plan to "kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out" simply will not work. We all must do better than that.</p>

<h3>The Spiritual Necessity for "Alchemy" in Our Lives &amp; in Our Dreams</h3>

<p>There are great dividends in paying attention to our dreams in periods of crisis such as we are currently experiencing. All such moments of crisis and stress call forth difficult spiritual questions from our depths. "How can an All-Powerful and All-Good God allow such evil horrors to happen?" is certainly one of them. Another one is: "How can I maintain a cheerful, active, creative belief in the inherent worth of the good and the just when evil, violence, and criminal stupidity seem so much more powerful than the gentle, intelligent truth?" </p>

<p>A universal, archetypal answer to these perennial psycho-spiritual questions has long been found in "alchemy". The great symbolic truth of alchemy is that "base matter" can (and must) be transmuted into "gold." In this archetypal symbol drama, "gold" is an image of deeply felt, reliable spiritual perspective, and "base matter" (often appearing literally in dreams as excrement or "shit"... the "worst" in ourselves) is an emblem of the worst things that we have ever experienced, either directly or vicariously. </p>

<p>It is precisely these "worst things" that must become the center of our psycho spiritual efforts to grow and mature. Unless we can develop spiritual understandings that deal adequately with finding meaning and spiritual communion in the midst of the worst things in our lives—individually and collectively — we will reach our death beds with the experience/ memory of the "worst things" in one hand, and a spiritual perspective carefully crafted to avoid the worst things in the other. And the only possible result of such an impasse, short of the operations of "grace," which is a very real force in the universe, and cannot be manipulated or predicted—is emptiness, misery, and despair.</p>

<p>We must face the worst things with clear consciousness, and in that encounter bring the inherent, archetypal potential for psycho-spiritual transformation into waking reality. When a person dreams of "shit," it is most often an indication that he/she is being forced to relinquish the illusory comforts of denial and self deception in waking life. Being forced to admit consciously just how bad things really are is never pleasant in the short run (just as the archetypal "shit dreams" are almost never pleasant), but in the longer run, giving up denial, facing and dealing with the "shit" of our lives as it actually is, is exactly what the dreamer has to do in order to forge an adequate spiritual perspective. </p>

<p>The ongoing fundamentalist/terrorist attack on the West in general and the United States of America in particular is certainly at the top of the list of "worst things" that we must come to grips with these days. Hopefully, we can do this without losing our tenderest and best energies and possibilities. Our dreams are working overtime to wrestle with this "alchemical" question.</p>

<h3>A Transformative, Archetypal, Alchemical Dream</h3>

<p>The night of the terrible attacks of September 11th, a young woman of my acquaintance who was visiting in New York City at the time—and who stood that day, watching the World Trade Center collapse and burn, not knowing if her childhood friend who worked on the 32nd floor of Tower Two had escaped or not — had a dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I find myself in the midst of forest that has been clearcut... nothing but great big stumps in all directions as far as I can see. I am devastated. I am weeping. I walk through the destroyed landscape asking myself, "Who could DO such a thing?" Then I am drawn to stop and look at the spiral pattern in one of the stumps. I realize how very old this forest was and it makes me even more filled with grief at the loss of this beautiful old forest. Then I begin to be drawn down into the spiral. As I sink down into the spiral and into myself, I realize that this is a part of the tree that I almost never get to see. I am drawn more and more deeply into the spiral... down into a place of myself that is so wise, and calm, and deep that it is simply greater than my intense grief and the horror.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“There is more, but I can't remember any more than that... . I awakened from the dream with a sense of calmness and clarity that allowed me to get through the next day, even with all my friends freaking out..." </p>

<p>My in-box has been filled to the brim since September 11th with accounts of precognitive dreams "predicting" the terrorist attacks. With all of those fascinating dreams, this young woman's dream remains the most interesting and compelling dream I have heard thus far related to the terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat to our collective way of life. It is an "alchemical dream". It turns the worst thing into an occasion for communion with the Divine; it "turns the shit into gold" before our very eyes as we imagine it. It is such a startling dream because it makes it clear that the (archetypal) spiral of the growth rings that serves as a pathway to the perception of the deepest truth and beauty would not be visible if the tree had not been cut down. </p>

<p>At one level, it is a metaphor of doing the psychospiritual work necessary to be a person in whom such a metaphor of healing can rise to consciousness. At another level, it also implies that this experience of the Divine is possible by looking at the "spiral" revealed in the stumps of any of the clear-cut trees. This is not just an exclusive, personal revelation; it is a metaphor of collective transformation of feeling and understanding, potentially available to all. </p>

<p>This dream is a concrete example of the psychospiritual truth that it is often through our worst wounds and injuries, both individual and collective, that we are opened to the archetypal possibilities of healing, and of more direct communion with the Divine. One does not have to be wounded to be opened to these energies of transcendence, but for those of us who are deeply injured by life, our anguish itself opens us to these profound possibilities. </p>

<p>My personal conviction, born of more than thirty years of experience doing dreamwork, is that no dreamer would be able to remember such a dream if he/she had not done the requisite personal, interior, psycho-spiritual work to discover and awaken those same archetypal healing energies within. The metaphor the dream offers is so simple, so lucidly clear, even a small child could grasp the paradox without difficulty: the very thing that caused the horror—cutting down the beautiful old forest—is what makes this particular pathway to the experience of the Divine open up and become available. </p>

<p>This is a potentially healing and transformative dream for all of us. May we each find our way to the recovery and reconciliation promised and implied by our own ability to imagine this dream for ourselves... if only for a moment. Let us all continue to dream our lives forward into the uncertain future with all the courage and creativity that is our birthright, both as Americans born to freedom, and as human beings living together as best we can in the one tragically beautiful world we all share. </p>

<p><em>“Prophet’s Dance” by Orna Ben-Shoshan</em></p>

<p>This painting was featured on the cover of Volume 28, #2-3 of the Dream Network Journal.</p>

<p>In Biblical times, prophets would engage themselves in ecstatic rituals and open themselves to absorb divine messages (prophecies). In order to be enthused by the spirit of prophecy, all external garments are shed away, all the inhibitions and restrictions put away, and the prophet’s spirit exposes itself open and receptive.</p>

<p>The painting “Prophets’ Dance” illustrates such ritual. The figures shed away their gowns to find out that their bodies are light and lucent – all external overlays melt away, and their core essence is revealed. A circle made of stones symbolizes their concealed zone, and hints that they are immersed in their internal world while dancing.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced such a state in your life? Was it at a time of complete openness to someone or something that you truly desired to contain? Indeed, being mentally uncovered and so vulnerable is a risky business for most people. But remember, that the gentle rays of light cannot penetrate heavy curtains.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;font-style: italic;font-size: 0.9em;"><span>'Chart the Growth' (detail), by Brenda Ferrimani</span></div>

<p>The Dream Network began life in New York City in 1982, edited by the young <a href="../@billstimson">Bill Stimson</a>. The Network aimed to 'bring dreams back to dreamers' - or as <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> phrased the idea in one of his early contributions, 'Giving dreams back to the people'. </p>

<p>While the ideas of great dream theorists have been avidly studied in these pages, the final authority on the meaning and importance of dreams always lies with the individual dreamer. The dream has always been regarded as a tool for personal liberation, an object of aesthetic and ecstatic admiration as well as scientific study.</p>

<p>This has meant an eclectic publication that mixed articles with poetry and art, quantitative analysis with personal reflections, and included contributions by professionals and enthusiasts alike. The Network nurtured a network of dreamers and dream groups, a 'dream cherishing culture'. </p>

<p>The Dream Network Journal ceased publication at the end of 2015, but in 2019 <a href="https://twitter.com/kannydennedy">Dan Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://eastwest.works/Inoshi.html">Inoshi Denizen</a> teamed up with <a href="../@robertaossana">Roberta Ossana</a>, the journal's editor of 27 years, to bring the wisdom of the journal back to dreamers again. Thanks to our <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/dream-network-journal">crowdfunding backers</a>, this website allows you to download every issue ever published, and read many articles in blog form. </p>

<p>This is tentatively an 'archive' site of the journal, but we'd also like to experiment with something a bit more <em>living</em>. As of now, if you have any articles you'd like to contribute, please let us know! We will send out a digest to subscribers of the newsletter (signup link in the menu above). </p>

<p>You can contact us at: <a href="mailto:hello@dreamnetworkjournal.com">hello@dreamnetworkjournal.com</a></p>

<h2>A brief history of the Dream Network</h2>

<p>Here's how <a href="../@robertaossana">Roberta Ossana</a> has described some of the journal's history: </p>

<p>"The Dream Network was first published as a Bulletin and appeared in print through the determination of a very fiery and compassionate young man by the name of <a href="../@billstimson">William (Bill) Stimson</a>. I wrote Bill—who has become a cherished friend—and asked him if he'd be willing to share a few words. Bill's statement is the essence, the Spirit, that guides the Dream Network:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Dream Network is not the publication; the enterprise proper isn't a publishing one. To speak the truth of what the Dream Network is about for us is to find our myth, and where else but among our dreams? It is for us to use our dreams in a way that enables us to come together honestly and deeply, for what was broken to be rendered whole again; our community with one another, our connection with our deeper selves, our oneness in purpose, our ability and our resolve to embody the Light itself. What makes the Dream Network special is that it is fundamentally different. People sense this somehow and so they've helped the energy and unfoldment move forward."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During Bill's time, there were other dream-inspired publications coming out in different parts of the country that were Dream Network affiliate publications. One of them was called Fusion. I believe it came out of Seattle. There was another called DreamCraft, which came out of the northeast. There was apparently a big stir of energy happening at the time which has been growing ever since.</p>

<p>Barbara Shor (now departed)—who was a very good friend and part of the original New York dream community generated by Bill Stimson—had this to say about Bill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In my mind's eye is Bill Stimson's small, walk-up flat on a hot summer's night... the beginnings of the New York dream community. We never formed a tight-knit group because the people kept changing too often for that. The room was usually crowded...15 to 20 people. Essentially, we knew nothing about dreams, but Bill's enthusiasm and passion for dreams was contagious!</p>
  
  <p>It was a dream whose time had come, like the classic dream of finding yourself in your own home but entering a new room that you've never been in before. We were electrified! This group was the core of the New York dream community and the New York dream community was the core of the early dream movement in the United States. Although we couldn't articulate it at the time, I think we realized that we now had a mission in life. We were converts to dreams. Was it Bill's vision of a global network of dreamers we were envisioning or did it arise spontaneously among us? I don't know, but it was powerful. When Bill got an idea, he didn't rest until he got it out there. He was the prototype of the populist networker, the Trotsky of the dream revolution. It might have happened without him, but it never would have been so fast, so intense, so like a prairie fire in a season of drought. Maybe this was the next step after the revolutionary 60's. That world-changing vision hadn't fully worked, so maybe we had to go back to the inner drawing board, and remake the world from the individual psyche's infrastructure inside out, instead of the other way around."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill created and published the Dream Network Bulletin for approximately two years: a 4-8 page publication which came out monthly. Then it came into the hands and heart of <a href="../@chrishudson">Chris Hudson</a>.</p>

<p>Chris and his wife <a href="../@dalegottlieb">Dale</a> moved to Brooklyn from rural New Hampshire after they got married in 1982 at Windows On the World, top of the World Trade Center, on Sept. 11, 1982. Dale was from Brooklyn and he promised her some "city time." Having been a ‘country boy,’ he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I shortly went nuts and found out about the Brooklyn Dream Community and also the Manhattan Dream Community, where I met Bill Stimson and we attended a weekend leadership training workshop at Monte Ullman's north of the city. Bill was despairing of the Dream Network at the time and wanted to hand it to someone else, so I took responsibility for the publication for a couple of years. I've led dream groups and also studied psychology but dumped the professional side to help Dale w/our kids. I like the term, ‘amateur psychologist.’</p>
  
  <p>“I believe that the unconscious is God and that dreams are the best path to understanding God within and the interconnectedness of all people. Creativity is the blood of God and dreams are nothing if not creative, always in the service of self-awareness, not always comfortably but always accurately.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris was in Brooklyn when <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a> and <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Bob Van De Castle</a> took responsibility for the publication next, in Virginia Beach, Virginia (approx. 1985. I'm not aware of the dynamics that occurred when the publication was making its moves around the country in its early years, but Henry and Bob have shared that even before the Dream Network appeared on the scene, Henry had published several issues of the "Sundance Community Dream Journal," the precursor to the Dream Network Journal and the first published journal declaring that dreams belong to dreamers. The Sundance Journal and Henry's early efforts have had him dubbed "The Father of the American Dream Movement" in many circles. </p>

<p>In approximately 1987, the Dream Network traveled into the hands and heart of <a href="@caseyflyer">Linda Magallón</a>, San Jose, CA.—who had a great deal of support from <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a> and <a href="../@jillgregory">Jill Gregory</a>. Linda had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dream Network is a communal project. It couldn't happen without the help of family, friends, and colleagues, without the assistance of volunteers, contributors, and subscribers. Under my tutelage, the most important goal was to assure that new voices would be heard, new visions seen, especially those dreamers who'd not been previously published. They were nurtured and encouraged to dare to dream in the public forum."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In June 1989, literally on summer solstice, I was informed that the Bay Area Dream Workers had accepted my offer to take responsibility for the publication. I KNEW at that moment, how a butterfly feels coming out of its cocoon!"</p>

<p><em>Roberta stewarded the Network masterfully from 1989 to 2015. In her time she moved from a 24 to 52-page publication, with each issue focused on a central theme. She developed a council of advisors for the journal, and started publishing the journal in PDF form online.</em></p>

<p>Haiku originated in thirteenth century Japan. From its inception, the goal of haiku has been to create a connection with the natural world. That deep relationship to nature has lead many to describe haiku as a spiritual path. Usually, each haiku establishes a sense of season in collaboration with another image to stir the feelings and the imagination of the reader. </p>

<p>Like dreamwork, haiku is a vehicle for spiritual insight. It frames the experience of one insightful moment in a single breath. The world of the senses unites with the world of nature in haiku, as an offering from the heart. </p>

<p>The language of haiku is condensed, distilling a powerful experience into just three lines. As in dreamwork, haiku is written in the present tense. The flow of consciousness in haiku and dreams is not necessarily logical or linear. The intelligence that governs both is that of intuition. </p>

<p>As the most concentrated, shortest form of poetry, the focus of haiku is on images. Like dreamwork, haiku imagery has many layers and is multi-sensory. The symbolic value of the image enables the haiku poet to share a moment that was deeply touching with brevity. </p>

<p>Just as you can invite dream imagery to play in your conscious mind all day, haiku can be explored in a similar manner. If you approach each haiku in a relaxed state by dropping into your own breath and releasing distractions, you can open your heart and engage your active imagination. Experiment with reading a poem silently first, then out loud a couple of times. This approach enables you to cross the threshold of consciousness and to embrace the images as they appear in your mind’s eye. Try not to analyze the poem. Just let the first two lines create their impression, while the third sometimes offers an insight or a surprise. Then, if you choose, you can take that haiku with you and mull over the images throughout the day. Enjoy the journey!</p>

<p>Can life exist in other forms besides the one we live in? Can we access such realms? Can anyone see them? </p>

<p>The art world, especially the surreal, visionary and fantasy genres, suggest a glimpse into the vast range of possibilities that exist beyond normal human perception. </p>

<h2>Worlds Far Out</h2>

<p>The ongoing desire to discover an alternate fantastic reality, which is perfect and free of the limitations of time-space, begins in many people’s childhood. As children, we were often curious about who we are, and what this life is all about. In many cases, the death of a person we knew raised many questions about the after-life. The gnosis about existence of realms beyond is imprinted in the human collective experience. There is a vague memory in every individual’s mind regarding other dimensions of existence. </p>

<p>Where did we come from and what is the purpose of this life? This question is often asked by humans of all ages. Did we come to this world from another realm? Can life exist in other forms besides the one we live in? Can we access such realms? Can anyone see them? In the second half of the 20th century, modern science developed new tools to explain the existence of life in more than one dimension. According to the “String Theory,” the universe is spread in ten different dimensions consisting of varying energy vibrations and the universal energy field is composed of “membranes” and other esoteric shapes. </p>

<h2>The Realm of Matter</h2>

<p>All that exists, seen or unseen, is an infinite field of being composed of one dimensional strings that vibrate in an infinite spectrum of frequencies. The infinite energy field contains all that there is, it is the source where all forms of life exist. At the lowest range of this wide ray of frequencies, there is a “thickening” of energy fields. The lowest frequencies which crystallize into matter, are known to us as the “physical” world (dimension), which is measurable and can be recognized by our 5 senses. All other forms of life, which vibrate in higher frequencies that are beyond human perception, create the parallel realities of other realms. Scientists assume that parallel realities were created by the “missing” 80% of the mass released after the “Big Bang.” This mass was transformed into energy fields that compose the other dimensions. Different theories suggest that we exist in the 3rd dimension (out of 10). This is the most condensed energy field which enables the formation of matter. Other dimensions contain different forms of life, with different levels of consciousness in different frequencies. All the physical attributes known to us as our physical world— such as electro-magnetic fields, gravitation, and nuclear energy—are singular manifestations of the universal energy. </p>

<h2>The Kabbalistic Outlook</h2>

<p>According to the mystical Kabbalah, which investigates universal secrets and the essence of life, we can learn that the reality we are aware of represents a tiny section of the whole. The Kabbalah indicates that the larger part of existence—the dimensions that we cannot perceive with our human limitations—is indeed the reality itself and our physical life is just an illusion. The Kabbalistic “Ten Sefirot”—or Ten Spheres—is a clear manifestation of the ten dimensions of the universe. The nine higher spheres existed before our physical world was formed. The highest sphere is “Keter” (Crown), a dimension of eternal light, the source of everything created, a dimension with no limitations. The following eight spheres are stemmed out of the highest sphere and actualize their previous sphere as their energetic consistency becomes more and more condensed. The energetic volume of every sphere is one tenth of its previous sphere. The world in which we live is the sphere named “Malchut,” (kingdom), the realm of matter. </p>

<h2>The Scientific Perspective</h2>

<p>The theory of parallel dimensions was first contemplated by scientists at Princeton University. A recent research by Prof. David Dutch of Oxford University has proven the theory of parallel worlds. He claims that we can only see a minimal portion of the large reality. Our world is only one of many possible hidden realities, only one single form of existence out of infinite dimensions that exist at the same time. According to quantum physics, there is more than one universe, and we can interact with alternate dimensions of being. </p>

<p>Parallel realities may exist by different physical laws of time and space. Their transpirings can be manifestations of another set of possibilities that are alternative to the occurrences we witness in our own reality. They may be happening just a few millimeters away from us, but we cannot be aware of them because their energetic frequencies are unperceived by us. </p>

<h2>Accessing Alternate Dimensions</h2>

<p>The human soul, which is an integral part of the immense universal energy field, has a subconscious connection with different forms of being. As humans, we are “trapped” in a physical body that limits our large vision of the universe. Consciously, we can only be aware of aspects that can be absorbed by our five senses. People who develop their sixth sense can access knowledge which is beyond the physical existence. </p>

<p>According to modern physics, the passage between our dimension and parallel realities is in the form of “black holes” or “worm tunnels” that exist in some mysterious locations in the universe. Mankind has vague memories (or traces of memories) of other existing dimensions, and there is an ongoing quest to overcome the limitations of the mind and access the larger picture. </p>

<h2>Humans are able to connect with alternate realities in some conditions</h2>

<p>As our souls leave our bodies during sleep, they can access higher realms and get recharged and reset. According to the Kabbalah, the sleep process is considered as some form of death, when the soul departs from the body. Practicing Jews have a special morning prayer to thank God for returning the soul back into the body upon awakening. </p>

<p>In deep trance meditation, people can silence their ever active minds and connect with the eternal universal love energy. Psychics and metaphysical practitioners whose sixth sense is developed can access knowledge through deep trance as well. At death, the spirit leaves the physical body and moves on to a higher level of consciousness, which is limitless. In fact, this is the ultimate transformation into another dimension—a total change of form. For most people, reading fantasy literature or watching science fiction movies may open their imagination to ideas and possibilities which are beyond “normal” existence. </p>

<h2>Where Can You See Parallel Worlds?</h2>

<p>Art is the answer. Surreal art is characterized by images that come directly from the subconscious mind. As known in metaphysics, the subconscious mind is the medium through which our souls are connected to universal wisdom. Universal wisdom is an infinite pool that contains all information and endless possibilities, as in the Akashic Records. </p>

<p>The art world—especially the surreal, visionary and fantasy genres— suggests a glimpse into the vast range of possibilities that exist beyond normal, human perception. Some surrealist artists are, in fact, clairvoyants who absorb images from alternate forms of reality. According to social perception, they “capture” visuals through channeling. </p>

<h2>The Artistic Simulation</h2>

<p>Look at Salvador Dali’s paintings <em>“The Dream”</em> and <em>“The Temptation of St. Anthony.”</em> What if his vivid surreal imagination describes an alternate reality where such scenes take place? Rene Magritte’s painting <em>“The Human Condition”</em> is a clear illustration where one plane (the image on the canvas) merges with another (the actual landscape in the back). Magritte’s famous <em>“Chateau des Pyrenees”</em> depicts a huge rock floating over the ocean, with a castle built on top. </p>

<p>Well – everybody knows that a huge boulder cannot float in the air but can this scene possibly be in a dimension that has a different set of physical laws? </p>

<p>Remedios Varo, a Mexican surrealist, is a terrific example of a clairvoyant artist. Her paintings depict a series of fantasy scenes that seem to be taken from alternate worlds. Look at her painting <em>“The Alchemist”</em> and see reality extending from one dimension to another. </p>

<h2>Dreams and Alternate Realities</h2>

<p>The mystical Kabbala sees the dreaming process as the separation of the soul from the body during sleep. The only thread that keeps the soul linked to the body is the mental aspect of a human. </p>

<p>As the soul is free from physical restrictions during sleep, it can visit realms that are far out of the earthly dimension to which we are bound during the waking hours. Dreams are experiences that the soul collects during its visit in the “worlds beyond”. Since there are endless realms that exist simultaneously with our physical reality, the spirit, which is an energy body, is drawn there. Dreams do open the gate to alternate realities. </p>

<p>In many cases, the conscious mind cannot comprehend these experiences; therefore, it is not able to remember them when waking up. You may see it as if the mind is “speechless” about where the soul has visited in the dream. </p>

<p>I consider myself a member of this group of artists. I am a self-taught visionary artist. My paintings originate from a mysterious, far-out world and reveal colorful esoteric occurrences, in which creatures and objects interact in unpredictable ways. The metaphysical atmosphere in my creations draw the viewer into a journey through alternative realities. As a life-long student of Kabbalah and mysticism, I have always been fascinated with the gateway points—the borders between different dimensions. My artwork reflects a wide range of potentials, as I explore the different aspects of transformation from one form of existence to another. </p>

<p>Here are a few examples that illustrate my inductions: </p>

<p>In my painting <em>“Shedding Heavy Traces”</em>, two figures are carrying a person whose upper body emerges from an open carrier. The person is on his way “out” of this world, on the verge of leaving this realm of existence (death) and progressing into another dimension. His lower body has already disappeared into what can be interpreted as “nothingness.” On his departure he drops away heavy packages that symbolize the material load he had to carry throughout his life in the physical realm. The painting “Four Twin Souls” depicts four figures, that exist in one dimension who are being spiritually fed by their clone entities that live in another dimension. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6ghelev-1.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>My painting <em>“Departure”</em> shows a woman carrying a pod, approaching a staircase through which she will embark on her travel into another dimension. The angel at the top of the staircase unveils the passage to her. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6ghelev-2.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"/></p>

<p><em>“The Elevator”</em> shows two figures carried in a wooden box over a hallucinated plane. Their faces are covered so that they can’t see the journey’s track. A winged figure carries the cargo through air. This is a scene that deals with metaphysical transformation – as the passengers in the box are being moved from one level of consciousness to the other. Traveling through air, diffusing from one plane into another, riding a floating structure, opening a door to the void, climbing a staircase, or dissolving landscapes - there are many possible ways shown by art as a means to pass into alternate dimensions. If you are curious about the worlds beyond, this is the place to see them. </p>

<p>As the human memories of parallel life forms fade when a soul is reincarnated into a new physical body, glimpses of memory may appear in our minds time and again for a fraction of a second. Capture these visions! These moments of enlightenment come to remind us that our earthly life is just one of infinite possibilities in the mighty universe that created us.</p>

<p>A whisper of healing wisdom is woven throughout this compelling and often frightful story of a contemporary woman. Our author has made our protagonist so likeable and identifiable, that the reader easily adopts her as a friend that most can relate to. It is hard to leave this book set aside on the table as her life becomes gripping and curiously mysterious.</p>

<p>Kate, the main character, deals with horrific challenges planted in her life from the day of her birth. This story allows us to share with her the wounding that many women are haunted by in a family with mental illness. Kate suffered early abuse and, insidiously the trauma entangled itself in the precious unfolding of all her life’s evolution. In so many invisible ways, the wounding constantly twists and strangles the true essence of a tiny child, a little girl, a young woman learning about love and intimacy, and then a wise being expanding into her vast spirituality.</p>

<p>And yet she lives her story with others as so many of us do. She manifests her incredible talents and gifts and her delightful personality with close friends as her secrets lie deeply buried but haunting her dreams, fantasies and perceptions. Through her, whether we too were horrifically abused or maybe scarred by the misogynistic dark cloud that all women in our world must struggle through, Kate teaches us all about the profound damage trauma and abuse causes. And we also are in awe at the great gifts that spring into being as one finds resolution through exploration and seeing clearly who we are. Kate models a courageous willingness to see the great self that is light and the traumatized self that was locked away in the dark and then liberated.</p>

<p>For all men and women alike, this story educates and stirs us all awake out of our unique darkness and into our light.</p>

<p>All the way through, this is an entertaining and engrossing story but - not to be a spoiler - there is a delightful surprise ending that is a great gift of liberation.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Symbolic Sound Forms from the Akashic Records</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Roberta Ossana (DNJ):</strong> Dr. Bonnell, Thank you for being willing to share your unique gift and perspectives with our readers. By way of introduction, will you please share a bit of your background? How did you come to be an Akashic record reader? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> I began my journey into the Akasha as a child of eight. This actually came about as a result of a severe beating given me by my stepfather. I was knocked out-of-body. This experience (OBE) seems to have facilitated my ability to do so at will and I found it to be so delightful that I repeated it the next day. Thereafter, after school I would go immediately to my room, close the door and go out to my special place. About a year into this activity I met a guide by the name of E-Ly. He took me into the Akasha, or Great Hall of Records. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How would you define or describe the Akashic records? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> E-Ly helped me understand the nature of the Records by way of taking me back to when the Records were first formed by the originating Twelve Logos as a means of communicating their unique frames of reference regarding Creation in this realm without bias. As these original Souls began begetting, each subsequent Soul added their knowing to the web of energy spiraling around Earth. Eventually the concept of time was added as a means of self-discovery within the maze, or the dimensional layers of consciousness we call our reality. It was then that the need for an oversoul, a point of integration of all knowing, was added to the equation, thus creating the need to individuate self into linear formats to satisfy a progression through the maze. It is said that the Records contain all that is or ever will be, including information from all of world incarnations of individual beings.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> In your book, you speak of consciousness and evolutionary cycles, in particular the 13,000 year cycles that swings on a continuum/pendulum from Duality to Unity. The Records indicate that we are on the threshold of completing a 13,000 year cycle of duality that began with the demise of Lemuria and Atlantis... and we are now entering into a cycle of Unity that will be initiated by an Event: The Twelve Days of Light. Would you summarize this Event and its implications for the Earth and humanity? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> There are rings of energy constantly emanating from the center of Creation. If we were to look back over time to the rise and fall of civilizations we could get a fairly good idea of the intensity and duration of past waves. This current wave began to overtake us some five hundred years ago. At the center of each of these waves, no matter how long in duration, there is a period of great intensity. Every 13,000 years, a wave one thousand years thick in duration overtakes us. We are quickly coming to the center of this current wave (seventh month of 2001) and will feel an intensity event for twelve consecutive days. This event is the line in the sand between the Aquarian and Piscean ages. We, the whole of mankind, will move into a unification of body, mind and Spirit similar to that experienced during the end time of Lemuria and the height of the Atlantian period. This move from separation into Unity will be experienced by everyone, regardless of the level of preparedness. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You have sited Old Testament prophets (Isaiah and Ezekiel), prophecies of the Hopi and Mayan people and those of noted prophets like Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce . Information from these various sources seem to corro-borate that which you have glean-ed from individual readings and questions you have posed directly to the Records . Most prophets and prophecies, however, tend to focus on apocalyptic and/or negative 'endtime' scenarios. The Records indicate a place 'Beyond the Veil'-The Fifth Dimension-the ushering in of the long-awaited Age of Aquarius. What is the Light you have seen beyond the end of this present day tunnel of chaos and approximately when will we arrive there? </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> Timing of this event is the single most difficult aspect of this prophecy. It has been said that only God knows when. But then if everything is God ... we know. The difficulty is in how time is determined on the other side, i.e. you have to break cosmic references into Earthly equivalents. Not as easy as it may sound. </p>

<p>This is where the Old Testament and ancient text stuff comes into play. As best as can be interpreted the exact timing of this event is around the 17th of July 2001 with the collective mind stepping beyond the boundary of time in the year 2011. The Light at the end of the tunnel is full realization afforded us by this current wave. The timing is immediate. The good news is, every lifetime you have had since the last shift in Atlantis has been the preparation for this event. You will not be left behind again. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Do you perceive that we often enter the realm of the Akashic records in the dream state? Could you give an example, please. </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> The Akashic Records are our collective gathering of data that is freely shared without bias or prejudice. Because most of us have very strong waking opinions about what is right and wrong, we are kept from consciously entering the Records . The only other primary entrance is through our unconscious state, or dream consciousness. We all get data through intuition and hunches. But these are little snippets. Dreams are whole volumes of data that pertain directly to our concerns of the waking world, mainly our perceptions of how others view our contributions. This is the human predicament: how others perceive us. Not if we are clear and lucid about our place in Creation, but how others perceive our place. Dreams are extremely important streams of data that communicate the most direct path to our self dis-covery. The data released in streams of consciousness during the dream state are from an indi-vidual's personal Book of Life held with the Akashic Records. Because of this, dreams are very important. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You stress throughout the book that our work Now is the release of conflict and that since profound conflict is the current state of the collective mind, conflict itself will self destruct. This sounds like Chaos Theory in its finest hour! Is this (release of conflict) in your opinion <em>The</em> work we need to do, individually, in 'Preparing' Soul &amp; Spirit for the Millennium? Please elaborate and provide, if you will, a Vision of how it will be for those who sustain consciousness. </p>

<p><strong>Gary Bonnell:</strong> As we get closer to this cosmic line in the sand between ages, we will see a dramatic increase in collective conflict. This will act out in some very bizarre struggles as individuals, groups and cultures let go of the need to be right about their beliefs. The more individuals who are aware of the need to let go of conflict, the smoother the transition from third and fourth-dimensional awareness to third, fourth and fifthdimensional awareness. It is up to the individuals within the context of their like-mindedness to let go and let God. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Thank you, Dr. Bonnell, for sharing with us!</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10853175-dream-life-wake-life">Dream Life, Wake Life: The Human Condition Through Dreams</a>, by Gordon Globus, MD, State University of New York Press (1987), 187 pages.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>How do we create the life-worlds we experience every night in our dreams? Are these life-worlds mere patch-works of waking memories, or are they wholly original productions of our innate creativity? What is the relation of our dream creativity to our waking life creativity? These are some of the central questions Gordon Globus addresses in his fascinating study of dreams. </p>

<p>Globus, a Professor of Psychiatry and Philosophy at the University of California at Irvine, takes on some of the most complex, and perhaps also the most neglected, theories on dreams and dreaming in his quest to discover the nature of dreaming creativity. For example, he struggles with D. Foulkes' cognitive psychological approach to dreaming, A. Rechtschaffen's psycho-physiological research, and M. Boss' therapeutic use of dreams in his "Daseinanalysis." Globus makes a good case for why anyone seeking full understanding of the nature of dreams needs to take account of such material. </p>

<p>But despite his persuasive arguments, Globus' book is not easily read. Along with these dense technical theories Globus also discusses mind-numbing subjects like Heideggerian existentialism, the "phenomenological epoche" of Husserl, and Leibniz's monadological idealism (I'll confess that more than once I skipped through such passages to the helpful summaries Globus sets at the end of each section). All of this is expressed in a style so extremely formal and concise that sometimes reading the book is like wading through steel. Fortunately Globus balances this by injecting a nice personal element into the book. He recounts three dreams of his own, one an especially poignant dream about his wife's cancer. </p>

<p>Despite all the intimidating scholarship, Globus does have an important point to make here, one worth our attention. Against Freud, Foulkes, etc., he argues that dreams are not simply built up out of memory traces and images, like a mason using pre-made bricks to build a wall. Globus claims that dreams reflect a "formative creativity" by which we wholly and spontaneously produce the life-world of our dreams. In our dreams we have "the capacity for infinite creativity," which he says "is the power of the Godhead." The main thesis of Globus' work is that the same formative creativity we find in our dream life we also find in our wake life.</p>

<p>This is a notion with which many of us (especially lucid dreamers) already have some familiarity based on our own experiences. We've discovered deep resources of creativity in our dreams which may come to have transformative powers in waking life. Globus' achievement is that he has grounded this concept of formative creativity, of the practically infinite wells of creativity in our dream life, in a solid philosophical and psychological structure. More generally, he has shown how bridging the gaps between the various realms of dream study and research can produce some truly new and valuable insights.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It is one of our society's greatest delusions that we believe each of us exists as a separate, independent being. Modern Westerners tend to see sharp, clear cut boundaries between our individual selves and the rest of the world. Our independence, we assume, is the <em>primary</em> fact of our existence. As a result, we see our relationships as <em>secondary</em>: relationships may be important, but our individuality is our real, true essence. We believe we are all Robinson Crusoes, little islands unto ourselves, entirely self-sufficient, dependent on no one. </p>

<p>This delusion has been challenged by many different critics in recent years (e.g., by feminists, theologians, developmental psychologists, and Marxian social theorists). The common theme in these challenges is that humans are essentially <em>relational</em> beings: we exist in relationships, our very being is a product of our relationships. The Robinson Crusoe fantasy blinds us to the fact that we are "always already" in relationships-with our families, our communities, the environment, the cosmos. </p>

<p>Such blindness can be very destructive, for it leads us to ignore or deny the effects of our actions on others and to proudly exaggerate our own individual powers. But, delusions die hard, if they die at all. Our society's cherished belief in the self-sufficient, <em>non</em>-relational individual is as strong as ever and may well be getting stronger.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>In the midst of this conflict between such titanic social forces, what role can dreams play? As the books being reviewed here beautifully demonstrate, dreams have a very valuable role to play in this conflict. One of the many discoveries we make in our dreams is how deeply embedded we are in a whole range of relationships (this discovery goes as far back as Freud; for all his other problems, he did demonstrate that at one level our dreams reveal the profound importance of our relationships with our families). Dreams reveal to us the nature of our relationships, their problems and their potentials; dreams help us see where our relationships are stuck, where they are strong, and where they can be transformed. </p>

<p>Each of the following books discusses an important kind of relationship and how dreams give us valuable insights into it. Alan Siegel's book, <strong><em>Turning Point Dreams</em></strong> (Los Angeles: Jeremy Tarcher, 1990; 306 pp.), helps us see how dreams speak to our <em>personal</em> relationships-to our relationships with our spouses, parents, children, friends, and coworkers. Siegel focuses on how our relationships are transformed at certain "turning points" in our life. In his many years of psychotherapy practice, Siegel has found that our dreams respond to such turning points with powerful, extremely valuable images and energies. He says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A turning point or period of stress is an ideal time to develop confidence in exploring your dreams, because the manifest content and underlying meanings are usually closely related to the emotional challenges you are facing." (p. 11) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Turning Point Dreams</em> has chapters devoted to the value of dreams in dealing with marriage, pregnancy and the birth of a child, problems with work, divorce and separation, and the death of loved ones. Each chapter discusses a kind of personal relationship that has reached a time of fundamental change, a "turning point," and Siegel shows how dreams can help us respond to those changes as creatively as we can. </p>

<p>Siegel has a very good awareness of current dream ·research and he uses that research to enrich his practical advice. Too often, academic dream researchers and practice-oriented dream explorers are not aware of each other's findings. </p>

<p>Siegel has worked hard to integrate the theoretical and the practical realms of dream study, and his book greatly benefits from the effort. <em>Turning Point Dreams</em> is one of the very best general audience books on dreams to appear in recent years, and I <em>highly</em> recommend it. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6glorev-0.jpg" width="350px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Charles De Beer's book, <strong><em>Dreams: Allegorical Stories of Mystic Import</em></strong> (Umtentweni, South Africa: 1990; 228 pp.), addresses our relationship with the divine-with the soul, the Higher Self, God, however different people and different cultures have described those powers. De Beer is a dream explorer from South Africa who has devoted years to probing the spiritual dimensions of dreams. His book is a guide to understanding the dreams that lead us into divine realms. He says in the introduction to his book, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dreams that you wake up with, that impress you or shake you: those dreams are allegorical stories, philosophic teachings, pointers on the way to inner development. But it is YOU who must do the developing, the analyzing, the querying, the understanding and interpreting." (p. 7) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To help us learn how to discover our own truths in such dreams, De Beer draws upon the mystical teachings of Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and a variety of Western occult traditions (the range of De Beer's knowledge is quite impressive). His main resource is the theosophy of H.P. Blavatsky, a 19th century mystic who sought to integrate the esoteric teachings of East and West. <em>Dreams</em> is a richly spiritual book, filled with moving personal stories, striking experiences of synchronicity, and powerful encounters with the divine. For anyone intrigued by the mystical dimensions of dreams, De Beer's book will be of great interest. Dreams can be obtained by writing directly to De Beer (34 Raspberry Lane, P.O. Box 598, Umtentweni 4235, South Africa).</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6glorev-1.jpg" width="350px" height="auto"/></p>

<p><strong><em>Dream Symbol Work</em></strong> (New York: Paulist Press, 1991; 162 pp.), also focuses on our relationship with spiritual powers. The authors, Patricia Berne and Louis Savary, also wrote Dreams and Spiritual Growth (1984; Strephon Kaplan-Williams was a co-author), and this book is a simpler, easier-to-use version of that earlier work. Berne and Savary give a nice, neat definition of spirituality: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"For us, spirituality may be defined as 'my way of living, acting, and choosing in light of my ultimate values'." (p. 6) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their main interest is in helping people recognize the spiritual energies in their dreams and bring those energies out into waking life. In this way, Dream Symbol Work is very much a "how-to" book, a practical guide to the spiritual dimension of dreams. </p>

<p>Berne and Savary's basic approach is what I would call a "Jungianized Christianity," or perhaps a "Christianized Jungism." They don't get into much theory, but it's clear that their approach to dreams and spirituality draws directly on Jung and on liberal Christian traditions. In my own view (and I emphasize this is my personal reaction), this sort of Jungliberal Christianity combination misses something important in dreams-it makes everything in our dreams seem a little too smooth, too easy, too routine and expected. This sort of approach never acknowledges how truly weird our dreams are, how our dreams can be incredibly wild, gooey, creepy, and outrageous. Again, I admit that this is a very personal reaction to Berne and Savary's book. But, I love dreams because they open up to us a realm that's crazed, awe-inspiring, shockingly perverse, infinitely creative, and endlessly surprising; dreams bring us into the realm of Bosch's wild paintings of heaven and hell, into the realm of Nietzsche's beautiful, tortured philosophy, into the realm of Jimi Hendrix's passionate guitar improvisations.</p>

<p>Berne and Savary's book doesn't touch on any of this, and that's fine; it's a well-written book and a good introduction for spiritually-oriented novices to dreamwork. But, it doesn't, to my mind, give a very full portrait of the spiritual dimensions of our dreams. To use a wilderness metaphor, the book shows us the nice, flower-blanketed meadows of spirituality, but it says nothing about the raging waterfalls, the dark, eerie caves, or the towering, majestic mountain peaks. </p>

<p>This wilderness metaphor, serendipitously enough, leads into the final book of this review, James Swan's <strong><em>Nature as Healer</em></strong> (New York: Villard Books, 1992; 321 pp.). This book is not directly about dreams; rather, it is about our relationship with nature, how that relationship is broken and how it can be healed. Swan shows how dreams are one extremely valuable means we can use to heal our relationship with nature. </p>

<p>This should be a familiar idea to <em>Dream Network Journal</em> readers, given that a <a href="../bcphbpfnwcb/10.2-3">recent issue</a> (Spring, 1991) was devoted to the subject of dreams and nature. People who study and explore dreams have become increasingly aware that there is an intimate connection between the inner wilderness of our dreams and the outer wilderness of our natural environment. In Swan's book, we see someone on the <em>other</em> side of the equation, the environmental studies side, looking at this same connection. </p>

<p>By profession, Swan is an "environmental psychologist," part of a new field which focuses on the relationship between psychological well-being and the environment. In <em>Nature as Healer</em>, Swan describes how his own dream experiences led him into a deeper, profoundly mystical relationship with the natural world. To explain his understanding of the human-nature relationship, Swan draws upon the ideas of Jung, Mircea Eliade, North American shamans, and various environmental philosophers. It's a very exciting mix, and Swan weaves a narrative that is persuasive and inspiring. His book presents a variety of methods (dream exploration, meditation, ritual, community action) that people can use to deepen their own relationship with nature. <em>Nature as Healer</em> shows how valuable dreams can be in promoting not just personal growth, but collective, communal growth as well. </p>

<p>As these four books prove, dreams are an excellent means of discovering the creative potentials of our relationships. Unfortunately, we live in a civilization that depreciates relationships, that denies the essentially relational nature of human beings. But what that means is that dream exploration now has a deep social potential: learning through our dreams to affirm the power and the value of our relationships is thus a direct, practical way of contributing to the transformation of our civilization. </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> The main critics of this belief, the people who assert the relational nature of the human self, are very much on the defensive these days. Feminists are suffering a powerful "backlash" against their views; Marxian social analysts are fighting against the assumption that the fall of Soviet communism necessarily implies that everything Marx said about capitalism's profound failings is wrong; progressive Jews, Christians, and Muslims are being overwhelmed by reactionary, paranoid fundamentalists. The widely-publicized attacks on "political correctness" in American universities are, in my view, nothing more than the demonizing of these critics, nothing more than the powerful reassertion of that great delusion of the separate, independent, non-relational self.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-3.jpg" width="150px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Dancing is my form of self-expression. I love to have wide open spaces to fill up with my moving body, and music with which to dance that touches my soul. Having taught hundreds and hundreds of children in schools and studios across the country, I can say with great authority that I am not alone in appreciating the pleasure of this physical sensation. Encouraging children to move freely and expressively enables them to maintain the body-mind-spirit connection that is a natural part of childhood exploration and development. </p>

<p>Although my clientele has changed from elementary children to college dancers in the last eight years, my basic goals remain the same: Freedom of expression is what I seek to unlock for college students who enroll in the Dance Improvisation class that I teach. Dance Improvisation is spontaneous movement that springs from an internal source within the individual, as opposed to dance technique, which is a codified movement vocabulary that seeks to achieve a standard of excellence. </p>

<p>My training and experience as a Dance Therapist colors my approach to the students I teach. My objective is to educate the whole person, meeting students where they are in their developmental journey and taking them further down the path of self-knowledge. When the course content is dance, this means that the dancer must thoroughly know his or her body in order to move with abandon. When the goal is to teach choreography, the art of making dances, the choreographer must go within to create work that has depth. </p>

<p>One of the most effective ways I have found of helping students access their own authentic movement source is through ‘Dream Dancing.’ Each person’s dreams are both unique and universal. By going to a personal dream as inspiration for dancing, the individual has everything necessary with which to create: story line, plot, images, action, characters, setting, conflict, climax and resolution. The aspect of this experience that opens up the individual to uninhibited movement exploration is that there is not a right or wrong way to dance a dream. Dreams do not conform to the requirements of daily life or aesthetics. They are not necessarily logical or linear, beautiful or harmonious. Therefore, there are no restrictions placed on Dream Dancing! </p>

<h2>The Dream Dance Activity</h2>

<p>As leader of the Dream Dance Activity, I structure the process carefully to give participants a sense of where the work is going and to answer any initial questions. I assure the dream tellers that they are not required to share anything that feels uncomfortable. I also give permission to stop the dream dancing process if it becomes too difficult or threatening. Then, I talk the participants through each step of the process and facilitate the flow of the session. </p>

<h2>Dream Telling</h2>

<p>The process begins by selecting a partner with whom one will take turns. The first partner verbally shares her dream material, while her partner witnesses her dream telling. Witnessing involves active listening, without interrupting the dream teller with verbal responses or non-verbal signals of approval or disapproval. This enables the person telling her dream to get into a flow-of-consciousness description of her dream. </p>

<h2>Dream Dancing</h2>

<p>The first partner relaxes in a comfortable position on the floor and allows images from her dream telling to arise. I invite her to call the dream characters back into her imagination. Then, as the music begins, the dream dancer begins moving through the shapes and postures that became vivid through the dream telling, as well as the physical actions that evolve out of the reenactment. As she explores her dream dance, her partner witnesses her movement, taking in her body posturing, noticing movement patterns, and making sure she is safe in the space (since the dream dancer may close her eyes). Music accompanies the dream dance to support the process and to provide a timeframe in which participants know they will begin, explore and complete their dances. </p>

<h2>Closure Dialogue</h2>

<p>After the first partner has danced, she receives the gift of a shoulder massage to gently bring her back to alertness. The dream dancer may then begin telling what she experienced or she may ask her witness what he observed, inviting him to reflect back to her what unfolded in the dream dance. (Partners exchange roles and repeat the dream dance process.) </p>

<h2>Dream Dance Reflections</h2>

<p>After both partners have experienced the roles of dream dancer and witness, I welcome them back together as a group and discuss important personal discoveries. I also ask students to write about and draw their in-class experience of the dream dance. The responses are as unique as the individual. </p>

<p>Jennie Melvin depicts her experience this way: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“One of my favorite things that we did in the class this semester was portraying our dreams through dance improvisation—we entered into a place of solitude and then depicted what we saw or felt. While I was ‘dreaming,’ I had an awesome experience. The image that I had was of me walking through a thick forest, dragging through mud and thorns. To me, it symbolized all the stress I was going through at the time. When I reached the end of the forest, I was on one of the most beautiful beaches I had ever seen. In the water was Jesus. I walked toward him and he cleansed me of all the mud and scrapes all over my body. It was so wonderful to dance this dream out.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Della Arrington discusses a greater personal awareness that developed out of the dream dance experience: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“A major part of the class that I enjoyed was the process in which we explored our dreams. It was a very interesting period in which I discovered that I really dream some bizarre things. I always have dreams that are either scary or very sensual. Kissing is a major theme within my dreams. As I was closing my eyes and allowing the dream to flow through my body and communicate, it was interesting to just feel my body being taken over by this passion.” Danielle Lowery describes a sense of acceptance that grew out of the dream dance process: “One of my favorite activities was the dream work session. It felt very relaxing to be able to explore my unconscious thoughts, which are usually suppressed. Working with a partner allowed me to verbally express my inner self without being judged, and also get input on how my portrayal of dreams was interpreted with music. The shoulder massage at the end of this activity was wonderful. It was as if we were being rewarded for being ourselves.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Out of the Nightmare, Into the Light</h2>

<p>The Dream Dance is not simply an exercise I reserve for students. I find it to be an excellent way to process my most powerful dreams. I don’t shy away from ‘scary dreams’ that are desperately trying to get my attention. That is where I begin. </p>

<h2>The Victim and The Perpetrator</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-1.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>In my dream telling, I begin with an anxiety-producing nightmare: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This woman tells these people she is protecting them from something evil and takes large sums of money from them. However, there is no real threat. I see her go to her car, pop the trunk and inside, there is a barrel. She takes the locked-down lid off and a very wealthy woman very slowly unfolds her body and emerges. People everywhere are being released. Then, the lie of the danger is told to all.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This nightmare brings up very strong feelings in me. Immediately after having this dream, I write in my dream journal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am horrified by the entrapment. I cannot imagine wishing to survive in that barrel. I feel like hurting the woman that trapped those people by making them victims of their own fear. As I awaken, to my horror at seeing this poor woman emerge from this barrel, I say, ’I would never have the will to survive that.’”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first response to the dream is to sympathize with the wealthy woman who paid a great fortune for protection from her greatest fear: an overwhelming sense of evil. However, there really is no external evil. Instead, her fear traps her in a place that is not fit for human habitation. She hides away from an active life. She allows physical boundaries to contain her. I am horrified by the existence she has had to endure. I can’t imagine being able to tolerate such torment. When she emerges, I can see her wealth; therefore, she must possess obvious gifts. </p>

<p>My next reaction is that I want to punish the woman who has perpetrated this atrocity. The depths of her darkness are unfathomable. How can anyone be so hateful? For me, she embodies the very worst possible female. She wins the trust of the helpless, takes their finest gifts, and then imprisons them with their own permission under false pretenses. </p>

<p>In this dream, I see my shadow reflected in both the victim and the perpetrator. As the victim, I surrender what is best about me to a situation that feels confining at its best and suffocating at its worst. Fearing to expose the very worst in me, I stuff myself into a mold. Even though I cannot breathe, I attempt to keep my Self under control, at all personal costs. The vulnerability of my soul is the victim. As the perpetrator, I commit a most horrific crime of the heart. I convince myself that what I’m doing is a necessary evil. The wild side of me needs to be kept under lock and key. The perpetrator is my Judge, she who knows best. </p>

<p>In the dream, I sell my Self out. I take all my greatest gifts—all of my creativity, love and passion—and stuff them into a filthy, dark, dank barrel which presses in on me and stops everything but the faintest heart beat and shallowest breath. There I sentence my soul to solitary confinement until I can get my Self more in line with my persona. There I waiver, uncertain I can convince myself to keep breathing, where survival does not feel like a worthy choice. </p>

<p>By dancing these characters, I begin to understand why this particular dream came to me. My dream portrays two polar opposites. Perhaps this dream is trying to help me see both of these aspects of myself: the consenting, passive victim and the perpetrator of the crime, the judge. Dancing these dream characters is a very intense experience. This place is too painful for me to linger long. I move into the protagonist of my next dream. </p>

<h2>The Goddess</h2>

<p>The second dream that I explore in the dream dance portrays a very different image of a woman: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am outside in the country on a very sunny day. I’m standing with my legs in a strong, wide stance with my feet planted in the earth, my arms flung open wide, and my head tilted toward the sky. As a snake slithers between my feet, I startle awake.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream character is a Goddess, strong and receptive. Dancing this dream feels delightful! The arm movements open from the heart. My lower body is powerful and grounded. I breathe deeply as I explore this dream image. I look upward as my gestures extend away from my center toward the sky. I also release my body into gravity, sliding toward the floor. The snake brings the connection with the dark, hidden places of the earth. Rolling and pressing against the floor, I connect with this snake energy. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grroth-2.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This dream dance experience did not end for me when my class was over. Instead, it highlights my need to further explore these dreams. I dance these dream images in the studio alone. I write about them. I draw the barrel and the Goddess. I narrate the dream dance for witnesses. I process the dreams with a Jungian analyst. I research the Snake Goddess. I compile visual art images that portray both the barrel nightmare and the sunlit dream. </p>

<p>My in-class exploration of this dream dance exercise has sparked the dance that I am currently creating for my dance company. In the process of describing recurring nightmare images and dancing those postures and places that haunt my dreams, I realized I had a dance that needed to unfold. After exploring these dreams further, I knew that I would entitle the dance, ‘Out of the Nightmare, Into the Light.’ The title provides a road map of the dance for me. I begin with the first anxiety-producing dream, take the audience through a full range of nightmare scenarios of oppression, and then move into the light of the Goddess, still grounded by the presence of the snake. The dance is not yet finished, but the process is exhilarating! </p>

    ns1:description """<p>In all the groups that I've participated in throughout my life, whether educational, political, artistic, professional and even ones based on mere conviviality, the undermining elements of factionalism, ego conflicts and various other differences have interfered with achieving a lasting sense of genuine conspiracy. Originating in the shadow sides of our psyches and hidden by our facile personas, these factors serve to discourage healthy and effective group functioning on many levels, in terms of achieving consensus, creating viable solutions to problems and gaining clarity of visionary goals/objectives for the group. </p>

<p>Why, in spite of sharing common interests, political, socioeconomic and humanitarian values, are we unconsciously antagonistic towards the groups we choose to be a part of? What kinds of subjective reluctance do we harbor in fully contributing ourselves to the group consciousness? James Hillman observes that, "the Self is the interiorization of community." Yet what exactly prevents us from reaching the Self, the ultimate core of the psyche and experiencing truly universal communion with others?</p>

<p>My experiences with persistent group dysfunction prompted me to develop a dreamwork technique which I call "Integrative Dream Narration" (IDN). I first tried IDN on a class of art students who, myself included, could not fully cooperate with one another in a way conducive to our spiritual, artistic and intellectual well being. I had each participant write a dream synopsis on a notecard, emphasizing the use of symbolic, transformative dreams concerning wholeness, i.e., getting in contact with the Self. I then combined the dreams to create a collective story which all could listen to and participate in, since each individual dream contributed to the cohesiveness of the narration. </p>

<p>The inherent fluidity of dreams became much more apparent, for I did not have to struggle to synthesize the dreams as they seemed to coalesce on their own accord, like tributaries flowing naturally into a river and then into the communal ocean. Instead of assuming the role of an improviser or story I was more like a mediator of the unconscious mind of the group. </p>

<p>When I finished the story, class members sat in peaceful silence. The narration had encouraged a shared consciousness amongst us. We all seemed to be open to one another and breathing together in the true sense or conspiracy. No one was prompted to speak right away. We all enjoyed this feeling of being fully present, instead of just pretending to be together under the guise of a shared interest. None of us, it seemed, needed to follow the impulses of our egos to rationalize and explain the experience away. During the rest of the class, we were able to come to a consensus as to how the remainder of the semester would be navigated and actually came up with a syllabus which all agreed upon. </p>

<p>I have since employed Integrative Dream Narration to enhance the integrity of many different collectives - from musical and spiritual to political - with very effective, though never predictable, results. Many of the resistances we have toward surrendering to a group consciousness - resistances deeply rooted in fear - loosen up and a newfound integrity is created. </p>

<p>The word, "Integrity" has its etymological meaning: "entire, untouched, unmarred, an original state." What has so thwarted the success of many different groups, I feel, has been the inability to recognize the sense of entirety and originality that is always present, if only subliminally. For example, the Australian Aborigines considered Alcheringa or Dreamtime to be the original state of the world prior to the arrival of human beings. Dreamtime was the world in its unmarred entirety (the Self). </p>

<p>IDN serves to facilitate a contact with the <em>primordial</em> community, encouraging an experience of interrelatedness that helps to diminish many anxieties and isolating/ alienating effects that are often deliberately promoted in consumerist societies. A holistic communication, both in speaking, listening and feeling, becomes possible once the collective dream matrix is brought into awareness and utilized, when it is substantially grounded in the body politic, so to speak. Since many illnesses- both the somatic and psychic- are induced and prolonged by blockages, encouraging the opening up of communicative channels on all levels allows mind, body and spirit to align themselves to a healing sensibility. This is true not only from within oneself but from within others as well. IDN influences and heightens one's awareness of shared experiences - of the subtle body - that are for the most part rooted in unconsciousness and remain unrecognized by most of us. Especially when we spend so much of our time maintaining our protective personas when amongst others and outside of the comfortable circle of our families and friends. </p>

<p>Dreams in themselves have a fluid, autonomous quality to them. We are constantly astonished by what our unconscious minds can create. The word <em>influence</em> has its origins in the word <em>fluid</em>. Directing the current of dreams towards communal integrity can greatly enhance the success and effectiveness of small group functioning and its influence upon our collective environment. The profound sense of inter-relatedness evoked by IDN has its basis in synchronicity, or the merging of outer and inner events to create meaning. To paraphrase it in Jungian terms, IDN evokes synchronicities as a result of the dreams being combined. On an intuitive level, awareness of synchronicity becomes heightened, in not only the narrator but the participants as well and it influences the direction the narration takes by sensing what is occurring when each individual integrates into the group dream dynamic. </p>

<p>The matrices within which synchronicities occur can be perceived and/or experienced, i.e., the psychic space which encompasses both inner and outer worlds in which so-called coincidences happen. Imagine the possibilities of creating atmospheres where synchronicities occur, like a lightening storm, through our combined dreams. </p>

<p>I once gave a demonstration of Integrative Dream Narration to a group of forty people. Six souls volunteered to participate and contributed their chosen dreams. One dream concerned a woman who was led by three angels to what she called a "Wellness Spa" but she didn't know how to run the place. Another woman dreamt that her grandmother was pregnant. One participant dreamt that her ex-boyfriend appeared and told her how sad he was that they were no longer together. </p>

<p>During the course of the unpremeditated narration, everyone arrived at the wellness spa where there was a fountain in the center. (I always emphasize communal places where all can gather). The grandmother gave painless, underwater birth to a golden baby. The baby was then handed to the woman who came to the fountain with her ex-boyfriend. I finished the narration, making sure all dreams offered were included in the story... and listened to enthusiastic comments from the participants and the audience. Afterwards, the woman who dreamt about her ex-boyfriend came up to me and confided, "I didn't want to say this in front of everyone but the reason that my boyfriend and I broke up is because I wanted to have a child."</p>

<p>As I proceeded with the narration, something in me or rather, in the Integrated Dream Community, intuited this and had the baby handed to the couple as some sort of reconciliation which I intuitively sensed was needed. The combination of these dreams created the matrix in which this synchronicity took place. As the narrator, my sense of individuality became less and less pronounced as all the dreams were combined. Perhaps synchronicities occur outside of the realm of the ego and it is only when we are not solely in this realm that we experience them. The synchronicities that occurred during the narration manifest also in bodily response, in both the narrator and participants. At first there is a considerable amount of tension, which is natural when strangers come together to form a group. The tension is usually born of the illusion of a sense of separateness among the participants. Breathing becomes restricted (the antitheses of conspiracy or breathing together). </p>

<p>But when all the dreams are integrated, the tension dissolves and what I sense as the collective heart, begins to beat and open up... the heart of understanding which transcends judgment, definition and ego centered identity. Interiorization of the communal heart in turn opens one's own heart, creating a reciprocal balance between self and group. As I proceed with the narration I feel blockages in my own body begin to open, for my body is but a microcosm of the collective dream macrocosm. I cannot emphasize enough that participants pay attention to their bodies during the narration. The results of opening are beneficial in allowing a person to respond to their own dreams in a way devoid of the usual anxieties born of trying to interpret (as opposed to integrating) the dreams.</p>

<p>Once an awareness of the relation between one's body and the integrated dream body is achieved, the next stage of the IDN dream work method is an interactive one, i.e., participants are asked to contribute to the narration, instead of just one person creating what happens. The interaction takes place not only in oral articulation of dreams but in working with imagery and movement as well, creating a foundation on which to base further involvement in collective dreamwork. In essence, a dream democracy is being created every time IDN is used. </p>

<p>Integrative Dreamwork has not only promising therapeutic potentials but most importantly political ones as well. The political dimension is tragically absent in many aspects of the New Age movement and it is time to act. Imagine integrating the dreams of a dysfunctional family to create a harmonious dream consciousness. Consider the long range benefits of integrating the dreams of the board members of major corporations with its employees. Or consider integrating the dreams of a republican with those of a democrat. The collective dream body created from such integrations could hold the key to long range solutions to some of our most immediate and seemingly irresolvable problems. Here are the guidelines for the technique or rather psychnique, as I call it: </p>

<h2>Integrative Dream Narration: The Process</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Have each participant (there should be no more than five or six) sit in a circle and pass around color coded notecards. Participants are instructed to write their dreams down, legibly, particularly ones that are highly symbolic and important to them. The dreams should not be read by other participants. A synopsis of the dream is adequate as long as a meaningful scene or symbol is included. Extended or complicated dreams do not work well. Always emphasize the inclusion of an important scene in the dream, if the dream itself is too long but the participant wants to contribute it. The dream narrator leaves the room. </p></li>
<li><p>The dream narrator enters the room, sits down and reviews the note cards that have been gathered by shuffling through them and imprinting images, sequences, even the tone of dreams in her/his memory. It is best for Dream Narrators to go through the cards two or three times. Writing down clues as to how the dreams could be connected on a separate sheet of paper is helpful in making sure all dreams are integrated. </p></li>
<li><p>The Dream Narrator initiates the Integrative Dream Narration by using one of her/his dreams, one that has been evoked by reviewing the notecards and/or a pre-chosen dream. Once a portion of the dream is conveyed, the narrator begins to integrate participants' dreams into the story. The narrator can pause and instructs the participants to pay attention to their bodies throughout the narration, i.e., changes in breathing, where they are holding tension, where they are relaxing. </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to ask if everyone's dream has been included before continuing. When all the participants dreams have been integrated, the narrator pauses and allows the participants to sense the integral presence of the collective dream matrix evoked by incorporating all dreams into the narration. The participants are instructed to begin breathing deeply for a few moments, noting where they may be holding tension in their bodies while encouraging them to let go of the tensions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Integrative Dream Narration is resumed and then brought to some 'completion', i.e. a sense of wholeness or resolve. The facilitator sounds out a color and the person whose notecard corresponds to that color shares with the group what dream she/he contributed. When all have shared their individual dreams, breath awareness is resumed. Instruct all participants to return to their bodies and become centered and separate.</p></li>
</ol>

    ns1:description """<p>The best news far in 1997 has been an invitation to write a column for <em>Dream Network</em>. I have chosen the title <em>Network Nous</em>, using the Ionian philosopher Anaxagoras's coinage for what he perceived as the universal mind. The scientist Itzhak Bentov in his book, <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em> calls it the Isoelectric field which surrounds the earth. The Jesuit Priest, Teilhard De Chardin used the Catholic modifier: Noosphere. Many other names from all dreams of life describe the phenomena of shared mind as well. It is poignantly embodied in what is called the Erur dream, which translated means 'circle dream' where the initiate dreams of putting his arms around the world with the fingers touching, an all embracing symbol of global knowledge. </p>

<p>In Vol. 13 #3 of Dream Network, I premiered with an article called <em>Integrative Dream Narration</em> which describes a psychnique I've devised where individual dreams are merged into a collective story to create a shared consciousness, an oneiric Nous of sorts. I have been researching dreams and dreamwork for 25 years and am currently writing a book called Dream Democracy where I express my belief that dreams are urging us on to a more substantially political involvement in life. Currently residing in Minneapolis, MN., I am a freelance writer, art critic, intuitive counselor and valet/ferryman at a nearby old folks home as well.</p>

<p>In Network Nous, we will be specifically exploring how dreams have assisted in furthering the betterment of humanity by offering up the seeds of discovery, which in turn inspire practical inventions, artistic creations, as well as spiritual and secular visions. In the Islamic tradition, dreamed ideas such as these are the result of 'Istikhara' which means 'asking a favor of heaven.' In Sufism they could be considered a form of 'tallaji' which indicates 'a breakthrough of the limitations of time and space'. Inventionary dreams assist us in breaking through outdated belief systems, dogmas and doctrines and other restrictive codicils. </p>

<p>Historical as well as contemporary examples of dreams will be included in this column. Exploration will be employed as an alternative to interpretation and analysis. It is my belief that inventionary dreams hold energy patterns (morphogenetic fields) that we can utilize and benefit from. For all dreams are interconnected in a kind of electrostatic field in the collective unconscious waiting to be reactivated and utilized. </p>

<p>From St. Augustine to August Kekule and his Benzene ring dream to St. Perpetua and Joan de Arc's dream of leading an army to victory, we will investigate creationary and inventionary dreams themselves in confidence that they will serve as a catalyst for furthering our current dreams into manifest reality. But first let us start in the 1600s, when most of our recent troubles began, troubles which have made it exceedingly difficult to break completely through the limitations of time and space. </p>

<p>One of the most ironic conceits in western philosophical history is that Rene Descartes, the infamous 17th Century French philosopher who helped spark the Enlightenment, formulated his doctrine of mind body dualism from a series of dreams he had. How he tried to permanently rend the mind from the body, making reason reign eternally supreme all the while using the wellsprings of the irrational as inspiration, is a most vexing and troublesome quandary. When one regards just how psychologically, environmentally and spiritually devastating such a rift has been, even in our holographic era, the paradox becomes even more troubling. Could Rene, with pineal idiosyncrasy, have misinterpreted the deeper import of the dreams themselves? Was he fearful of what the dreams were really trying to tell him? Could his philosophy of reason have been a cerebral career move, a panicky defense against what the dreams were really trying to urge him towards? See Karl Stern's book <em>Flight From Women</em>. He offers some viable interpretations of Descartes's dreams in an attempt to answer these questions. </p>

<p>Three hundred years later, a teenager dreamed of riding a sled so fast that the stars in the sky started to distort into fantastic shapes and beautiful colors. This dream led him to eventually develop a unified counterpoint (with a three century pause between the notes) to Cartesian doubt. Mr. Einstein's unconscious was merely counter pointing, if not counter-punning with a kind of relative resolution or retribution which would once again reunite mind, body, even soul into a unified field of dreams. I suspect dream fugues of this nature are occurring at all times around the world. Perhaps there are contemporary dreams answering to the echoes of paleolithic dreams in such a fashion. We simply need to dilate our dream awareness to embrace such synchronic and diachronic fugues. </p>

<p>Even after the Tallaji of Einstein and others, the Cartesian illusion still dictates much of how we conduct our lives. Our science and industry for-profit organizations still rely on mind-body dualism which is used in attempt to control our world, make us unhappy. The dubious reputation for abstraction (from the word abstrahere: to draw away from) institutions ranging from the National Rifle Association to the National Academy of the Sciences have could very well be counterpointed if dreams are included in papers written by scientists, researchers, underwriters, in patent applications, even W-2 forms! Not just written descriptions and compulsory interpretations but drawings and paintings of the symbols, locales and dream personae as well. Imagine Ph.D theses peppered with dream icons instead of bar graphs and charts! Or how about a scientist dancing a dream in front of the members of the National Academy of the Sciences. A doctor doing a dream cha-cha for the AMA? All these are near-fetched possibilities if we simply ask a favor of our dreams to reveal the inventions needed to bridge the rift.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Keeping an extensive dream journal on a computer for the last three years has proven to offer insights hardly expected from such a medium. As an example, one morning after writing a dream down, I tried to save the file onto the hard drive, using the date of the dream, 1-24, as the file name. I had previously saved all my dream entries using the date of the dream as the file name. My computer beeped a warning and the following message came up: Replace existing 1-24? I canceled the save command for I didn't want to wipe out the existing file. Curious, I double clicked on the file's icon. I discovered that I had written a dream down exactly one year before, using the same date (month and day without the year) as the file name of the dream entry I was trying to save at the moment. Once the file opened, I found that the year old dream was so similar to the one I just had written down, that it prompted me to investigate further into these peculiar cybersynchronicities. </p>

<p>The dream I had on 1-24-98 was of two calves emerging out of a barn to snuggle up to me. After their expression of such charming bovine affection, they then swam off in tandem across a lake. I then read the dream I had written on 1-24-97. I discovered that I had a dream in which a bear ambled out of a cave, came up, snuggled me and then rested its head on my lap, after expressing such charming arkturial affection! </p>

<p>Many chronological dream synchronicities have been uncovered with the method of opening up the Find File program and searching for dreams written, one, two, three years ago. If you have kept dream journals on your computer, I suggest becoming familiar with the Find File command on your PC. Use the month and day as the file name for your dream entries without the year. This will enable you to swiftly search through your dreams and see if there are any annual matches. The Find File technique is useful for those who are aware of reoccurring dreams but want to find if there is any underlying pattern to the reoccurrences. </p>

<p>Depending on how long you have kept your dreams on your computer, this mode of inquiry affords instant access in a way that paper bound journals cannot. The immediacy of the data's appearance on the computer monitor's screen affords a view of dreams that cannot be had by merely thumbing back through the tattered pages of a dream journal scrawled with nearly incoherent, pre coffee writing and searching for recognizable patterns of reoccurrence. Using the Find File command, I have discovered that not only the people and animals in the dreams themselves reoccur, but plots, outcomes, environments, atmospheres and even feeling tones as well. </p>

<p>The synchronicities have led me to believe that dreams are not purely acausal or random as they have been described to be by some of the founding forepeople of psychotherapy. Perhaps when one looks at an individual dream and its lack of continuity and at times coherency, that may seem to be the case. But when one pulls back, opens the camera lens wide and looks at the larger composition of dream cycles, a recognizable pattern pattern/ paradigm can indeed be discerned. Then, with an expanded perspective, the patterns become meaningful. Computer dream journals can help promote this kind of enhanced, chronological appreciation of dreams, adding a new dimension to interpretation and understanding. Our electronic dream journals can become, after a few years, a Farmer's Almanac of the unconscious. We can access such an almanac when we want to plant, cultivate and harvest our dreams according to the waxing and waning of our inner moon. </p>

<p>The discoveries of such timely reoccurrences in dream patterns via the computer has inspired me to regard such dream cycles as being universal in nature. Within our personal dreams lie some important clues to the larger and broader cycles, meta-patterns of reoccurrence over vast distances of time, from the Nimesha (eye blink) of the Big Bang birth to the final minutes of the Day of Brahmin which consists of 4,320,000,000 years. (Imagine a dream journal kept for that many years! Imagine the galactic synchronicities one could discover!) Appreciating the cycles of the universe's dream, enables us to expand our awareness to these vast cosmological levels. We can then regard our dreams as being a part of such extensive cycles much more expansive than we normally do. We can appreciate that our dreams actually influence these larger cycles. </p>

<p>With practice, using the Find File mode of investigation, whether on our physical computers or through active imagination, we may be able to pinpoint a decade, a year, perhaps even a moment of quality time in the Precambrian era. We may be able to hone in on a morphogenetic field of a Trilobite and see what it was dreaming way back when and see if it in any way corresponds to what we dreamt about last night or last year.</p>

So, if you could speak to that magical ability, I think it would serve anyone attempting to work with dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Not magical, but imaginal. When I develop an image-centered relationship with the figures, by that I mean entering their world on their terms, images come to life, present themselves, say, “Here we are.” On the other hand, when or if we meet the dream for the purposes of interpreting or analyzing, then we’re going to bring our rational mind only into relationship with the material or content of the dream. At that moment, the visitation is lost, the actuality of its presence disappears. To witness the activity of a living image is a very different mode of perceiving and therefore a quality of relationship is needed. The “trick” is to meet the dream in the way of the dream. When I bring a dream-like consciousness to the dream then one thing happens, dreams come alive; and if I bring a rational, analytical mind for the purposes of interpreting the dream, then something else altogether takes place, dreams become static. It’s not that interpretation or analysis is bad, it’s just that my preference is to first let the dream come forward to show itself as its Self, as an embodied enactment; then, secondly, to bring my capacity for insight or analysis. I think that is what you are most likely noticing. It really is a different mode all together. It’s a mode of perception that is anchored in an imaginal consciousness rather than an exclusively logical, scientific mind. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How do you teach that or suggest that people wishing to get there begin the process?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> There are four core skills that I suggest experimenting with. One is curiosity. When we get curious, we get interested. Rather than jumping so quickly to what we think the dream means, we get curious and follow the activity of the images and the figures of the dream. Curiosity takes us to a very different place altogether. The second, along with curiosity, is a way of listening. One way of listening is to listen for the purposes of offering an answer. So, we’re already rehearsing what the answer or the response will be before we have even listened fully to what is being presented. When tending dreams, it’s a question of taking a deep breath, getting anchored, and becoming receptive and responsive: listening first and allowing the conversation to emerge out of the silence, rather than using our active mind to fill the space. Responsive listening is the second skill. The third is to really pay attention to detail or particularity. Rather than seeing each image as the same— for example, the elephant, or even the house as all being of one kind— noticing how each image comes with its particular distinction. When we view every house or creature or elephant or animal as the same we go into a kind of explanatory system and begin to categorize these images. On the other hand, if we notice that each house is different in its own details and that each animal or creature has its own particularity or uniqueness or oddity, then we slow down, take the time to watch and look and carefully notice its particular actuality. The fourth core skill is patience. In order for images to reveal who they are, we must slow down and be patient. With patience, images will reveal what they offer from the inside out. Working with these core skills we get interested in the “visitation” of the living images. We are asking the question, “Who is visiting now?” rather, than being hell bent on determining, “What does this mean?” Our insistence on “getting to the bottom of things,” and finding the “correct answer” or “meaning” renders the image lifeless. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That’s a lovely way of answering that question.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> It’s similar to the artistic process, I would imagine. When I watch you dance, for example, one way is to rehearse the steps and know the choreography; and that’s wonderful, helpful. Another way is to know the choreography and then in performance to allow something else to move through and fill the body. There’s a certain spontaneity that goes with the discipline. It makes all the difference. When you watch, some people fill the room with their resonant quality. They originate from a deeper source. Other people are moving through the action but you don’t have a sense of their depth of presence. And the same is true, I find, when working with a dream. When we work out of the deeper sources, something comes forward that otherwise would not. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What is your feeling about working with dream images to create poetry, haiku, or dance?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Well, I think that the psyche itself is poetic from the beginning. So, there’s a poetics of psychic reality; it’s not as linear or rational or literal as we might imagine. Rather, there’s a certain kind of poetry that’s always going on. After all, the dreams, when they come forward, aren’t in paragraphs or sentences. They present themselves in imagery, and often in story, gesture, or sound. A certain quality of metaphoric elaboration is already a part of the enactment. There’s a poetic quality from the beginning. To meet the poetic psyche in the way of a poem is very different than to meet it as a literary critic, for example. I think to appreciate that a poetic quality is already a part of the dream is to listen and allow the dream to live in its own rhythm, its own complexity, and its own intelligence. It’s just remarkable to imagine that every day there are a thousand images available to depict any particular dream motif. The dreaming psyche “chooses” a particular set of images and after creatively combining them, putting them together, a story comes forward that at first glance often makes no sense whatsoever to the rational mind. Yet, once you start listening with a poetic ear, something altogether different happens. It’s as if the poetry is already there presenting itself for those who have metaphoric ears to listen and aesthetic eyes to see. And like seeing through a looking glass, each dream is multi-leveled like a parable, commenting on circumstances of the day, on my life history, and on the archetypal themes that are running through it. In addition, it’s picking up on images or expressions from the world’s psyche or the world’s soul. All that’s happening and can only happen as a creative presentation. Otherwise, every dream would be two volumes of written narrative. Like a great painting, it captures us and opens us in multiple ways, which is what I think dreams are meant to do. They come forward and, when we tend them, rather than interpret or analyze; they engage our imagination. Like an extraordinary painting or a great piece of art or a remarkable piece of theatre or dance, dreams resonate with poetic depth. That which is to be revealed will become known if we allow ourselves to take a step back and allow them to work on us as much as we work on them. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> One phrase that has resonated with me for a long time that you often say is that “the body is always dreaming.” Long before I ever started studying dreamwork, I was using dance as a way of working with my dreams, not to analyze or necessarily even understand, but to make the image alive for me. I just want to hear how you are now with the idea that “the body is always dreaming.”  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I have a couple of ideas about that. As I have suggested, I don’t think dreams originate in our rational mind. They originate from a deeper source. One such source is the body. When we experience an upset stomach, or a place in our back where we’re feeling tight, or the onset of a cold or flu, or more seriously, something like a cancerous growth, the dreaming psyche is going to pick up those symptoms and most likely present them in the imagery of dreams. On that level, the body is always dreaming. So, when we listen to dreams, we are always listening to the body talk about itself in one way or the next. On another dimension, images themselves come with body. They are alive and active and they walk about. They breathe and have presence and pulse. They certainly are not incarnate like our bodies, but in an imaginal context—in the world of dream—they’re very interactive and very embodied. In that context embodied images have emotion or feeling. It’s not only we who have emotions in response to the image. Images will come with emotions to begin with and then in turn create an affect inside of us. It’s simply a different way of appreciating dream and it’s not esoteric. It’s very “just so.” When we take the time to listen to dream or to watch the actuality of the dream presentation, we see images walking about affecting one another—one figure impacting another figure. Embodied images are filled with emotions and feelings; and they tend to evoke our response. We then can allow our bodies to move with gesture or even with dance to greet the image. In a curious way, in those moments we are interpreting the dream—not through words or through our mind-—but through our bodies. We’re meeting the image body of the dream with our bodies. That kind of interaction I find quite important and useful. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How about those dreams in which—not people—but animals are communicating with us?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Our tendency is to interpret the animal or capture it or dissect it like you would a butterfly; put it in the case and label it. The animal means an in-law or the animal means an aggressive creature like a boss that’s overly aggressive or it may be a partner who is overbearing. Our tendency is to attribute personal characteristics to the creatures. There’s probably some value to that, actually. In addition, though, the animal has its own reality, its own autonomy, its own independence, and its own presence. In all the stories when we follow the animal something out of the ordinary is bound happen. When the creature comes and you follow, we find our way “back to Kansas.” When ET comes, something “out of this world” reveals itself. Animals forever take us on a journey, are important guides through unknown terrain, or serve as important teachers. Sometimes they even come to us as ancestral spirits. So, I always suggest taking great care to listen to the intelligence that lives in the animal and taking the time to follow the animal. If you follow the animal, something unexpected tends to show up. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You have a book coming out quite soon.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yes, in the first part of next year. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What can you tell us about it?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> The book is called Dream Tending, and it documents the approach that I use with dreams. It is woven around a personal story. There are some personal reflections about my experience and my relationship to dream and how it has affected my own life. There are many teaching points. So, it covers the primary ideas that anchor Dream Tending. It talks about the concept of the “living image.” The book has a full chapter about tending nightmares. It has a section about tending images as medicines for work with physiological aliments and illness. Part of the book describes in detail Dream Council, which is a way of sustaining relationship in a long-term way with dreams. And too, the book talks about the World’s Dream, an eco-psychological approach to dream work. In addition to the teaching points, there is an experiential component, so that people who are reading the book will have an opportunity to work with their dreams. There are particular exercises or methods that are presented—tools that are embedded all throughout the text that will help people work with their dreams and have an actual experience of what tending to a dream is and how that is different than simply interpreting or analyzing a dream. When tending a dream, there is an immediate correspondence to the challenges presented by daily life. In fact, in the book I have a section on the practical applications of working with dreams. I offer skills, elaborations, and case examples of working with dreams in the workplace, in intimate love relationships, in relation to money, and vocation. So, there are a lot of practical applications of how to work with this material in relationship to issues of everyday life. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How does the book play into the huge following of people who have taken the Dream Tending classes and those who are interested but haven’t yet participated?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> The challenge of the book is to do two things. One is to really put a lot of what I’ve been working on for now over thirty years in one place, so that people will have a foundational text or a touchstone out of which to continue and sustain their practice of dream tending. To work with dream, to tend dream, is a life practice as much as it is a therapy. It’s a way of being in the world, oriented and anchored in dream, in a relationship to dream. So on one hand, I think it is going to be very helpful and useful for those who have worked with me and worked with the art. In addition, the book is written in such a way that a person who has never been acquainted with my work or has never worked with dream will have an opportunity to move through the book gradually and find the methods and the tools that they might find useful in developing a relationship with a dream. So, it’s really working on two different dimensions at the same time. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You also have a DVD out now. My experience of it is that it is very beautiful.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yes. There’s a DVD—about an hour long—and that’s about the Dream Tending method and it depicts it in visual form. Then, there’s a CD series through Sounds True that’s just been reissued. It’s a six CD set on Dream Tending that provides the methods and the tools and examples and it’s in narrative. So, between the movie and the CDs and now the book, there should be a lot of information as to how to work with dream from this point of view. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Where do you think your work will take you now that you have this concrete piece of it complete?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I’m doing a couple of things that I find most exciting. I’m working with at risk teenagers, actually, working with dream and working with this approach to dream; working with kids that have been in and out of jail and having a hard time with drugs, school, or a really difficult time in family life. Many of them are coming from juvenile hall, so you would not think that dreams would be the medium that would be useful. It is surprising, and quite frankly, deeply satisfying to work with a group of 20 or 30 teenagers in each session who are pretty hardcore by any of our standards; and yet, you introduce image or you introduce the idea of dream and imagination gets ignited and we’re talking story and all kinds of things start coming forward. The liberation to engage the most tortuous of feelings and life circumstances is remarkable. We are in deep conversation for hours on end. So, I’m very interested in doing more of that. I’m also working with a project of the United Nations, working with dreams in relationship to international environmental policy formation. Bringing dream work to this initiative, the development of an Earth Charter, is instructive because with dream we start at the place that honors multiple perspectives. As we know, embedded in the imagery of dreams many points of view present themselves from the get-go. Dreams are an under utilized resource and a little known source of intelligence in the world of diplomacy. We get so fixed in our positions; and yet, when dream or image or story comes forward, we’re placed, at once, in imagination and we’re looking at things from many different angles. So, I’ve introduced dreamwork into a number of forums now: working with the policy development and also working with leaderships groups at this level. What’s been gratifying for me is bringing groups of people together that otherwise would be in conflict. I have found that dreams are a way into what lives at the core of our humanity. When dream work comes into the room so does compassion, understanding, empathy, and a willingness to work through our differences and find common ground. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> One question that was offered by the editor of Dream Network Journal was any relationship you might find between the dream and the political environment right now as we approach the election.  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> I was just in Europe and talking about the current presidential election. I was offering lectures from a depth psychological perspective about Americans’ reaction to the war in the Middle East. I was talking about this in relation to dream. What came back from audience after audience was a powerful response to the political dialogue unfolding in the United States. The power of the imagery is vivid and vital. The interest, the curiosity, more importantly, the passion that gets constellated around what is happening in this country is being experienced as nothing less than a revolution of thought and mind. What is being sparked is way bigger than what most Americans can imagine at the moment. And of course, that has to do with the Obama phenomenon and the presidential election. People are responding strongly overseas, just as they are in this country. I suspect it is similar to what happened when the presence of Lincoln or FDR or even for that brief moment Kennedy was at work in the imagination. What’s being evoked is a revolutionary impulse. Folks were not telling me that they were seeing Obama or McCain as literal figures in their dreams, but I have picked up, again and again, a certain kind of rising tide of passion. I’m not sure it’s linked only to this particular election. It’s linked to something else that is operating in the Zeitgeist at the moment. On the one hand, there are images of liberation appearing more frequently in dreams. On the other hand, images of grief are also making their presence known. I think they go hand-in-hand. I think the new news is that in the United States, in our psychology, collectively, there tends to be a lot of grief that’s coming forward as well as the more obvious enthusiasm. Of course, the dream images of grief can be attributed to the war that seems to be never ending, to environmental concerns like global warming, or to the worries about the impending economic recession/depression, but it seems much deeper than that. It seems as if, in a curious way, in the psyche of Americans, there’s a grief over the Empire itself. We’re coming to terms with the idea that we are not any longer Number One on the planet. That fall from grace, the idea that other countries, other nations, are emerging, and we, as the dominant empire, are on the wane; there’s a kind of grief that comes from that. It creates a kind of numbness or a kind of denial. And, of course, when not fully conscious, then the dreaming psyche will pick that up. What I’m experiencing is not only dreams of liberation and other corresponding images of hope and desire that Europeans and Asians are having about America, but here in the United States, I am seeing a lot of imagery that depicts grief, dying and death. Our first response is to literalize these images. A figure dies in the dream and we imagine an aspect of our personality that’s dying or somebody in our world is in ill health or we’re dreaming of our own mortality. I think, collectively however, that there is something going on in the Deep Psyche that knows somehow that the global dominance of the American Empire is coming to an end. That’s what I would say. I think the Obama phenomenon, in some ways, is a response to that grief. I think that the political dreams of our day have as much to do with the process of dying as they do with the desire for change. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What else would you like to share? What have we not touched?  </p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> About 30 years ago, when I first started working with dreams, dreaming was very popular. Working with dreams was a popular phenomenon. I think it started all those years back with Carlos Castaneda and lucid dreaming, going back years now. There was a kind of curiosity in the interest of dreams. It was all the rage. Dream books were selling as soon as they hit the shelves. The field of Depth Psychology was coming forward through the Human Potential Movement. The work of Jung was beginning to take hold in this country and other places. The mythology of Joseph Campbell became popular. There was a kind of move toward imagination and dream. Over the last ten or fifteen years, much of the popular interest vanished. People were not as interested. But in the last year or so, there seems to be a resurgence of fascination in dreaming and in the imagination in general. The imaginative processes are again capturing the curiosity of so many people. Everywhere from Oprah to late night radio, we’re beginning to hear people talk about dream and getting interested in dream. As I travel around the country, workshops are much more highly attended. So, I think there is a renaissance of interest at the moment. What I advocate is that people get into small dream groups. I know that for a long time that was frowned upon and people thought it was best only to work with dream one-on-one. But now, more than ever, I think there’s a kind of a call back to the earlier times in human experience where people gathered together in small groups and talked story and talked dream. We all don’t need to be psychoanalysts or trained therapists. It’s just okay to sit and tell about our dreams, to let the dreams get to know one another. The fear is that we are going to hurt each other; we’re going to get overly psychological. But if we don’t intrude or we don’t impose or we don’t leverage dream, we can just simply listen to each other’s stories. People have been doing that for thousands and thousands of years. I think it’s a way of making contact. It’s a way of accessing imagination. It’s a way of guarding against the era of too much programmed information and too many video screens. When I watch my kids and others kids, they’re in screen time so much of the time that they (we) lose contact with the spontaneous imaginative process that is indigenous to each of us. If nothing else, talking dream opens up story and evokes imagination. I think it’s a wonderful thing to see the return of an interest in dreams and a return to an engagement with the dreaming psyche. ∞ </p>

<p><em>Jeanne Schul Elkins interviews Barry Williams at the Journey into Wholeness conference. (Part II of this interview appears in Volume 25 No. 3)</em></p>

<p><em>Barry Williams, M.Div., Psy.D., a Jungian analyst in private practice in Taos NM and Evanston IL, has had extensive experience in wilderness pursuits and experiential education, including eight years teaching with Outward Bound. He has a major interest in ritual forms that express the psyche’s participation in the archetypal wholeness which nature represents. He has been one of the leaders of the Temagami Vision Quest in Canada for 14 years.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne Elkins:</strong> Barry, one of the things you do is dream gathering. Could you talk about that? </p>

<p><strong>Barry Williams:</strong> Well, Jean, the idea of dream gathering came to me from something I’d seen done at an international conference. People would gather early in the morning to share dreams and sit in a spiral. What we’ve brought here is the idea that if we pay attention to the dreaming process of the community, that we’re creating a container that contains the unconscious. It ritually contains the unconscious process of the community even though we’re just doing a fragment, perhaps one-tenth of the people participating, each day. This is holographic. It suggests the whole. There is a perception ritually that this material has a place to go, and thus is not running amuck through projections in the community. It is as if the unconscious in the community feels that it is being heard. When the gathering of the dreams is without any commentary, or with only a sentence of commentary to locate the meaning of the dream, the community has the experience of being listened to deeply. I act as the ritual elder figure, the one figure who is receiving, holding and understanding this material, even if I don’t in fact understand the dream. Ritually it’s the experience of being understood. It’s part of what we’re trying to accomplish in the whole conference: a complete ceremonial cycle. To assure psyche is being listened to deeply. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Could you talk a little bit about that position you hold as ritual elder? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> I’m more of a ceremonial leader in a way, though I am not leading anything, exactly. There is a sense that someone has a foot in both worlds: in the waking, conference, relating, interpersonal world, and also a foot firmly in the dreaming unconscious, wild, natural world. A ritual elder is a bridging figure, someone who bridges between the gods and the mortal world, and someone who can travel back and forth between them. So listening to the dream, the message from the other world, and speaking to the dreamer in the same moment, connects the worlds together. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You also hold that space and talk about a safe container, and it’s felt by those of us in the room. Can you help us understand about how you create that safe container? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> That’s a mystery, really. The idea is that I cannot do anything. My biggest contribution to a community like this is to try to create a container that is strong and safe enough so that the archetypal energies can constellate within the group. If the container is held correctly, there can be the possibility of some transformation, of healing, or of people getting across thresholds in their lives. The dreams can emerge in an ever greater way, perhaps. The container is built on trust and understanding and the community feels it. The more we establish trust, the more the community feels it and the stronger the container. The stronger the container, the more trust, until we can be a community that’s sharing its deepest truth. That’s an extraordinary event. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Can you help us identify archetypal energy in our dream work? Sometimes you give feedback to the dreamer that you need to either pay attention to your dream or die. What are the red flags? Should we as the dreamers see the red flag ourselves? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What I often say about dreams is that they exist on multiple levels at once. There’s the very personal, the historical, familial, the social, cultural, and what we’re calling archetypal: the realm of the gods. In the dream groups, what I’m striving for is not to have a therapeutic result, but that the healing potential in these groups will come from paying attention— not exclusively—to the archetypal ground of the dream. My feeling in this kind of work and dream-focused community is that we can have lived a moment of the experience of the ‘Great Mind.’ This is what I often call the mind of Nature itself (referred to in many ways in dreaming: the mind of the dream, the dreammaker, the Self, God). I prefer to call it the Mind of Nature, because it is that which is completely natural in its totality which is communicating through or to us—that is rising to consciousness. I like to pay attention to trying to get us to have the lived moment of the experience of that mind which is pure meaning, because it’s really the totality of things as it tries to come into the human realm. If we do not pay attention to it, we cannot live. When I use dramatic language like, “get this, or it will kill you,” it’s not that dreams can kill, but if we do not hear this voice, we cannot live. By living, of course, I mean we’re not living our complete lives. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Often in dreams, animals manifest. Yesterday in the dream group work, the images of snakes and eggs showed up. Can you help us understand where we should go when we have animals appearing in our dreams? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> I think that the biggest mistake people can make, and often do make these days, is running to their animal symbol dictionary. I often counsel people to throw these dictionaries out. The best thing you can do to amplify the meaning of something is to understand what it is that this thing does. If we want to know about snakes, we need to think about snakes. What are snakes? How do they live? Where do they come from? What do they eat? What do they do in the seasons? etc. An indigenous person looks at an animal and knows everything about it: knows how it is, what it looks like, what it does every day of the year. The second thing to do is to understand any personal encounters. Maybe this person was bitten by a snake in childhood or had a traumatic encounter, or their mother was afraid of snakes. That would be crucial to know. Only then go to the cultural stories, and only then try to understand about meaning conceptually. If you read in the symbol dictionary that snake has qualities of this and that, then you’re starting to think about it. The snake or the animal in the dream, like the dream itself, has to have a kind of living presence in the discussion. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> So you’re approaching it from a much more intuitive level than an analytical level? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes. That’s one of my favorite topics, thank you. My thoughts about dreams are not so much that we bring our considerable intellectual tools to a dream to use them to amplify what we’re seeing or what we know. The idea is not to bring it out of its realm like an animal out of the wild into the zoo, but also to allow ourselves to be drawn into its reality. That’s why I’m talking about the living presence of the meaning field of the dream. This field is not intellectually experienced. It’s almost like we’re the problem the dream is trying to solve. Of course that’s just the opposite from the way most people think about it: that the dream is presenting us this cryptic puzzle that we need to dissect and understand. You can do that, certainly, but usually that understanding only goes so deep. We waste the opportunity of a dream remembered if we only use it to try and understand our own lives, really, because there’s that other quality to it: that the dream is a living being, virtually. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> So when you’re working on a dream, are you seeing it as images? Is it a being? Is it an image? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What I‘m looking for when I work on a dream is a subjective experience within me. I cannot teach a methodology about dream interpretation, I can only teach an attitude towards it, out of which would come a certain kind of methodology. If you teach a methodology, then you’re just getting a kind of cookie cutter assembly line. If you have the proper attitude, then the approach to the dream is quite different. What I look for in myself is an experience of an unfolding, that the meaning of it begins to rise up like the mist. It goes from static to alive. It’s possible this is my own ‘way,’ but it’s something that I can just feel. I feel it in every cell, the rightness and the meaningfulness of it. This is dangerously close to imposing my interpretation on the dream, but I try not to do that. I try to bring it out and let it be alive between us. When it’s alive between us, then we can watch and comment and not impose an interpretation. When you can feel that it’s alive and functioning— that you’re in the story, the dream has gripped hold of you—then the story comes alive in its meaningfulness. Meaning is always related to the energies of the Self. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> A lot of people dream about sex. One of the agendas that came up in the group dreamwork was a statement you made: Often in dreams, sex isn’t about sex, it’s about the life-force. Can you help us understand that? (mutual laughter) </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> What else do you say? Sex of course is a frequent motif in dreams, but in my experience, it’s rarely anything to do with sex, sexuality, or with genital sexuality. What is the purpose of genital sexuality? In human beings, of course, it is for the purpose of life. From the psyche’s point of view, that’s essentially the intention. New life, of course, is not a child. It’s the energies of two opposites brought together to make the whole that generates new life. This happens between individuals, and it also happens within the individual. When we’re dreaming of that the classic <em>conjunctio</em>, it is for the purpose of all possible kinds of new life and soul emergence. The classic example, of course, is a man dreams of a very seductive woman who is not his wife. In the dream he thinks, “I can’t do this, because this isn’t my wife.” This is all very well and good in outer life, but what is he neglecting to connect with in his inner life? There’s this thought that it’s not okay to do this because we have this thing called monogamy. From the psyche’s point of view, there’s an energy that needs to be addressed or that is addressing him, and it’s nothing to do with sex. It’s to do with the life-force itself. That is what really wants to be activated, to be expressed, to find a channel, to find a union, and wants to result in creation. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Along those lines, money is another issue that shows up. Your statement was, “Money is not about dollars.” </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Money is never about dollars in dreams. The dream doesn’t care how well off we are in life, it only cares about how much energy, how much “where-with-all” we have. Money dreams are more often images of the life force, libido, flow, fire, of spirit. Can we be a player in life? It’s not about consuming and purchasing and paying the bills. It’s about what we have available to us. The psychic world is about reciprocity and not about capitalism. Can we pay our way? Do we have enough? Are we impoverished? In other words, do we have enough to make the world happen around us and pay our way reciprocally with the other world? </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You often use the expression that the dreams are dreaming us. That’s thick. </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> That’s a hard one. Well, Many, many people have the experience—at least occasionally, or once in their lives—of being the one who is moved. Sometimes in meditation, people will have the experience of being breathed. I have a friend who is a runner who says that something is running him. It really is the presence of the Self. One of the great notions in working with the unconscious is the experience of what Jung calls the relativization of the ego. The ego, the individual, suddenly experiences that s/he is not the master in her/his own house. You’re living in someone else’s house and that you are the moved to the mover. You would never say, “I created this dream,” or “This is my dream.” I/you/ego could not have created any dream in a million years. It’s impossible. It’s this great mind—or all of nature, the gods themselves—who are thinking and creating in this way. This is the way the Self thinks. We are the creation of this thought process. Most people think that you do something and then you dream about it. Sometimes it appears that way chronologically, but it’s probably the other way around. What we’re doing is what we’ve already dreamed or what is dreaming us. What we call our waking reality is the infinite variables of life coming together like the weather—virtually—in a single moment of what we’re calling reality, which is totally over-determined by the unconscious process. So in that way we are dreamed into being. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> You often warn us that when we are about to tell a dream, we are going to be telling everyone what we know least about ourselves. </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, dreams emerge from the unconscious. I always love the anecdote about Jung when he says apparently in some frustration, “You have to remember that what’s unconscious is unconscious.” In other words, it’s unknown. There’s only a small bit of the personal unconscious that we can actually make conscious. The rest is unconscious. It’s unknowable. When a person has a dream, it’s the unknown that is emerging toward consciousness. A nice point about dreaming is that by the time you’re dreaming of something, it’s well on its way to consciousness. It’s when you’re not dreaming of it that it’s running you unconsciously. If you’re dreaming about it, it’s on its way towards consciousness and that’s when you can bring it out and learn a little bit. So if a person tells a dream in a group, by definition he or she is saying what they don’t know about themselves. Thus it’s a very fragile offering and needs to be respected as such. That’s why I caution people that it’s not hunting season—it’s not open season on the dreamer. They’re not fair game for your projections, because it’s a very delicate, fragile, vulnerable place in which they’ve put themselves. They’re offering something that’s unique and beautiful which deserves and needs to be deeply respected. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Barry, can you talk a bit about your process of working with dreams in your professional practice? BW. Rather than me being the guide of the process, I’m letting the unconscious, the dreams, largely be the guide in terms of what we discuss. All the great motifs will be there. Over a long period of time, if the person can be related to this magnificent fabric of meaning that contains their personal lives—and at the same time displays all of the wonders of heaven, as it were—then this lends tremendous dignity and depth. That’s where the healing can come from. Jung was very clear on that. So in other words, when the archetypal worlds manifest through the dreams—and I believe that’s the way a person can connect with it—then the emotional result around that is healing. It’s the emotion that one experiences in the body that infuses the person, the whole selfhood of the person, with the transpersonal energies of the archetypal world. When that happens, each in its unique way, then lives can be changed. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Can you talk to us about those dreams that are so visceral that we wake up feeling physically the person we were carrying or where our hand just was… a kind of belief that it really did happen? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> It really did just happen. (laughter) </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Those are the dreams that we’re drawn into deeply. The attempt of the dreamer upon waking is often to get away from that. “Let me separate from that reality.” But the point is that the dream had you.... it was having you, as if it put you to sleep to have you. In some of those moments, you’re completely enmeshed in the reality of that world and it’s hard to return or to move out into ordinary consciousness again, because the energy of the meaning of the dream, for whatever reason, is extremely strong at that point. It’s really got you. It’s hooked you. These are special dreams. They are the ones that leave trails behind them in your life and are to be respected and given full attention. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Where does one go with those dreams other than to an analyst? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> It’s a great question. To an analyst, of course. The analyst is not only the one who can try to help you understand these things, but then also becomes a kind of initiating elder. When great dreams announce the journey you’re undertaking, you need to have a guide, because it’s an initiatory journey. Initiation is an archetypal pattern that always requires a death through an ordeal and a rebirth of some sort. Of course lots of people analytically think, “Give me the rebirth. Give me the new life. I can’t wait,” and they forget that there’s a death required, which is often, if not always, excruciating. Death is death. It’s hard to let go of an old pattern, an old identity, an old history, the old drama, the old story, the old way of being, or the old vocabulary. It is very humbling because you can see how the psyche is trying, in the absence of a cultural initiation pattern, to initiate the dreaming person. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Do you see a pattern with time of life, with people who come to see you when these kinds of dreams erupt? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> One of my favorite things in the last couple of years is to work with some young men and women who have gone to northern Hudson Bay on expeditions to encounter the Grandfather of the North. This is the place in many traditions where dreams come from and a great place of wisdom. I sit with them on their last campsite and listen to their dreams. This is a lost age group. They’re leaving adolescence and trying to emerge into young adulthood. The educational system and the government, the family and the culture—everybody is saying something—but what is the real pathway to the authentic life? A lot of people lose their way at this point. They decide to do something that seems okay, but it might not be well supported from the unconscious, and they will burn out at some point. I liken it to this: in the Pueblo world of the southwest, when the masked gods or the dancers enter the plaza (because these are archetypal figures... they’re not human beings any more) the ritual leader of the ceremony lays down a pathway on the ground for them, often of corn pollen or cornmeal, to walk on. I think youngsters’ dreams are like that. These are like the pollen pathways for them. If they can hear them, the dreams will open the pathway into their lives. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> There seems to be a lack of any form of initiation at any change of life in our culture. I’m wondering if dreams... </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> The answer if yes! Absolutely. Absent a cultural container for these rights of passage, it’s up to the psyche, really, to do it. Good ritual is about aligning the individual psyche with Nature and the Nature’s way. When these are aligned, then you’re doing something, often culturally... as it was in the beginning. The way it was in the beginning is the pure way of the psyche. If we no longer have this, and what’s worse, if we’ve lost our access to it, the psyche will still be going ahead with its attempts at alignment. It can feel crazy-making. If a person were part of a group that had done an initiatory process at an age-appropriate time, it would be a tremendous experience. When they’re doing it by themselves in the midst of a social environment that doesn’t support it, it can be quite difficult. You can see vestiges of rituals gone terribly awry in the acting out behavior of adolescents, gangs and so forth. The point is, in the classic initiatory pattern the ordeal is for the purpose of moving out of the old place and getting into a place where you can be connected to what we’ll call the archetypal realm. If we don’t do that in our lives, if we have lost the connection to the source-place of that realm, then we don’t know how to live. We get lost. In the Plains culture, a person without a vision is not a human being. They’re just people living their lives, but they’re not a real human being. </p>

<p><strong>JE:</strong> Do we have permission to not necessarily understand our dreams as long as we sit with it or go back to it? </p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> At the very least, pay attention. Acknowledge that the dream world does exist, that it is communicating with you. Write your dreams down You can draw them, paint them, sculpt them, dance them, do active imagination with them, sit with them, meditate on them. Just let them infuse you—even if you don’t understand them—because it’s usually not something you can get with your mind, in so many words anyway. At the very least, live with the knowledge that this process is going on. One of the techniques I use is to imagine we’re camped by a great river and it’s flowing by all the time, day and night, day after day, year after year, millennia upon millennia. From time to time we go down and dip our cup into it and drink from it, or use it to cook our meals, or bathe in it, or take and use the water for our crops. It’s only from time to time we go to the river; meanwhile it is powerfully flowing by... all the time. ℘</p>

<p><em>Jeanne Schul Elkins interviews Barry Williams at the Journey into Wholeness conference. (Part I of this interview appeared in Volume 24 No. 1)</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Can you give us some insight into the spiritual practice in which you participate and maybe an idea of how you deal with your own dreams?</p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I’ve kept a dream journal since 1970 and I don’t think I got into analysis until much later than that. Just the mere writing down of dreams is its own discipline, because then that world is being noticed, held, recorded, reflected on. There’s a great phrase: “The face you turn towards the unconscious is the face that it turns towards you.” So, if you’re turning towards it with respect, curiosity, in an invocational way, it will respond. It’s like any relationship; if you don’t call the person up, you won’t get to know them. They won’t pick up the phone. Or if you call and don’t say anything, they’ll just hang up. So it’s in the writing it down. I write down my dreams, of course, when I have them. I keep journals, a bookshelf full of them, and will really reflect on them. In my own life, I’ve had an interesting situation in my family some years ago that the medical world didn’t seem to be able to address. I really felt I had to put my money where my mouth was; dreams really help us through this. In fact, the dreams were more than helpful in finding the meaning and the purpose of the great dream of the birth of this child. In fact, it gave me my life. Had that not happened and had I not followed the dream—the inner understanding of this—I would have missed its meaning, as if the whole experience was the great dream. Even before the child was born, we had any number of very, very powerful dreams, which we were only able to decipher many years later, but that fell into a very visible pattern once we got it. So if I had not been true to myself and to my discipline, so to speak, I would have missed what was trying to, like a great dream, come into being. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Could you talk about the issue of voices in our dreams? What’s going on when we hear a very distinct voice in our dreams as we awaken? </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well, the dream thinks in images. We can’t think about a dream easily because the dream thinks in a different paradigm. So if a dream is thinking in images, then as something comes closer to consciousness, it might be personified, that something that is unimaginable takes on an imaginal quality as, say, snake, deer, horse, dog, monkey, human, in a kind of progression; and as it moves closer to consciousness, it becomes more and more personified. So a voice would be a message that—in order to be received—has to be put into, not a personified image, but a voiced image, as it were. So the meaning takes on a voice, and literally becomes the message. Not all dreams are images, of course. You can have dreams of kinesthetic senses. Sometimes people have tastes. In one of the most beautiful dreams I ever heard, the dreamer woke up with a taste of honey. Imagine. All of nature goes into this dream. Where does honey come from? It’s the transformed pollen. What is pollen? Pollen is the great, secret, growing world. It’s like the distilled essence of all of life was on the tongue of the dreamer. And, so, that’s hardly an image. It was a literal taste. Sometimes it’s a sound, sometimes a smell, sometimes a touch, sometimes, a voice.</p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Considering typology, an idea that really strikes me is the concept that we connect with the Divine or the Self through our interior function. In some dreams, I wake up and feel sensations sometimes as terrifyingly real. I often wonder why I don’t hear other people talking about feeling or smelling or experiencing the dream’s embrace as though it actually just happened. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well, what’s unconscious is unconscious. So, that’s an example of the dream coming through your least differentiated awareness. Even though you’re a dancer and you use your body and have quite a kinesthetic feel for life, apparently. Nevertheless, the dream comes through your inferior function, in the example you just gave. And so it would give you that sense of distance and incomprehension. But an immediacy, like: “Woo, this is what I really don’t know” and probably has a purposefulness in that. It gets your attention. You would never say, “Oh, I get that. It’s my usual mode.” You say, “Oh my God, this is so distant from me. How do I possibly understand it?” And that’s how you have to go work on it. It’s the portal to the unconscious world. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I understand it intellectually, but it is my experience that intuition is not supported by the world in which we live and is often discounted; as in, “It’s just a dream.” I’m confused about how we can go about living into the dream. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> One of the great problems for people is (and almost everyone asks this): “What do I do with this dream?” My advice is always, “We’re doing it.” It’s by talking about it. It’s by deepening into it. It’s by feeling it, letting it work us. That’s the process. We always think we want or we should bring the dream out into our lives and change our behavior and make ourselves a better person because of it. I don’t know if that’s wrong, or even misguided, but I’m never sure that that’s very helpful. Because there’s an inner process that’s going on and it’s our job to relate to that—to relate our lives to the inner process—not to bring the inner process out to make ourselves better people necessarily. Of course, so saying, you can always think of examples of dreams that give you a heads up. “You’re living in the wrong way.” Or “Pay attention to this or that.” Or “You don’t realize how much you love your child.” You can have a kind of Scrooge on Christmas morning experience through that and you sort of get it all in one night. In general, it’s the deep process that you’re trying to relate to. Again, not that we should bring that out into our waking world to have it, but to <em>allow ourselves to be had by it</em>, so that we’re aligning and attuning to it in some way. </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The way that I came to dreamwork was literally waking up with horrific nightmares that were screaming for my attention. When I was completely electrified in the middle of the night, my response was to dive out of bed, retreat to my study, curl up with my journal, and write it down. My thirty years of journaling truly served me well. I needed to do something with all of those images. I couldn’t just make them go away. They were very visceral. I was feeling the dream in every part of my body. I think it’s that kind of urgency that, for some of us, makes dreaming suddenly significant. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> The word “suddenly” is very important. In fairy tales, often there will be a situation in which everything is just fine. There is the mother and the two wonderful daughters. Everybody loves everybody and the world loves them. “Suddenly” there is a knock at the door. There is the inbreaking of the conscious situation that needs to unfold itself in the life that these people need to pay attention to. Even the use of the word is like that knock on the door. “Suddenly” you need to pay attention to this in a big way. The dreams have this tremendous energy, tremendous valiancy to them, and you cannot do anything except open that door. What good does it do you to hide? Right? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes. It’s not possible. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> But it’s unthinkable to open the door. It’s way too much. And so there you are. You’re caught in this kind of existential moment of: “Damned if you do. Damned if you don’t.” But, in fact, you’re probably damned if you don’t and blessed if you do. In the fairy tales, almost always, when that in-breaking happens, it’s: “Suddenly” something happens. It’s the use of that word. It’s not “and then something happens.” This can be in the nature of a calling, too. Naturally, we get the word vocation from <em>vocare</em>, meaning to call. Many dreams that happen in the way you are describing are a kind of calling. It’s calling you to your life, really. Not away from your life, but calling you to your life, to your deep life: to be who you most inwardly are. That can be wrenching, if you’re not being very close to who you inwardly are. However, that’s the initiatory function. Classic vocational dreams can be quite dramatic: getting knocked off your horse on the way to Damascus and everything in between. It’s when the Self or God is calling to you. You can hear it as a voice. You can experience it as a traumatic dream. Ideally, our vocation in life is our calling from the Self. Again, it’s the image of alignment with that path wherever it should take you: down to purgatory or hell ala Dante. Still, that’s the path to life led through hell: to go deeply into what it is that is happening to you, as a result of who you are and what you’ve experienced and the psychological patterns that are dreaming you or having you, that want you — in a way — in a manner of speaking.</p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I‘ve certainly had dreams in which images or ideas or words showed up that I didn’t have a handle on, that seemed to hold a much bigger presence. Once, I dreamed of being at the Oracle of Delphi. I bowed to the Oracle and asked: “What is my path?” And the voice echoed back: “She who dances us into being.” </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> And what’s your experience of that? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It scares the hell out of me. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> So there’s some awe? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> A great deal of awe. It’s shocking, actually. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What is shocking about it? </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I think it’s the closeness to divine presence or energy. </p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> The Great Life. The great reality of that world encounters you. One of the great religious experiences is of being addressed by “Otherness.” Not that we go out and seek it and knock at its door and pull at its hem, but that it turns towards us and addresses us. How do you contain that in the seemingly small life of one’s own ego identity? But that’s the task. So there’s that awe and even terror, but the dawning realization, hopefully over time if you can contain this, of the great life; that your life somehow is attended by and connected to these energies. It’s a short step into some theological considerations here. The theology of God or the gods reaching out to the mortal world and that God or the gods are completed by the human experience or reflect or are the reflective part of the godhead; and, so, to experience the reality of that—the reality of the psyche in which this is happening from an inward place—is the meaning of life. We can’t live life without making that connection. Another way to talk about that, of course, is alchemically. It’s another paradigm to use. There are many paradigms. Some of the great experiences are of that world reaching out to us, whether it’s the divine realm or the Anima or Animus figure reaching out to the dreamer. It wants connection with you. Another way to put that is: Imagine that there is a process going on in us that wants to hammer us into gold or wants to transform us into gold, so that it can turn itself into hammered gold. That’s the image I was having. It wants to take us from the untransformed and undifferentiated to the most highly transformed and differentiated. It’s constantly attempting to enact itself in us if we will but listen. Sometimes, like with you, it breaks right through, powerfully, terrifyingly, and demands our attention. Its purpose, ultimately, is to make gold. We can’t do that all at once. It’s a lifetime process, really only complete with our last breath. But if we do not do it, we are not living our lives. It’s how we began initially: “If you don’t pay attention, it will kill you;” meaning if you don’t pay attention to the process that wants you to participate with it, you will not live your authentic life. You can only know what your authentic life is, not from achieving the highest success in your field, but by truly living out your vocation, that which is calling you. Hopefully, there is a wonderful parallel of success in real life, however you measure that, with a deep sense of fulfillment. One is always respectful of Jung’s last dream where the gold was in amongst the roots of the great tree.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Jill Gregory</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Jill, what excites you the most about dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What interests me is their potential for transforming how we experience life; what we believe and think, how we feel and what we do with our lives. Dreaming gives us an alternate world to explore which functions according to related and yet different laws. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> When did you first become involved in dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> My involvement with dreams began with a nightmare I had when I was four years old. In waking life, while he was driving, my father always used to run a car wheel off the shoulder of the road and it would terrify me. I thought we would go off into the marsh. In the dream I'm in the car with my parents. My father's driving, my mother's in the front seat and I'm in the back seat. In the dream that's what happens. We go off into the marsh and the car starts sinking. I wake up as the mud is going into my nose, ears and eyes. After my parents and I had responded to the dream the best that we knew how, I was still gripped with terror when I reentered my bedroom to return to sleep. I knew that we had not resolved the dream. I vowed that I would find out the connection between waking and dream reality.</p>

<p>This launched countless experiments testing theories that I had encountered. Many years of frustration and ignorant effort finally gave way to a breakthrough which occurred during a dream joumaling and analysis assignment for class while I was studying philosophy and creative writing. I connected a few dreams to issues in my waking life and began to get some progress in my dreamwork. From that point on I studied everything I could get my hands on and tried to apply what I learned to my dreamlife. That took me through Gestalt, defining symbols, finding puns and making associations to symbols, noticing compensation, archetypes and mandala imagery. I attended seminars and did dream reenactment, took workshops and expressed my dreams artistically. </p>

<p>It was in Ken Keizer's Gestalt group, when I was 27 years old, that I finally worked on my four year old dream. I discovered that the child felt helpless, was afraid of dying and afraid of going to hell. Being "saved" didn't help because I still lost out on life. My four year old self didn't trust her parents or God. When I finally allowed myself to die, I found that it was okay and the energy from that dream was released. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> At what point did you become interested in lucid dreaming? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> About 10 years ago. I had been working with Senoi methods of within-the-dream dreamwork without actual lucidity. I had also been refining my recall, not only to increase the number of dreams I could remember a night, but also to improve my ability to observe the dream scene, to bring back exact shades of colors, numbers of individuals, and estimates of distance and size. With more dreams and details from each dream I was spending two to three hours just recording. I was ready for a new goal for my dream life. </p>

<p>I had no idea lucid dreaming was possible until I read Ann Faraday's book, <em>Dream Power</em>. I got very excited, expecting it would start happening right away, but it didn't. It took three months until I had my first lucid dream. That dream forecast how rich, wonderful and nurturing the discovery of lucid dreaming was going to prove in my dream life and in my waking life. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> It impresses me that you could go out and find an academic curriculum that would allow you to write a thesis with such an extensive bibliography on lucid dreaming for your B.A. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> It was tough. I had to pull a few strings to obtain a thesis advisor who would let me do it the way I wanted. Since there were no lucid dreamers on the staff of the psychology department at Dominican College at the time, I was very fortunate that Bob Shukraft, head of the department, agreed to advise me and trusted my judgment. I spent two years of energy and attention putting together the thesis, entitled, "Becoming a Lucid Dreamer." </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Was it then that you started to become more aware of the larger dream community? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Somehow my confidence, probably through dreaming and a lot of other things, was raised enough that I went to the 1985 ASD conference as a panel presenter at the lucid dreaming symposium. Fred Olsen and I met at the conference and through him I apprenticed in reentry and reimaging and attended the first meeting of the San Francisco Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers' Group. </p>

<p>That group gave me the idea that a career in dreams was possible and that, with the support of the network, I could do it. So I opened the Novato Center for Dreams (NCD) in January of this past year and launched an official professional dreamwork career including interviewing for <em>Dream Network Bulletin.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What services does your Center offer? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> The Center serves as a resource for a wide range of people, from those who have just begun to ask questions about dreams to those training for a dreamwork career or preparing to launch a dream center. I offer classes, workshops and lectures on how to develop dreamskills. We cover areas such as recall, types of dreams, journaling,dream-sharing, interpretive and non-interpretive methods of dreamwork/dreamplay, incubation and lucidity, healing dreams and flying dreams. I lead dream sharing groups. As an outreach I offer private tutoring by phone as well as in person. The Center's browsing library has over 110 books on dreams and information on dream events and resources. I display and sell dream based art and distribute my packets of "Tips for Dreamers." </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your goals for the Center? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> My overall goals involve promoting awareness and appreciation of dreams, dispelling erroneous myths and educating dreamers. The hard thing, I'm finding, is the marketing. Basically I think it's a lack of startup capital combined with a lack of practice doing it. But I think when this becomes more mainstream it won't be as much of a problem, because I think what we're doing is something that has a lot of interest and support. It's just pitifully underpublicized and that's tragic. I want to change that. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> How would you characterize your style of dreamwork?</p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Well, the worn out word "eclectic" comes to mind. I like the experiences of group style dreamwork, such as acting out the whole dream and getting group feedback. But I care most about developing individualized dreamwork methods and teaching those to people because when a person wakes up, generally there is no group available. I'm very interested in developing dreamwork methods, pulling potent elements from different methods and bringing them together in a quick and flexible layout. The main thing in terms of feeling good about yourself as a dreamer is having a bulging repertoire of dreamwork methods that you can tap into as you see fit. </p>

<p>I see myself as a coach for dreamers. I ask, what is happening in your dream life right now? What has happened before? What would you like to have happen in the future? Then I present a variety of dreamwork methods-to me that's very important. I can suggest 50 techniques and 50 great goals, but often, by doing that, they'll come up with goal 51 and technique 51 that are really tailored for them. So I encourage dreamers to come up with their version of what they really want. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your views about the dreamwork field in general? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I see it as a vulnerable new movement which will strengthen because it bears valuable gifts and because everyone has a dreamlife of one sort or another. I think it's very important right now in the dream movement for researchers and avid dreamers and dream workers to be open-minded about dreams. It's a typical human fallacy to try to reduce things to fit into various frameworks. We need to really be open because we don't know. We are a very young field despite the fact that we're a very old field, because we haven't examined millions of dream journals from age two or three on, of various cross sections from different cultures and historical periods. We don't have that data base. Therefore we really don't know. So go with what feels right for you as the dreamer and don't Jet whatever is currently being discussed - this new theory; that new theory - try to set it. Stay with your own dreams and what feels right for you.</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Any last advice for dreamers or dreamworkers? </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> If there's anything that I have to offer it's that dream skills can be learned just like you take lessons to learn how to swim or play a violin. I believe that we all have incredible and quite highly developed dream lives in toddlerhood and before we're even born. It gets knocked out of us by the socialization process. </p>

<p>By doing dreamwork, we're not bringing in something artificial to mess up our lives. The mess was getting cut off from our dreams in the first place. We're just going back to something that was natural. Dreams are a natural healing function that is one of the gifts of being human. We're lucky we've got them. I wouldn't want to live without my dreams.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Jane Roberts' Seth material advocates a participant/observer mode of dream research which requires that a dreamworker be adept at <em>in-dream</em> skills. Being a dream-art scientist requires the development of specific talents. To become aware that one is dreaming, to lucid dream, is a prerequisite. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"... A practitioner of this ancient art learns first of all how to become conscious in normal terms, while in the sleep state. Then he becomes sensitive to the different subjective alterations that occur when dreams begin, happen, and end."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucidity includes the experience of hypnogogia, imageJess dreams, out-of-body and initial wakening states, mental and auditory dream periods, and other dream states which have yet to find commonly accepted names. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"He familiarizes himself with the symbolism of his own dreams..."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sethian lucid dreamers don't have to wait until waking to understand a dream symbol, they can ask while in the dream state. "Who are you?" "What do you represent?" "What message have you for me?" </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...and sees how these do or do not correlate with the exterior symbols that appear in the waking life he shares with others."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dream dictionaries become inappropriate to the Sethian who realizes that the meaning of her own dream symbols are primarily personal in nature, and furthermore, that they change over time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"There are inner meeting places, then, interior 'places' that serve as points of inner commerce and communication... Our dream-art scientist learns to recognize such points of correlation."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondarily, symbols can serve as correlating elements between dreamers, providing evidence for mutual dreaming and shared life issues. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...he or she then begins to recognize the fact of involvement with many different levels and kinds of reality and activity. He must learn to isolate these, separate one from the other, and then try to understand the laws that govern them."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a level of dreaming in which, for example, it is not possible to go through walls because one's body sense is too dense, too close to the waking state? </p>

<p><em>Dr. Bud Harris is a practicing Jungian analyst in Asheville, N.C. He has over 35 years experience as a psychotherapist, psychologist and Jungian analyst. Dr. Harris has a Ph.D. in counseling psychology and is a graduate of the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzerland. You may learn more about Dr. Harris on his website <a href="https://www.budharris.com/">www.budharris.com</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne Schul:</strong> I’d like to start by giving the readership a sense of your work. You’ve got a fairly new book out, <em>The Fire and the Rose: The Wedding of Spirituality and Sexuality</em>. But you’ve got another that has been re-released, right? </p>

<p><strong>Bud Harris:</strong> That book is <em>Resurrecting the Unicorn</em>: Masculinity in the 21st Century* and it grew out of my thesis in Zurich. I began by working with a fairy tale and working through my own mother complex. This process evolved into an image of masculine energy that is viable, energizing and rewarding for me. That turned into a book. Interestingly enough, writing the book became the preparation for my exams. </p>

<p>The whole thing, in my mind, came from the Self originally and basically carried me through the whole program of becoming a Jungian analyst. I was talking to Aniella Jaffe about it one time and she was telling me how my Anima was involved in that, how my Anima had given me the outline of the book and how I needed to pay attention to that. So what I have done since that time is to try to listen carefully to my own inner voices and all of my books, I believe, have evolved from the Self as it wanted me to work through and develop an issue in my own life. </p>

<p>If we delve deeply enough into ourselves, we come to a common stream with other people and our work begins to ripple out and help more people in concert. My teaching focuses around the same thing. I don’t pick my topics, my topics pick me. </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> So, you work with a very organic approach.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, but it takes a real strong effort on the part of my ego not to interfere with that process, because I have a strong and aggressive ego. I was a businessman and a college professor for a while. If I start letting those things grab hold of my creative work, then I start to lose the depth connection to it. For example, in <em>Resurrecting the Unicorn</em> there is a chapter on the Father, which led to my next book, <em>The Father Quest</em>.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> One thing that I’m wondering about, as I think of you working from the inside out, is this question: how do you arrive at the sense of self-knowledge that your Anima is giving you in the chapters to a book?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I get there by listening and that means I have to be fierce enough to give myself time to listen; but if I’m not, I’ve worked enough with my unconscious to know it will get rowdy. In the first newsletter on my website, I tell about how I fell out of bed one night and hit my head... and that was my unconscious getting rowdy and telling me I had stopped listening and that I’d better start listening to my inner voices. I listen to my Anima and my Self best by journaling. I describe that process in my book, <em>Sacred Selfishness</em>; in fact, I have a whole chapter on that because it’s so very important. Of course there are a number of different ways you can journal: you can keep a diary or you can perseverate on whatever feelings you’re stuck in. What I want to do is look at the events in my day, the emotions that they brought up in me and really take time with them. I see the journal as an exercise in listening and in self-understanding. It’s very important and dynamic. I keep dreams mixed right in with the whole thing. Active Imagination is very beneficial. I get a lot of information from the inner voice through active imagination. And I’ll admit, ultimately, that Active Imagination was the hardest thing in Jungian psychology for me to get into. It took years of effort because I had all the defenses that everybody has. I thought: I’m just making this up. This is silly. But once I crossed that barrier, it has been invaluable to me.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> I’m wondering how your dreams play into that because in one of your books, befriending the dream is the closure to each of your sections, where you talk the reader through how to work with a dream or listen to them while you’re digesting the material. Can you give us a sense of how active imagination works for you or what you recommend when working a dream?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Active imagination supports dreamwork for me after I have spent a significant amount of time with the dream: frequently just sitting with the dream, sitting with the images, sitting with the feelings, sitting with the landscape. James Hillman’s work helped me a lot with my thinking about this. I believe it’s so important to let the images live and develop before I start pursuing them with active imagination. It’s as if I’m getting to know them and getting to experience them as a part of me. Then, when I start Active Imagination with the dream image, I have developed a relationship with it. That’s Eros. Developing a relationship with a dream and its images is Eros; whereas analyzing it is Logos. I want to err on the side of Eros.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> It’s a very different frame in our culture. It’s not the usual masculine approach, I don’t think.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> What I’m going to talk about in my next lecture on complexes is how we always approach complexes from the position of Mars. We want to attack them, we want to overcome them, we want them banished, we want to fight them, we want to win; we lose sight of the fact that we are creating a war within ourselves. Whereas, when we approach them with Eros, it doesn’t mean we embrace them; but it means we get to know them before we try to decide whether we need to be aggressive with them or not.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> What can you tell us about the creative aspect of dreaming that you’ve experienced or witnessed?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Dreams are always creative. They offer us the other side of the picture of how we are living <em>that we don’t want to see</em> and part of creativity is to challenge our conventional, normal perspectives. Dreams are meant to show us a reality that’s beyond what we think reality is. I’m very appreciative of that. Dreams connect us to the archetypes, as well. If we pursue or engage with the archetypes, that too will lead us to creative fountains beyond what we normally experience. Artists in their own way have channels to their creativity and, in some cases, to the archetypes. It’s a way to bring these things into being, to encounter the paradoxes in our lives even if it doesn’t necessarily make our egos any more conscious.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Could you speak to those dreams of animals visiting us or specifically the snake images that you continue to explore in your books.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I love the image of snakes! It always reminds me of Joseph Campbell talking about snakes on a video series with Bill Moyers. He talks about how every mythology in the world involving the fall of humankind involves a snake; he says “Snake did it,” every time! I think that snakes almost always call for transformation on a very basic, instinctual level, which always means at the level of the Self coming out... and this means it’s going to be very threatening to the ego. Also, snakes call for healing; when we repress transformation and deny our healing, then we may get threatening snake dreams. We can be in a snake pit. I think animals generally appear to tell us as something about our instinctual self, as you probably know.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> You talk about serpent energy as the desire and the longing for transformation.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I begin the focus in my book on our culture, speaking to the place where advertising and marketing stimulates our desire for products and enchants us into a false life. In addition—in terms of cultural mores— the Calvinistic cloud that covers us all causes us to blindly repress many desires and eventually these can get us into trouble. But there is Serpent energy woven into all of our desires: Kundalini energy that is pushing for transformation, whether it’s conscious or not. Our desire, in general, whether it’s sacred or profane, Celestial Aphrodite or Aphrodite Pandemos, is meant to serve life. With the help of our increasing consciousness and our courage to experience it fully, it can evolve into a pursuit that will help us enlarge our lives, enlarge ourselves. Eventually, it can help us overcome demons in our personality and the limits of our own ego, which in turn, helps us experience the abundance of the Self.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> What kind of practice do you recommend to make that switch from the kind of primeval, primitive energy to a more conscious partnership with this Serpent energy?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> The first thing I recommend is to be fully engaged in life, which most of us aren’t. We hold back because we don’t want to make mistakes, we don’t want to be embarrassed, we don’t want to be ashamed. Personally, I would say first priority is to be fully engaged in life. The second thing is to begin to reflect on that life. If you’re not engaged, really there’s not that much to reflect on other than our malaise. My spiritual practices are journaling, turning to images from dreams and their stories, and Active Imagination. That’s what I do. That’s the second step. The third step is to take the results of that reflection and integrate it into your life as you’re living it.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> That’s the difficult part for most people.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> All too often—even in self-help books and psychological teachings— it’s mostly about the inside. We think that’s the end of it and we can live happily ever after. Well, the hard part comes next when we have to integrate it into our lives.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> I’m thinking of Robert Johnson’s approach to working with Active Imagination and one thing he stresses is <em>don’t act this out.</em> In other words, if you’re working with shadow material and you get in touch with it, you don’t want to rush out and do whatever it is you realize you want to do. So how do you suggest negotiating that, not acting out the shadow material but living into your dreams or living into the passionate engagement?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Well acting it out is just compulsively doing something. It’s not integrating it because, to me, integrating means giving it conscious consideration and using it to expand your personality, then deciding how you’re going to use it in your life. For example, I get in touch with my anger. I was always taught to be a good boy and I found I backed up a lot of rage. I don’t want to go out and act out that rage. What I do want to do is work through the rage in my journal and active imagination and come to understand that anger has a positive side. It tells me when my boundaries have been violated. It tells me when I need to stand up for myself and when my situation needs to change. And I need to use it to fuel how I deal with these situations consciously, not unconsciously. I don’t need to go out and lose my temper. I need to learn how to be consciously angry and to even feel empowered by that.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Sometimes, as I’m writing my dreams, it simply morphs into poetic form. Do you have any experience with this practice of writing poetry that grows out of dreams? I know that you talk a great deal about the poetic aspect of dreams.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> I love poetry. It’s very expressive... another way of forging a bridge between our ego and the depth of our inner world. I believe our inner world speaks to all of us who are willing to listen. If it comes out that way—if that’s the way your inner muse wants to be expressed—I would simply do it that way. Follow your muse.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> It is another way of creatively working with dreams.  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes. Most of all we are in a creative quest for silence. My wife and I are always pushing to have less busyness and less noise in our life. That doesn’t mean less work, but less of just the chatter of the world: fewer newspapers, less TV. The quietness invites the inner voice to be heard.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> One aspect of dreaming that holds a lot of interest for me is the voice in dreams. In <em>Man and his Symbols</em>, Jung is quoted as saying that you must attend the voices you hear in a dream. You can’t deny it. Often, I wake up with is just a powerful statement and it’s all I have of the dream. The voice echoes back years and years later. Do you have any strong feelings about specific voices in dreams?  </p>

<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, if we’re just writing the plot, we are really dishonoring the dream. We need to pay attention to it by looking at it seriously and tending our reflections on it. In terms of the voice, I would agree with Jung. If I hear a voice in a dream, you can bet I’m going to attend to it. That doesn’t mean I’m going to obey it, but I’m going to attend to it. I’m going to listen to it and I’m going to try to discern from whence it came. I might engage it in active imagination; I will take it very seriously. You may remember that at one point Jung had a dream in which he heard the voice of a woman telling him he should give up psychiatry and go to Paris and be an artist. He confronted that voice. He attended to it very seriously... but he didn’t obey it. That was the time when he was working on his Anima. He was struggling through a very dark period which is now revealed in the Red Book.  </p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> Now that we have access to the Red Book, it affords us all the opportunity to witness Jung’s visual explorations of his dreams and his approach to Active Imagination. Thank you, Dr. Harris, for sharing your personal experience with dreams, as well as your expertise. I look forward to further conversations with you on this topic. ∞ </p>

<p>Want to go on a trip?</p>

<p>This one will take you places you don't expect to go, some of them imaginary (maybe) some of them real (but unusual) and others ordinary (but experienced in an unusual way).</p>

<p>Martone's book is probably at least a bit autobiographical, as the author, and the main character share a similar name (the protagonist is Kate), both are Jungian therapists, lived in Colorado, and now live in Arkansas, have red hair and an interest in shamanic journeys.</p>

<p>The book unfolds almost like a lucid dream. In one moment the reader is grounded in the day to day details of preparing a meal, dressing to visit with friends, snuggling with lovable kitties in an elegant Victorian home or painting in a studio in a small town in Arkansas. The next you are in a conversation with a giant man in white robes with glowing golden eyes who rides on Pegasus and loves our heroine on seemingly all levels at once: a father, a grandfather, a lover, a friend and adviser.</p>

<p>Kate has come to live in a quaint 1800s small town in Arkansas following a failed relationship in Colorado. She is looking to reinvent her life through her interest in dreams, her artwork, her friends and even a trek to Tibet that has her hiking through dangerous mountains, and experiencing a ceremonial rebirth accomplished via the circling of one sacred mountain.</p>

<p>Seemingly out of nowhere, Kate is experiencing doors shutting in her face: friends disconnecting, her art, once popular, no longer selling, her dream work group has ejected her. As we travel with her through her ups and downs, her attempts to make sense of her life, loves, losses and choices we also begin to understand that Kate's family history is far from happy, and through both her experiences and the gentle prodding of her - possibly imaginary - friend, "Grandfather," we begin to understand what has brought Kate to her present state, and what she will need to do to find her way back out of the dream.</p>

<p>The book reads comfortably, like a conversation that, if sometimes painful, is told with the detailed confidences of a good friend sharing both the mundane and the most dramatic moments of her life as she sorts them out with us, and at the same time shares her methods of coping with, and investigating, a complex inner life.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The <a href="https://www.lucid-dreaming-kit.com">Lucid Dreaming Kit</a></i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>The ability to maintain awareness of a dream while dreaming seems to be considered difficult if not impossible by many people. How often do we take conscious action within a dream and steer it to a more favorable outcome? Not very often. The Lucid Dreaming Kit improves our chances of realizing lucidity in dreams, using a fairly simple procedure. On one CD in the kit are instructions on how to proceed for a period of seven days in order to achieve/maintain awareness during the sleep cycle. Using a digital watch with an alarm setting on it, one is instructed to set it to beep at various intervals during designated nights. These interruptions‚ some how provoke us to maintain consciousness during sleep and help us subliminally anticipate a coming dream without waking up and losing contact with it. </p>

<p>I particularly liked the accompanying audio CD which the author recommends to play just prior to sleep. The subliminally encoded, eighty minute soundtrack enabled me to achieve a lucid dream state on the very first night that I used it. Frankly, I was rather surprised because I’ve rarely had fully lucid dreams where I was in complete control from beginning to end. I've always had the assumption that one had to actually struggle for years to achieve the lucid state. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the dream, <em>I found myself within a DNA molecule. When I instantly became aware that I was dreaming, I then took direct action and started repairing damaged telomeres, restoring the DNA to its original twenty-two strands, marveling at the codon poetry that played out before me. I would float from location to location in this marvelously illuminated DNA coil and could choose where to go and what to do. I then realized, within the dream, that the DNA molecule I was in was really of universal dimensions, spanning vast distances of interstellar space. It was more like an infinite helix, I realized, when I further investigated and started traveling through it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I was most reluctant to have the dream end and woke up with a feeling that I had achieved something rather significant. The experience was both refreshing and rather amazing as well. It did something peculiarly benign to my waking state consciousness throughout the following day, as if there was some kind of deeper connection and resonance with environments within and without me. I realized that repairing the universal DNA helped with making these deep connections and I actually physically felt better. </p>

<p>Included with the Lucid Dreaming Kit are a Lucid Dreaming screen saver for your computer, a PDF file which contains the day by day instructions the author recommends to follow in order to increase the chances of having a lucid dream and a dream log. (I recently received information from the <em>Lucid Dreaming Kit</em> creator that there is now a version of the audio CD that is eight hours long). </p>

<p>The ease of use as well as the immediate effect the CDs had on my dream life has given me sufficient indication that Thompson's method does work effectively. I've tried other methods in the past to achieve lucid dreams such as Tibetan Dream Yoga but nothing so far has given me the quick results that the Lucid Dreaming Kit has. Check it out! </p>

<p><em>Gabrielle Roth began her exploration of trance dance in the mid-1960s and has devoted her life to honoring and communicating the language of primal movement through her <strong>5Rhythms™</strong>. Her workshops connect the currents of world music, poetry, and theater with the ancient pulse of shamanism. She is author of Maps to Ecstasy, Sweat Your Prayers, and Connections and has a number of musical recordings available on the <a href="https://ravenrecording.com/">Raven</a> label.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jeanne Schul-Elkins:</strong> For more than thirty-five years, your work has been entitled “ecstatic dance.” You have described the five universal rhythms —flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness—as a way to “sweat your prayers.” Could you help us understand how these movements offer a “gateway” to the soul? </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle Roth:</strong> Each of us is a moving center, a space of divine mystery. And although we spend most of our time on the surface dealing with the daily details of ordinary existence, we hunger to connect to this space within us. We yearn to break through to ecstatic states of consciousness, to be swept away by the beloved, and this longing is organic to who we are. </p>

<p>As a young dancer, I made the transition from the world of steps and structures to the world of transformation and trance by exposure to live drumming. It was the sixties on the wild coast of Big Sur, and sometimes these drum sessions would go on into the wee hours of the night. The beats, the patterns, the rhythms kept calling me deeper and deeper into the trance. These dances took me from the edge of myself to the moving center; as I went on this journey again and again, I recognized that the same movement patterns carried me to this blissful place. </p>

<p>In a parallel universe, I was teaching movement to thousands of people and began to observe that these patterns emerged on all dance floors, in all bodies. And so I named them and began a life long apprenticeship to the “5Rhythms!” Being young and wild and free, it didn’t dawn on me that in order to go into these deep, ecstatic places, I would have to be willing to transform absolutely everything that got in my way. That included every form of inertia known to man; from the physical inertia of tight and stressful muscles, to the emotional baggage of depressed, repressed feelings, the mental baggage of outmoded/ outdated dogmas and attitudes, philosophies. In other words, I’d have to let it all go. I’d have to let everything go. And, anyone who wanted to go on this journey would have to do the same. </p>

<p>Thus, a body of work was born in the sixties that is at least seventy-five thousand years old, and is now maturing into a contemporary Zen shamanic practice that has planted its roots and spread its wings into communities all over the world. The concept of soul has been abstracted by religion. But for me, it is a visceral reality. It is when the body, the heart and the mind are completely hooked up into a unique expression of the unified field. In other words, it’s when our style kicks in, and we truly become who we are with our own voice, our own dance, our own fashion, all the accessories to our fabulous fingerprints. </p>

<p>The “5Rhythms!” catalyze and speed up this process. In fact, they make becoming who you are a totally irresistible process.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Early in your career, you worked with Fritz Perls at Esalen. How did he influence the direction of your work?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Fritz Perls was a genius and a friend. He uprooted therapy from the past and planted it in the present; he turned it upside-down, taking it out of the head and putting it into the body. He loved dancers, and when he found out that I had put myself through school by teaching dance to kids on playgrounds, old folks in senior citizens homes, schizophrenics in mental wards, junkies in halfway houses, he was ecstatic. He invited me to teach movement to all of his gestalt therapy groups at Esalen. Thereby, he created the first lab in which I would begin my archeological dig into human nature.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gestalt Therapy, which Fritz Perls created, has a very specific approach to dreamwork. What is your experience with dreamwork?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Writing my dreams down turns me on. It’s a deep and intimate way to get to know myself. Dreams fascinate me, they’re very theatrical, and I treat them as such in my work. I love to stage them as ritual theater pieces. There is something about making them visual and visceral that allows us to go beyond them and take the next step, to make choices, to move beyond the dream. We can use the dream as a diving board into a sea of possibilities as artists, as healers, as lovers.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You are often quoted as saying, “the body never lies.” Would you talk to us about what that means within the context of your dance?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> It’s not that the body never lies, it’s that the body can’t lie. We’ve all had conversations with someone who is telling us how good they’re feeling, and yet we pick up an entirely different message. Perhaps we feel the weight of their sorrow or the edge of their anger coloring their words, shaping their body. What we’re seeing is not what we’re hearing, or what we’re hearing is not what we’re seeing, or some combination of both. The truth is what we carry in our bodies. The deceit is what we struggle with in our heads. </p>

<p>At the root of my work, we are learning to listen to the body, to truly get to know who we are in the most direct, intimate way. Through movement we become familiar with the messages, stories that we carry in our shoulders, in our hips, between our legs, and under our arms. The body is the gateway to the entire psyche. Through the body we enter into the landscape of our inner world, which includes our feelings, our thoughts, our dreams and our realities.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You emphasize connecting with imagination and intuition in your approach to dance. Does stepping into this realm of non-linear, symbolic thought process help bring about “Trance-Dance?”  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> No. Trance-dance is the gateway to an intuitive, imaginative, inspired way of being. In the “5Rhythms!” practice, we’re stretching the mind as well as the body, and exercising it as a muscle so that we are stepping out of our old, tired patterns, into our own style of moving, Our ego lives in a state of unconsciousness and self-consciousness. </p>

<p>But our soul lives, moves, and breathes in an intuitive, imaginative, inspired zone. When we dance, we shift our attention from the chattering monkey-mind to this soulful dimension. We can do the dance of the dolphin, or the dance of a stone or a spider. Through the dance, we can connect to the spirit in all things.  </p>

<p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What do you mean by “Trance-Dance?” Could you help us understand what it looks like?  </p>

<p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> Trance is a tricky place, a place not many understand. It’s a mindful state that only happens when you get out of your way and fall into your true self so deeply that something inside clicks and you are simultaneously being and witnessing yourself. It’s not true that trance is a spell that someone else puts you under. Trance is hypnotic but it’s not hypnosis. Nobody can put you in a trance but God, and God makes you beg for it. It takes a lot of preparation to let go of being the mover and allow yourself to be moved. </p>

<p>It looks holy.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Brenda Ferrimani, 'I am Salmon'. This painting was featured on the cover of Volume 29, #3 of the Dream Network Journal.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Dream:</strong> <em>I am in the spirit realm and I ask Spirit for a name. The name I am given is Salmon because “I try so hard and through my struggles new creation is born.” As I try to tell the people in my dream about my name, I find myself swimming in the ocean. There are thousands of fish around me and I’m moving with the currents. I feel a big fish under me with my foot and in the distance I see a Killer Whale breaching...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember as a young child hearing mom call, “Little Jimmy or (in my case) Little Brenda come home! Dinner’s ready!” Hearing mom’s voice calling was so comforting and I was always so grateful I had a home and a family with whom to share dinner. I would drop what I was doing and run straight for the house! I knew exactly where I was going and how I would be greeted. More importantly I knew my name and when I was called my immediate thought was “Home.” The dream “I AM SALMON” is about my spiritual call home, my special purpose as an artist and my place in our collective human struggle. The giving of a spirit name is a very ancient practice, usually marking a type of rebirth, an initiation to a new path. I have never consciously wanted a new name but my higher self has witnessed my efforts to change through difficult personal struggles and deep soul searching to be authentic. In all my struggles there was an unspoken wish for a new name. </p>

<p>In many myths and cultures the name Salmon is connected to Wisdom and Spirit. Salmon’s body is so rich and nourishing, it is literally life sustaining to many earth creatures. My spirit name Salmon ensures a new spiritual path for me and seems to point to a work that provides a source of nourishment to sustain the spiritual lives of others. </p>

<p>Salmon’s literal journey home is quite miraculous! After spending years in the deep, they’re signaled by a creative urge to spawn. All their energy is devoted to this urge and they're driven to return home. Most of them don’t make it, becoming food to predators, exhausting themselves in rivers. It’s uphill all the way, against the current, jumping over huge obstacles! This so describes my path as an artist! There are millions of us passionately trying to express ourselves! Artists lead the way, pointing to what’s coming into consciousness in the collective. In this way, we have to fight tradition and push our way through obstacles to new thinking. </p>

<p>When my husband saw my painting of the Salmon with the foot he made a connection to evolution and the question of what’s next? I thought the connection brilliant, for many people now hold the belief that humans are on the cusp of a huge evolutionary leap! There was the sense upon awakening from the dream that we are all part of something much bigger than ourselves and that we are being moved by currents toward a destination that is out of our control. At this moment we are in the midst of a great economic recession. How we all struggle! How difficult our situation! However, the implications are much more grave than the loss of a weekly paycheck. There are great planetary issues coming to the fore that have to be resolved if our children’s children can survive. </p>

<p>Now is the time to use Salmon Wisdom. Now is the time to journey home to nature’s harmonious ways. Do we hear our Mother calling? </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Brenda Ferrimani, The Silver Tool, acrylic on canvas</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I had a Silver Tool and I was drawing circles that became worlds. My son watched me as I worked.. He said, "Mom, that's cool! Can I use it?" He took the tool from my hand and left in his car.</em> Dream journal entry, 6/3/98</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth”, an ancient testimony to mankind’s creative history proclaimed long ago. Throughout the ages, we have been inspired by these creative forces to imagine a universe of endless possibility. Our ability not only to have original ideas, but to envision complex realms rich with color, sound, and dimension is unfathomable. In emulating the gods, humans have constantly molded and reshaped their world. Through our mind’s eye, we can visit worlds of the past (Darwin), ponder the very nature of the universe (Einstein), and imagine the future (Gene Roddenberry). We wander through beautiful pastoral scenes (Beethoven) and travel hyper-speed through the galaxy (George Lucas). Some visions reveal dazzling worlds of light (van Gogh), while others visit regions terrifying and dark (Stephen King). What is the source of man’s creative spark? Is creativity limited to only a gifted few? </p>

<p>My dream, <em>“The Silver Tool”</em>, came as an answer to questions about my own creative process and ultimately, the power to create we all share. </p>

<p>We all have the power to create worlds upon worlds, for this is what we do every night in our dreams. Creativity is directly linked to the unconscious mind and paying attention to my own dreams is important to me in unlocking my creative potential. The imagination, held in the unconscious mind, is the silver tool in my dream. As a symbol, silver is reflective (a feminine quality), and related to moonlight (that which lights the night, or the unconscious). Creativity and dreaming are thought to be the domain of the right side of the brain, which is also a feminine symbol... fascinating to me, for I only just realized that in my Silver Tool painting is a woman/ creator on the right side of the canvas! </p>

<p>For me, the powerful and unforgettable visual images of my dream paintings have been tools for understanding myself and transforming my waking world. As I paint these surreal landscapes, I re-experience the dream. It is an intense form of dreamwork where unresolved issues of my own psyche—contained in the colors, symbols, and archetypal language—become manifest in my waking experience. For instance, when I was painting a dream with nests of snakes falling from the sky (snakes representing transformation; Sky, my thoughts), I became conscious of reverse transformation, or my slipping back into old, negative thinking patterns.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grsilv-1.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Nest of Snakes from the painting "Beauty's Challenge"</i></div>

<p>Another example of the way in which painting my dreams is transforming for me is my first painting <em>“Expansion”</em>, which marked a period of growth for me, spiritually, intellectually and professionally. At that time, I was consumed with a desire to know more and could often be found at the library or at home behind piles of books considering—deeply—topics on questions of life, spirit and mind. Professionally, it was also a stretch for me to take on some public art projects larger in scope than anything I had done before. On the humorous side, when I was painting a herd of buffalo, I became really buffaloed when it seemed I was hopelessly and creatively blocked in waking life. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grsilv-5.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>"Expansion" Acrylic Painting</i></div>

<p>Creativity is essential to a healthy spirit, so to a person without sufficient outlets for expression, life can feel like a prison and even worse, a sort of walking death. In the years before I worked as an artist, my dreams told me the story of a woman who could fly like a bird but was constantly brought down... either by a storm or by crowds of people who tried to kill her! </p>

<p>Realizing how important my creative space is to me, I allow time every day to paint, write, sculpt, and doodle these images. I make sure I have time to meditate and have some quiet time in nature so that the unconscious is allowed to breathe. I keep track of my dreams in a journal, which in itself becomes a work of art. </p>

<p>It is important for me to remember to actively support my creative energy, otherwise those inventive, imaginative ideas I have will never become manifest. But, imagination is only the first step; then, I must do the work. In the <em>Silver Tool</em> dream, it is a young man (active, doing energy) who takes the creative tool (imagination) from the woman (receptive, receiving energy) and leaves in his car (vehicle of expression). </p>

<p>In my waking reality, this dream has been reflected in a very literal way by my son’s adopting my belief that we can make the worlds we imagine, real. He too, has honored his creative life by actively pursuing education and work as a musician. My son and I used to enjoy countless conversations about human creativity. We would talk for hours about the unfailing creative recipe of taking a vision or idea and applying mental energy in the way of focus or intent, then adding energy from the heart, providing desire and motivation. All of this producing, finally, the physical result. Contemplating the power of this recipe encouraged and inspired us to continue pursuing the dreams we each held dear. </p>

<p><em>The Silver Tool</em> seems to mirror these conversations and the universal, or collective level of meaning: all creative ideas are held by Universal Mind and have only to be touched by our unconscious minds to initiate the process of becoming real. Everything in our material world was at some time only a thought; in a very magical way, these thoughts become more and more manifest as they move forth from the spiritual, into the mental, the emotional, and finally the physical realm. The four planes of expression are depicted in my painting by four planets: the spiritual as lofty mountains, the mental by a world of complex freeways and connecting streets, the emotional by stampeding horses and the physical by an ever-changing volcanic sphere. </p>

<p>The creative process is an amazing aspect of the human experience. We all have creative ability; we need only to realize and honor that inherent quality. For me, honoring the creative process—individually and collectively—means paying attention to my dreams, allowing quiet time for ideas to surface from the unconscious, and having the freedom to explore and express these ideas. There is great potential in our imagination, just as William Irwin Thompson states in his book <em>Imaginary Landscape</em>, “As webs come out of spiders, or breath forms in frozen air, worlds come out of us.” This is our ‘Power to Create.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Jeanne Schul Elkins &amp; Julia Dawn Elkins</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>I grew up in a household that valued intuitive, non-linear thinking. My father, Roy Henry Schul, raised me on a heavy diet of colorful stories that depicted every phase of his life, including tales about the activities of souls who were no longer living. My mother, Thelma Jane McCollum Schul, continuously shared accounts of her psychic abilities. We lived in a two hundred year old farmhouse on a rambling dairy farm in Upstate New York with my five siblings and plenty of animals and plants of every description. </p>

<p>One of Dad's favorite stories was about his grandfather, who had come from the old country with a stash of money that he kept hidden away. He was particularly fond of his fourteen year-old granddaughter, Margaret, who used to read the Bible to him when he came to visit. Soon after his death, Margaret sat at her grandfather's piano practicing, after the rest of the family had gone out to tend to evening chores. As she played, her grandfather appeared to her and attempted to tell her something. She was shocked and frightened by the sight of him. "I never moved so fast in my life", she reported of her reaction. "When I got to my family, I was as white as a ghost, myself." My father, Margaret's younger brother, couldn't believe she fled from her own grandfather, dead or alive. He always insisted, "Grandpa was probably trying to tell her where he hid his money, so she could enjoy it. She was always his favorite!" </p>

<p>My Dad didn't draw sharp lines between life and death. He certainly wasn't threatened by the prospect of contact with those who had left this life, which was often evident in his stories. So, I guess I shouldn't have been shocked by his expectations, following my mother's sudden death; they had enjoyed more than forty years of marriage. As we sat having a cup of tea the night after Mom's death he confided to me, "Your mother never came to see me last night. Maybe she'll come tonight to say good-bye!" I, however, did not share my Dad's desire to be visited by Mom that night. In fact, I found the idea very unnerving! </p>

<p>Nine months later, when Dad was visiting me in the deep South, he complained that Mom had never come back to let him know she was okay. He went on to share how deeply he missed her. Then, he shared this dream with me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I was in heaven and was looking around everywhere for your mother. Then, I saw her. She was so beautiful and so young. She was eighteen years old. She was standing at a distance with her daughter, Mary Jane, who was also eighteen. Another young woman with them spotted me and began to walk in my direction. I immediately recognized her as Twyla, Thelma's niece. Twyla looked like a perfectly healthy eighteen year old, as well. She called me by name and asked, 'Roy, what are you doing here?' I explained, 'I came to see if Thelma was okay.' She insisted, 'You can't be here. It's not your time. You can see that Thelma is doing fine. Now you'll have to leave.' Then, I woke up."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Daddy, don't you see?" I urged. "Mom did come to you in your dream, or rather, you went to her. She let you know she is perfectly okay now." I shouldn't have been surprised that my Dad didn't make the connection. He wanted something more concrete. </p>

<p>I often feel the same way on my spiritual journey. I want to connect with the Divine on a real, human level. Perhaps that's the product of all our years on the farm; we long to be touched by the Divine on a sensory level that we can actually touch, hear, see, smell and taste. </p>

<p>In his dream, my mother was at the peek of physical perfection, no longer suffering from chronic illness at seventy-nine years old. She was reunited with her first-born child, Mary Jane, who had died tragically at the age of three (fifty-five years prior to my mother's death). In the dream, Janie, as my mother affectionately called her, had grown into a beautiful, young woman, something my mother had longed all her life. Mom was in the company of her favorite niece, who had also preceded her in death. So, my father's dream answered his need to know that my mother was healthy and surrounded by the family members she had so desperately missed while on Earth. </p>

<p>The prospect of being eighteen again probably looked very attractive to my father, who was suffering from the many complications of long-term diabetes. At eighteen, he had joined the U.S. Army during World War II and was stationed in Italy. He often showed my younger siblings and I the photographs of him in uniform and would entertain us with funny stories about his antics. We would always comment on how incredibly strong and powerful he looked back then. Perhaps my father's dream also offered him a very pleasant picture of his potential future. </p>

<p>Two years later, when my Dad died, I felt quite sure he was more than ready to be reunited with my mother. Still, I knew I would miss him deeply. When it was my turn to say good-bye, I cradled his large clasped hands in mine and asked to receive his gift of story telling. I wanted that magical essence of my Dad to be carried on into the next generation and beyond. </p>

<p>My father's dream tending and story telling have deeply informed my life, more than any degree or formal educational pursuit. Five years after his death, I took my family to Germany to visit the homeland of my great-grandfather. After a couple of weeks of touring, we celebrated Father's Day with my husband and our three daughters. Then, we returned to the home of very dear friends that evening near Hamburg, which felt very comforting after so many nights in hotel rooms. That night, on Father's Day, I had a dream. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My parents call me on the phone. In the dream, everything was as it used to be. Mom catches me up on all the news. Then, she hands the phone to my father. Dad then gave me a report on the weather and the state of the crops.</em> During this dream, however, <em>I know that I am receiving 'a call from heaven'.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Mom had lost her ability to speak fluently during the last year of her life, due to a massive stroke. I had greatly missed our long phone conversations. In my dream, she was back to her old talkative self, full of tales about the extended family and very interested in my life and children. I felt reassured of her continuing love and support of my life's journey. During my father's last couple of years, he wasn't well enough to continue his weather predictions, nor did he have the energy to care for the animals and plants that drew him into farming. In my dream, he was again filled with joy and his characteristic zest for life. I even heard his musical laughter ringing out, which always amused and delighted me as a child. It was his merriment that I so hungered for in his absence. This dream addressed my need for contact with both of my parents on a very real, sensory level. I distinctly heard each of their voices clearly, as I so often had in the countless phone calls we had exchanged during my adulthood. I awoke with tears streaming down my cheeks from the pure pleasure of hearing their voices once again and sensing that they were well and happy together in their next life. </p>

<p>Like my father before me, I went to breakfast with a story to tell that morning. I told everyone about the present I had received: a phone call from my parents in heaven on Father's Day! My friends and family were mildly interested, but my youngest daughter, then nine, was completely fascinated. Julia and I discussed the synchronicity of my dream occurring in the same way I used to always call my parents on holidays. This time, however, they called me from the afterlife. </p>

<p>Julia has always begged for just one more bedtime story. She has heard all of her Grandpa's stories retold countless times. She was the first person I ever told about my prayerful request of my Dad's storytelling abilities at his death. So, it's no wonder that Julia finds an easy connection to dreams and storytelling. She and I have told each other our dreams before going to sleep and upon waking for most of her life. Dream telling often replaces storytelling in our nightly ritual. </p>

<p>Now, as the next generation of dream tenders and storytellers, twelve-year-old, Julia Dawn Elkins, writes in her journal about dream life this way: </p>

<p>"I believe dreams are connecting with the future and clinging to the past, all at the same time! I face my reality and my hopes all in one fell swoop! In the blink of an eye, my dream may change and unveil some secret about myself which leads to an emotional journey through self and soul." </p>

<p>The evolution of the dream movement lies in the mindset of the next generation. This is imparted in the way we nurture our children. If we—as parents, teachers, therapists, and clergy—value the intuitive, non-linear thinking process that is a natural aspect of childhood, we cultivate the rich soil of their souls in which their hopes and dreams can grow and unfold.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>More than 35 years ago, in 1972, I had a dream in which my children and I are imprisoned in a strange tower surrounded by a fence and near an ocean. Having spent most of my life, including my childhood years, on college campuses, I associated “strange tower” with “ivory towers”— institutions of learning. But only much later, after studying the dream, did I understand why an “ivory tower” would be portrayed as a prison. In the dream...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...we are allowed outside for periods of time, but we always have to come back in. At times we have to hurry in to escape pursuit by fierce animals such as wild boars and wolves. Sometimes we have to climb the fence to get in to safety before being caught. We know we are being plotted against by an enemy, humans who control the wild beasts too. We feel it is just a matter of time before things will go from bad to worse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kaconf-0.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Tony Crisp, in <em>Dream Dictionary</em>, describes an enclosure in dreams as “the defenses we use, such as pride, beliefs, anger, to protect ourselves from deeply feeling the impact of the world, relationship, love, anxiety, or pain. These are often felt as traps or restraints, even though they are parts of our personality.” Wild beasts can represent emotional aspects or animal instincts that are uncontrolled and unpredictable. </p>

<p>In 1972 I was the 36-year-old mother of two young children living on a college campus where my husband was a professor. At that time, my beliefs probably came from at least three different sources: first, from my parents who impressed upon me a preferred pattern of behavior and set of beliefs; second, from teachers and other authority figures on both social and religious matter; third, from the present college community in which we lived with its own set of expectations for one’s behavior and activities. In the dream, <em>we are caught in a double-trap between opposite dangers—wild beasts on the outside and our captors on the inside</em>—and I was more fearful of what was outside than what was inside. I knew of no way out of confinement. Evidently, the beliefs that were instilled in me as I was growing up caused me to be fearful of what I found in the outside world, and at the time of this dream I felt overwhelmed. But I was conscious neither of feelings of confinement nor of the source of such feelings. The dream was trying to bring this matter into my awareness.</p>

<p>In a dream from 1995,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m trying to escape an institution. A woman to whom I appeal for help shows me, by example, a way to escape.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>George Slater suggests in <em>Bringing Dreams to Life</em> that “images of public buildings, such as institutional... buildings... may refer to being trapped in collective thinking, where the individual is submerged by the institution. Inasmuch as they are man-made, they may refer to structures of a person’s own life experience that have been socially imposed.” </p>

<p>This dream revealed that on an unconscious level I was trying to leave a confining situation, to break away from constricting thoughts and beliefs that may have been imposed by the collective, as well as to call into existence my own set of beliefs and to allow my own individuality to blossom. It was definitely a time in my life in which I needed to get away from old assumptions and expectations of what was important and how I should behave. My conscious mind was very focused on the desire to move from the college community in which we had lived for thirty years. </p>

<p>I was already working on house plans for our retirement home in a new community. </p>

<p>This new dream pointed out that a woman, representing my nurturing, inner feminine, was assisting me. After I was diagnosed with breast cancer a year earlier, at least two of the doctors I consulted urged me to nurture myself as a part of my healing process. Although I didn’t understand it at the time, the dream revealed that I had begun the nurturing process. <em>In Guided by Dreams: Breast Cancer, Dreams and Transformation</em>, I recount how dreams guided various decisions I made during my treatment and recovery. In early 2008, after a passage of thirteen more years, my unconscious was still working on the matter of beliefs, as shown in the following dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I are in some building, almost like a castle. We find ourselves in a large area with many doors and many people. We, along with others, are trying to find our way out of this space. However, whenever we try to open a door, it appears to be locked. Occasionally someone seems to find a way out, but we can’t figure out how s/he does it. At some point my husband disappears and I have no idea where he has gone. I begin to feel desperate. I see someone over to one side who I sense may know “the secret” (to finding a way out of this confinement). She seems to be just hanging around as if she has some official role at this “amusement center.” I go over and almost beg for help, expressing my sense of despair and desperation. The woman smiles knowingly, but acknowledges she can’t tell me; I must figure out the solution for myself. She hints at something to do with buttons, maybe saying something simple and obvious. I don’t recall what this is. I go back to the “doors” and finally spot something, perhaps the buttons, that she might have been referring to. I try pushing one and, sure enough, a door opens to the outside. I hurry out, joining a crowd of people heading down a path leading from this high location. I can tell that at some distance down the path it appears to get terribly steep. I think I see people sliding swiftly down at that point. It looks dangerous, but obviously it is the only way to go.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kaconf-1.jpg" width="400px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I associate the castle situated on a high location with an archetypal storybook castle. I also think of the “ivory towers” that suggest to me institutions of learning and connect this dream to the earlier ones discussed above. </p>

<p>In this new dream, <em>my husband and I find ourselves with many others in another confining place and we are trying to open the locked doors that will provide a way out.</em> As in the earlier dream, <em>I ask a woman (my inner feminine) for help. Although she offers a helpful hint, she says we must find the solution—the way out of confinement—for ourselves.</em> So here is one more metaphoric dream showing my desire to escape the confines of thoughts and beliefs that are hindering my development. Evidently, I still need to figure out what these beliefs are. </p>

<p>I find the timing of the dream significant, since it came the night before my husband and I began participation in a study group on Eckhart Tolle’s book <em>A New Earth.</em> Tolle states that the book’s main purpose is to bring about a shift in consciousness to help us escape the collective dysfunction of the human mind, to transform the distortions of egoic human mind.</p>

<p>He writes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The change goes deeper than the content of your mind, deeper than your thoughts. In fact, at the heart of the new consciousness lies the transcendence of thought, the newfound ability of rising above thought, of realizing a dimension with yourself that is infinitely more vast than thought. We will come to realize that the ‘voice in my head’ is not who I am. I am the awareness that is prior to thought, the space in which the thought— or the emotion or sense of perception—happens.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I note, in reflection on this last dream, that I termed the confining space an “amusement center.” We entertain ourselves constantly with our chattering thoughts. In the dream I “push the right button” and make it out to join others who have escaped. I need to figure out what “the right button” represents in waking life. Perhaps the very steep and seemingly dangerous descent we still must go down represents going down into our unconscious. In the dream this is the only way to completely get away from the confinement in the “castle.” Additional dreams can help me do this. </p>

<p>In a second dream the same night,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am trying to find my way home from some meeting or conference. I have many “papers” with me as well as my pocketbook. I seem to be having trouble figuring out just where I am and which direction I should go. At some point where I have stopped, perhaps to rest/ sleep, I become alarmed when I realize my things have disappeared. I become frantic, fearing I won’t be able to find my way home without the papers and my pocketbook that contains my money and my identification. I’ll be stuck where I am. I’m relieved when someone helps me find/spot my pocketbook. At least I’ll have means to continue on my way.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I equate “home” with our place of origin to which we return at the end of our earthly life. I am trying to find my way there after attending meetings and/or conferences (all the places I go to try to receive guidance for my journey through life), but I am not sure “where I am and which direction I should go.” I fear the loss of my credentials and my money will prevent me from being able to continue on my way. I am relieved when someone helps me find what I thought was lost. This would seem to be a positive outcome; but is it? Perhaps I am too attached to my identification with my ego. Perhaps I still need to learn to let go. David Gordon would classify this as a Dream of Attachment, as he discusses in his book Mindful Dreaming. He and Tolle point out we need to let go of these kinds of attachments to allow something new to emerge in our life. Gordon, in an article about his book, states, “Dreams of Attachment and Letting Go prompt us to grieve and release our attachment to the causes of our suffering. In so doing we awaken—much like those who report near-death experiences—to a deeper contentment and fuller peace than we ever imagined.” </p>

<p>Several books I have been reading recently seem to tie all these ideas together. David Richo in The Five Things We Cannot Change... and the Happiness We Find by Embracing Them presents many of the same ideas, perhaps in a slightly different manner. He states,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Paradoxically, an unconditional yes to who I am, how others are, and what the world is, places me in the best position to grow. We can say Yes! to participating in our own evolution and working toward our life purpose in three ways: by cultivating psychological health, spiritual maturity, and mystical oneness or spiritual awakening. These are not three levels that follow one another linearly; they stand as one integral whole. Each is complete only when it includes the other two. To integrate these three dimensions of ourselves is to combine sanity and sanctity.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreamwork is one of the best ways we can say “Yes!” to participating in our own evolution and working toward our life purpose. Dreams can help us understand what is going on within ourselves—emotionally, psychologically, spiritually and physically. </p>

<p>My discussion so far has dealt with the dreams’ importance for me personally. Personal dreams can also have a message for the collective. In the third dream discussed above, my husband and I <em>“find ourselves in a large area with many doors and many people. We, along with others, are trying to find our way out of this space.”</em> This suggests that an awakening may be taking place among many people—many who have been trapped as I have been by confining beliefs and are trying to find their way out. The fact that thousands of people around the world have been studying Eckhart Tolle’s book by means of the Oprah webcast may be one concrete example.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>How did a dream of mine recorded in November 2002 have anything to do with the Election of 2004? Back then, I had no idea that it did. Some understanding of the dream’s significance came 21 months later after having another dream that I decided must be connected. Here’s the first dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I Visit a Mysterious Place Along with Other People</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>I’m visiting some “establishment”— looking around the large building housing the “place.” There’s a large room that seems to have various spaces used for different purposes. One side is fitted out with rows of seats like church pews. A small area opening onto this seems to be used differently—I see couches and tables. Beyond this is a doorway leading into an area evidently not open to the public.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I’m there with unidentified people. We begin to sense that the place is used for some secret purpose. We are not allowed to explore beyond this “open” area. I say I think even this area with rows of seats, which we are led to assume is a church, has another purpose. I don’t know what. There are “officials” standing to the side overseeing the visit and keeping us from exploring beyond this area. If anyone should try to explore farther, we all would be asked to leave.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>When we do leave the building, we’re surprised to discover that the road into the place has been destroyed—we assume to keep others out. We have to figure a way to get out by finding a path our vehicle can travel. As we get to the edge of the property, we find a vehicle about to enter. I feel we need to warn them about what they may find.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams are messages from our inner selves, drawing background material from our lives and the personal as well as the collective unconscious. Dreams always have multiple meanings and layers of significance. They can deal with our physical health, emotional and psychological status, spiritual life, and relationships with other people. They may also be bringing into consciousness a collective issue or circumstance. </p>

<p>At the time of this dream there was nothing going on in my personal life to which this dream seemed to refer. But considering a “building” to be a symbol for one’s self, perhaps this dream was pointing out that there was a part of me not open to the public, a part that I keep private. This certainly is true, I already was aware of this. But dreams come to bring new understandings, not to point out what you already know. I put the dream aside and hoped further illumination would come later. It came with this next dream in early September 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>While Helping Prepare the “Dance” Floor, I Worry about the Proposed “Game of War” I’m with an unidentified person in a public gathering place. We’re helping clean/prepare some type of dance/recreation space. We are required to do this. I’m complaining to my companion about the situation. Evidently the men in charge are proposing some type of “game” in which others will be required to participate. It is a “game of war.” I say I don’t understand how they can want to do this. It will involve serious consequences for so many people. My companion agrees with me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My immediate association to “the men in charge” requiring others to participate in a “game of war” that will “involve serious consequences for so many people” was our government and our involvement in Iraq. Now there’s the connection to the 2004 Election. </p>

<p>I decided to look back through my dream journals for other dreams of authority figures, dreams that might be connected to this dream. That’s when I saw anew the November 2002 dream recounted at the beginning of the article. In it I visited “some establishment” which we sensed “is used for some secret purpose” where “we are not allowed to explore beyond this ‘open’ area” and “officials” were “overseeing the visit and keeping us from exploring beyond this (open) area.” I now consider this a reference to the then current administration’s policies of secrecy and deception in place in 2002. Examples materialized as it became evident that the real reason for waging war in Iraq was hidden and denied. Decisions and deals with war profiteers were shrouded with secrecy behind closed doors, and the photographs of consequences of the war (dead soldiers, body bags, and coffins) were banned from public view. </p>

<p>In the dream, I said I thought the area with seats like church pews had another purpose. In waking life I believe the faith-based advocacy of the administration at that time was being used to push a right-wing moral agenda and perhaps to support the ideological agenda of the groups to whom support was given. Unfortunately, I think, [and now in the Fall of 2013 I <em>know</em>], the right-wing ideologues are still pushing their agenda. </p>

<p>Next we “discover that the road into the place has been destroyed—we assume to keep others out.” Access to/communication with the government had been destroyed. “We have to figure a way to get out by finding a path our vehicle can travel.” We, the people, needed to find a way out of this situation. The second half of the more recent dream suggested a way. It stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sometime later, after completing our chore, we watch as a couple dances around the outside of the special floor area where we are standing. I comment on how well they are dancing. Then I notice that the woman is much older than the man, who appears to be a teenager. She is “leading.” I comment that she is showing him how to dance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The space we prepared for the game of war had become a dance floor where a couple was engaged in a graceful dance, the dance of life. This is very different from a game of war. </p>

<p>I believe the young male represented our historically young patriarchally dominated nation, one involved in repeated aggressive games of war. I was encouraged to see he was being instructed by the older woman who might represent wise, mature feminine attributes, perhaps even the divine feminine. I hope she was “leading” him back to ways of pre-patriarchal cultures in which people lived without the need of fortifications and weapons, sharing with and caring for all beings. </p>

<p>Dreams come in the service of health and wholeness. In this case, not just for an individual but the collective—the whole world. May we as a nation learn the ways of peace.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>As American bombs began raining down on the city of Baghdad, I found myself in shock, feeling as if we are living in a world gone mad. I feel impotent, seemingly unable to have any effect whatsoever on the horror of what is playing out as reality television on the screen in front of me. What is happening seems totally surreal, as if I find myself in some sort of dream. </p>

<p>Our world is in a completely disassociated state, where the opposites are totally polarized and want to kill each other. It is like we are living in apocalyptic times. The inner meaning of the word apocalypse means <em>something hidden being revealed</em>. Could it be that there is something being shown to us through the events that are manifesting in our world today, if we could only see? </p>

<p>Very dark, diabolical forces are manifesting in our universe. Regardless of our point of view, pro-war or antiwar, I don't imagine that anyone would disagree that an extremely dark energy is manifesting. The word <em>diabolos</em> actually means that which separates, that which divides. The antonym and antidote to the diabolic is the symbolic. Whereas the diabolic dis-integrates, symbols and symbolic awareness brings together and unites that which has been divided. Could there be a clue here to what is being shown to us? </p>

<p>In the apocryphal <em>Acts of John</em>, it says, "... the Lord contrived all things symbolically and by a dispensation towards men, for their conversion and salvation." Symbols are the language of dreams and the unconscious. Symbols are very different than signs, whose meaning is literal, known and can be conveyed in words. Symbols are not only emanations and point to something beyond themselves, but actualize and liberate the energy of this deeper state when we understand them. Symbols are psychic energy transformers which reflect, express and effect a change in consciousness itself. To quote Jung, 'There are, and always have been, those who cannot help but see that the world and its experiences are in the nature of a symbol, and that it reflects something that lies hidden in the subject himself'. I find myself wondering how this 'war' would look if we began seeing it symbolically, instead of viewing what is playing out in our world literally. This means to view our situation in the world today AS IF it actually were a dream that a deeper, dreaming part of ourselves is dreaming up into materialization, and then interpret it as such. </p>

<p>We can view what is happening in Iraq as a "dreamed up phenomenon", an externalization of an inner process; a mass shared dream that all six billion of us have mutually dreamed up into incarnation. What is getting played out in our world is then recognized to be a full-bodied reflection, in symbolic form, of a conflict going on deep inside the collective consciousness of humanity. We can then ask ourselves, what is this dreaming process showing us. What does it mean? What does it show us about the forces deep at work in the dreamer's psyche, who is none other than ourselves? How would we interpret the symbols of this waking dream that is actually unfolding in and as our life itself? </p>

<p>When I contemplate the current world situation AS IF it were a dream, something profound becomes revealed to me. A deeper pattern begins to emerge, a deeper process that underlies and is unfolding through, in and as events on our planet. Peter Jennings of ABC News said to a commentator at the Pentagon, "Let's get the bigger picture". What follows is an inquiry into "the bigger picture", the dreaming process that is in-forming and giving shape to events in our world today; the collective dream of our planet.</p>

<h2>The Universe as a Waking Dream</h2>

<p>'Everything unconscious, once it was activated, was projected into matter—that is to say, it approached people from outside', said Jung. When there is an unconscious factor, it always gets projected out. It is literally, as well as symbolically, 'dreamed up' into materialized form into the (waking) dreamfield. Jung realized that projection was not just a defence mechanism, but was the very process through which we become conscious of unconscious parts of ourselves. Provided, of course, that we recognize the projected content is a reflection of that part of ourselves. When recognized, we can then withdraw the projection, embracing and owning the projected content. </p>

<p>In dreamwork, all parts of the dream are seen to be aspects of the dreamer's self. For what is a dream other than our inner process projected out—into and as—the dreamscape? A dream is clearly an out-picturing, a projection of an inner process that is going on deep inside the psyche of the dreamer. The same process is at work in our waking life. To the extent that we are unconscious of our inner process, it will literally get dreamed up into—as and through—our universe, in full-bodied, but symbolic form. I think of Jung saying, 'The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves'. </p>

<p>To see this universe as a waking dream is to realize that it is embedded in an emanation, a reflection, a projection, a shadow, an echo, of a higher-dimensional reality that is speaking symbolically. Seen as a dreaming process, this universe is reflecting back to us that we need to become more fluent in its language, which is symbolic 'dreamspeak'. </p>

<p>This is why in Tibetan Buddhism one of the translations of the word for Enlightenment is the Great Symbol. The universe is a symbol of itself, both veiling and re-vealing its true symbolic nature at every instant. This reminds of the eastern idea of Maya, who is the source of both the deepest illusion and the highest creativity. </p>

<p>This dreamlike nature of our reality has been articulated in quantum physics, and is called the <em>observer effect</em>. The act of observing our universe actually evokes the universe observed. This realization points to the thought that it makes no sense whatsoever to even talk about an objective universe, as well as an independent observer separate from the universe. For the observer and the observed, the subject and the object interpenetrate one another so fully that we can't even talk about them as being in any way separate. What quantum physics is describing is what I call the physics of the dreamlike nature of reality. </p>

<p>In Buddhism, this process is called <em>interdependent co-origination</em>, in which every part of the universe evokes (dreams-up) and is, concurrently, evoked by (dreamed-up by) every other part of the universe. This is a circular, nonlinear, a-causal, beginningless feedback loop that happens in no time, outside of time... quicker than the twinkling of an eye. </p>

<p>To re-cognize this dreamlike nature is to step out of the linear, literal mind-set of materialism into symbolic awareness, in which matter is 'immaterialized'. This, in order to gain insight into the nature of the symbols that are appearing in our waking dream. They are seen to be an expression of the interplay between the dreamscape and the dreamer, since the two are not separate. The dreamer and dreamscape are mutually effecting one another in a synchronistic, cybernetic feedback loop; the dreamer and the dream reciprocally effect and in-form one another, co-arising simultaneously. This is an expression in which both the dream and the dreamer are contained in and are parts of a higher unity. They are not separate. </p>

<h2>Shadow Projection</h2>

<p>When viewed as a dreaming process and seen symbolically, it is clear that there is total polarization going on deep inside the dreamer, when the opposites are totally split, disassociated and trying to destroy one another. A reflection of this intense inner polarization is happening deep inside the collective consciousness of humanity and it is the 'shadow projection' going on in this waking dream of ours. Psychologically speaking, projecting the shadow is a perverse way of dealing with our own darkness by projecting it onto someone else and imagining that the other is the embodiment of the darkness that ultimately belongs to ourselves. Each side of the polarity is overly identified with the light, or God, splitting off and seeing the other as the embodiment of evil... even of Satan himself, e.g., Bush seeing Saddam Hussein, the terrorists seeing the Americans, the Palestinians seeing the Israelis in this way, as well as visa versa. It should be noted that it is this exact same psychological phenomenon that occurred in Hitler's Europe towards the Jews during the second World War. </p>

<p>Psychologically, it is a very dangerous situation, since a person (or a nation) can become fanatically identified with their point of view, unable to self-reflect, and become possessed by the hero, or saviour archetype. This figure is religious in nature, as it derives from the transpersonal, archetypal dimension of the collective unconscious. The person (or nation) inflated with the hero or saviour archetype wants to save the world from evil. By projecting the shadow onto the 'other' and wanting to destroy them, we literally become possessed by the very same darkness we are trying to destroy, thereby perpetuating a never-ending cycle of violence. </p>

<p>This dynamic is a reflection of and analogous to how—when we are split off and disassociated—the trauma that is at the root of this process endlessly re-creates itself. Seen symbolically, we are at war with a mirrored reflection of our own shadow, engaged in a battle</p>

<p>that can never be won. Etymologically, the word mirror actually means <em>'shadow holder'</em>. If this process of shadow projection continues to go unrecognized and continues to get acted out unconsciously, we can undoubtedly expect not only more dreaming processes like this in the future, but we can expect the message to hit us over the head even more forcefully. </p>

<p>I find myself <em>associating</em>, as if working on a dream. To associate is circular, it is to step out of the linear, sequential, literal and casual mode of thinking intrinsic to the conceptual mind and connect with our intuition, with our divine, creative imagination. To associate is to activate symbolic awareness. To associate is to step into the very dreaming mind that dreams our dreams. I associate to Jung, who describes shadow projection as 'the lie'. I immediately associate to <em>Diabolos</em>, the Devil, who is the liar. </p>

<p>The daemonic, by definition, is a powerful archetypal, transpersonal (beyond the personal) energy that—if we are not in conscious relationship to it—can literally possess us and act itself out through us... whether 'it' be an individual, a group, a nation, or a planet. To quote noted psychologist Rollo May, the daemonic '... is any natural function which has the power to take over the whole person... the daemonic can be either creative or destructive... a fundamental, archetypal function of human experience— an existential reality'. May asserts that violence 'is the daemonic gone awry'. When an unconscious daemonic content is ready to be integrated in a dreaming process, be it personal or collective, it always, to quote Jung, '... forces the subject into its own form, it always appears physically'. The daemonic content—at the point where it is available to be assimilated by consciousness —will both literally, as well as symbolically, get 'dreamed up' into materialization. What this means is that encoded in symbolic form in the manifestation of the daemonic, is it's own re-solution, it's own transcendence. The key to how the situation will resolve is none other than consciousness itself. </p>

<h2>Incarnation as Trauma</h2>

<p>Seen as a dreaming process, what is happening in our world today is not only traumatic to the psyche of tender humankind, but is itself an expression of trauma getting acted out and perpetuating itself in a never-ending cycle. In trauma, we split-off and disassociate from a part of ourselves, becoming alien to ourselves. In trauma, we endlessly and compulsively re-create the trauma, in what is called the repetition compulsion. In the repetition compulsion—a dynamic that Freud rightly calls daemonic—the very act of trying to complete the incomplete process and heal the trauma is the very act that endlessly re-creates it. </p>

<p>Trauma is stored in the daemonic or archetypal dimension of the psyche and to be accessed, so as to be unlocked and integrated, trauma needs to be incarnated (or dreamed up) in embodied form. This is the underlying teleology of the repetition compulsion. We should take note that when a daemonic energy is ready to be integrated, it, too, forces the subject into its own form and gets dreamed-up into, as and through life itself. </p>

<p>It is profoundly important to be aware when an archetypal energy such as evil manifests in a dreaming process where it can be seen. This is not the first time this has happened in our world, it is a recurring situation. When things happen more than once in a dreaming process—the recurring dream— this should get our attention and become an object of serious contemplation. </p>

<p>I immediately associate to the Christ event, in which God incarnated through one man 2000 years ago. When read symbolically, as a dreaming process, God's dark and light sides were totally split, completely polarized in the figures of Christ, who was totally light, and Satan, who was the embodiment of the darkest evil. Jung said, 'It looks as if the super-abundance of light on one side had produced all the blacker darkness on the other'. There was a complete disassociation between the two. This is not merely coincidence, as when the Self incarnates, the opposites fly apart into complete polarization. This is a reflection of the deep, inner split in the collective consciousness of humanity and we could say, the mind of God, as well. It is also an expression that some deeper process is emerging or incarnating. </p>

<p>I find myself wondering if maybe there's a deeper meaning to why our Christianity's myth of the incarnation of God 2000 years ago in Christ was in the form of a trauma, of an abuse drama (the crucifixion). Seen symbolically, trauma is mysteriously related to the incarnation of the Self. Is there a difference between God—who is one with everything and all—putting nails through his own body during the crucifixion, and propelling jet planes through skyscrapers on September 11? Or dropping bombs on cities? Isn't God throwing jet planes through pentagons alchemical dismemberment at its most embodied level? </p>

<p>When seen as a dreamed up phenomenon, the Christ event— and in particular the crucifixion —symbolizes the mysterious correspondence between incarnation (of the Self) and trauma. The cross is a perfect symbolic image of holding the tension of the opposites. Instead of identifying with one side of the polarity and repressing, and hence projecting out into the dreamscape (dreaming-up) the other side—which is the splitting that is characteristic of the traumatized soul—Christ on the cross was the perfect symbol of holding both of the opposites simultaneously. Holding the tension of the opposites is symbolized by being nailed, being really stuck... and is a veritable crucifixion for the ego, which feels its utter impotence and helplessness. A genuine passion play. A true <em>agonia</em>. Unresolved trauma is a literal 'holding pattern'. </p>

<p>When the opposites become totally polarized, this is symbolically related to the crucifixion and is an expression of a potential expansion in-and-of consciousness. To be going through this ordeal consciously is to be nourishing the Self and genuinely imitating Christ. Instead of a symptom, a symbol emerges. Jung calls this the reconciling symbol, or the transcendent function. It is a genuine symbol emerging from the creative tension of holding the opposites, which both unites and transcends the opposites; it both reflects and effects an expansion in-and-of consciousness. This is analogous to the resurrected body coming forth after the crucifixion. This is something the ego could not have done by its own devices. It is truly revelatory; we call it grace, as if it comes from God. </p>

<p>An overwhelming traumatic experience renders us incapable of integrating it in a typical way. Trauma forces us to re-create ourselves anew. Trauma propels us to not only create a new personal and collective mythology, but demands that we connect in a deeper way with our mythologizing, dreaming and imaginative powers. The only way to heal from trauma is to assimilate it, which demands that we radically evolve to a higher state. Trauma is therefore initiatory, as it furthers the evolution of the species. </p>

<p>To say trauma is initiatory means that the experience of trauma itself is the very medium through which a deeper level of consciousness is potentially actualized. I associate to the archetype of the wounded healer, who discover the blessings hidden in their wounding if—and only if—they are able to snap out of the victim identity and experience their wounding as a numinous event that came from God. </p>

<h2>The Death of the Old King</h2>

<p>Jung felt that the major archetypal, mythic process happening in our world today was the death and transformation of the old king, the <em>senex</em>. The aging, sick and dying king is the negative patriarchy, the mythic terrible father, who has become rigidified, egocentric and abuses POWER over others. The negative father is <em>Cronos</em>, father time, linear time. This figure is in need of transformation because he has become disassociated from eros, relatedness, the heart, feeling, and from the feminine. Symbolically, the old and ailing king represents a dominant of consciousness that has outlived its usefulness and become antiquated and anachronistic. This is why in alchemy, the <em>prima materia</em>—which is the stuff that needs to be transformed in order to make the gold of consciousness—is oftentimes pictured as an old man. This figure of the old king needs to be symbolically dis-membered and reintegrated in a higher synthesis, so as to give birth to the hero or heroine who is in touch with the creative. </p>

<p>To symbolically kill the terrible father is to stop interpreting our experience personalistically, reductively and literally, as we snap out of the spell of linear time and wake up to the symbolic, synchronistic dimension of existence. To have symbolic awareness is to re-associate, to re-member, which is the opposite of and the antidote to, being dis-membered. To recognize the dreamlike nature of our experience is to transform the figure of the rigid, concretized old king, who is the figure that is not only acting itself out on the stage of our world, but is a reflection of an inner figure who lives inside all of us. To transform this figure is the birth of the mythical and mystical Sophia, who is none other than the personification of wisdom. </p>

<h2>The Incarnation of God Has Already Happened</h2>

<p>Seen as a dreaming process, Christ is a living, breathing symbol of the Self, of our wholeness, of our holiness. We could even say he is a symbol of God that was dreamed up and emanated out of and into the waking dreamscape. Christ was a perfect symbol, bringing together and interpenetrating the heterogeneous natures of God and humankind in one being. </p>

<p>Christ, in the apocryphal (literally, secret book) <em>Acts of John</em>, shows John a 'cross of light' and says 'This is not the cross of wood which you will see when you go down from here, neither am I he that is on the cross'. Christ himself is instructing John how to view his experience symbolically, as an emanation of and portal into a higher-dimensional reality. </p>

<p>Like any symbol, the Christ event expresses and constellates analogous psychic processes in the beholder. This is why Christ says, 'A mirror am I to you that know me... but if you understand me, you shall be in your understanding as I am... behold what you are. I have shown you... behold what is thine through me'. </p>

<p>Seen as a dreamed-up phenomenon, the Christ event is an unmediated expression or embodied manifestation of a deeper process going on inside the psyche of humankind, as well as the mind of God, that both literally—as well as symbolically —got dreamed-up into materialization, into incarnation, in-through-and-as this very universe of ours. The Christ event was the incarnation, in embodied human form, of an atemporal process that exists outside space/time itself. It is a reflection—in symbolic form—of this higher-dimensional process of the birth and incarnation of God in-through-and-as humanity. </p>

<p>Seen symbolically, the Christ event is showing that the birth of the Self — the incarnation of God through humanity — has already happened in the <em>pleroma</em>, the atemporal fullness of the collective consciousness. The event simply needs to be recognized as such to be made real in time. In other words, the process of the incarnation of God through humanity is playing itself out in linear, sequential time in our world; yet in the atemporal, higher-dimensional reality in which our universe is contained, this process of divine incarnation is recognized to have already been accomplished and is merely actualizing itself through events in this world. </p>

<h2>Revelation of the Dark God</h2>

<p>The word <em>apocalypse</em> means something hidden that is being revealed. God is revealing him/herself through events in our world. It is the revelation of what is called the dark or hidden God, the <em>'deus absconditus'</em>, the wrath of God with all it's Luciferian ferocity. To quote Jung, 'God asserts his power through the revelation of his darkness and destructiveness. Man is merely instrumental in carrying out the divine plan'. </p>

<p>Scholar Rudolph Otto calls it the <em>'negative numinosum'</em>, or the <em>'mysterium horrendum'</em>, as compared to the <em>'mysterium tremendum'</em>. It is the dark side of God, the other hand of God, which fills us with awe. Seen as a dreaming process, it is the return of the repressed, as the part of God that has been denied is the part of God that insistently shows up in a form we would least expect. Interestingly, the inner meaning of the word Satan is the shadow of the Lord. </p>

<p>I immediately associate that Jung refers to Satan as 'the godfather of man as a spiritual being', by which he means that Satan can activate in humankind a process of spiritual awakening. The original meaning of Satan in Hebrew was an angel of God who obstructs. Symbolically, Lucifer is the necessary dark side of life, of shadow revealing light by contrast; Lucifer means the bringer of light. By rebelling against God, Jung continues, 'Lucifer was perhaps the one who best understood the divine will struggling to create a world and who carried out that will most faithfully'.</p>

<p>Jung was very impressed by the paradoxical role that evil played in people's lives. He saw that oftentimes the emergence of evil into a person's dreaming process later revealed itself to be an initiation into a higher good, which was unattainable before its manifestation. This is why he says, 'I am indeed convinced that evil is as positive a factor as good'. As he points out, Lucifer was 'necessary and indeed indispensable for the unfolding and completion of the divine drama'. In alchemy, the most evil figure itself was, to quote Jung, 'destined to be the medicina'. The monsters of the unconscious stand in a secret, compensatory relationship to the ego, supplying everything the ego needs. Jung points out 'It does not seem to fit God's purpose to exempt a man from conflict and hence from evil'.</p>

<p>Over and over again we come up against the figure of Satan, of the Devil, <em>diabolos</em>, Lucifer, the shadow... of the daimonic. What is the meaning of this? What the ancients called demons Jung calls autonomous complexes. Autonomous complexes are split-off parts of the psyche due to an overwhelming trauma that the conscious ego can't assimilate. They develop a seemingly independent and autonomous existence. Like vampires, these autonomous complexes violently resist the light of consciousness, they can't stand to be seen, as being seen takes away their autonomy and omnipotence. The demons best hiding place is in unconscious identification with ourselves, where they can't be seen. They are then able to both project the demon 'out there', while acting themselves out through us. </p>

<p>To see this daemonic power is to recognize it's hidden hand in what is getting acted out in our world. This is why we exorcise the daemonic by naming it, which is to see it and objectify it... which is to be separate from it and take a stance towards it. This is the true power of the Word. </p>

<p>To see the shadow of the Lord, to recognize that it is, paradoxically, totally 'other' while simultaneously a reflection of what is inside ourselves, is to de-potentiate the daemon, so to speak. It is to alchemically transmute and liberate the energy that was bound up in the daemonic compulsion to recreate and re-enact our trauma. This energy becomes available for creatively expressing our greatest love and highest genius. </p>

<p>The word genius is related to the word genie, as in 'I dream of,' and both of these words are related to the word daemon, which actually means the guiding spirit or inner voice. To be genuinely 'imitating Christ' in this sense means to be following, listening to and honoring our inner voice with as much integrity as Christ followed his. The inner voice is related to our 'calling, ' which implies a higher fate or destiny. Finding our calling is to find our true vocation, which is what we are here to do. This is why Christ says, 'If you bring forth what is within you, what is within you will redeem you. If you don't bring forth what is within you, what is within you will destroy you'. Jung openly professed to be in the jaws of his daemon, but was able to transmute it into his creative insights that have helped all of humanity. </p>

<p>When the daemonic is not seen and related to consciously, it possesses us from behind and acts itself out unconsciously through us, and we become like puppets on a string. We have gotten 'drafted' into the more powerful field of the archetypal daemonic energy, as we find ourselves playing a role in a deeper, mythic, divine drama. As long as this divine drama that is enacting itself through us gets acted out unconsciously, it will be played out destructively: this energy becomes truly demonic. And yet, if this energy is recognized, it becomes the source of the greatest inspiration and our highest genius. This is why Jung refers to the daemonic as the not yet realized creative. Like a shaman in the underworld (the unconscious), we are able to alchemically transmute the demons into allies. And once again, the key is consciousness. </p>

<p>I associate to how, psychologically, it is right before the demons get vanquished that they make their worst destructive outbursts.</p>

<h2>A Synchronicity</h2>

<p>Is it mere coincidence that at the exact same time we are at war with terrorism, a new deadly virus, the SARS virus, appears in this waking dream of ours to terrorize us? Seen from the dreaming point of view, this virus is our terrorist process just having changed channels, as it is the same process manifesting in a different form. Like a terrorist, the virus is an 'invisible enemy'. It evokes incredible fear, as it is toxic and can cause death. This virus is seemingly further proof that this is not a safe universe, which just perpetuates the spell, reinforcing the trauma of imagining that we are separate and alien from this universe. Could it be that until we recognize and embrace the terrorist within us, we will continue to dream up a seemingly external agent in one form or another to terrorize us? </p>

<h2>The Continuing Incarnation</h2>

<p>Psychologically, apocalyptic phenomena represent the emergence of the Self, or we could even say the incarnation of God. Talking about Christ as a symbol, Jung says 'He represented a light which, though it shone in the darkness, was not comprehended by the darkness'. Seen as a dreaming process, the incarnation was incomplete, and a further incarnation was needed. </p>

<p>When contemplated as a dreaming phenomenon, the fact that the apocalypse archetype is activated deep inside the human psyche and is playing itself out collectively in this world means that the Self—what some call God—is incarnating not just through one man (like it did through Christ 2000 years ago) but is incarnating through all of humanity. If continued to go unrecognized, this archetypal, daemonic energy acts itself out through us in a destructive way, where —from the dreaming point of view— we all become suicide bombers, since we are killing none other than ourselves. </p>

<p>When contemplated as a dream, the deeper dreaming process is revealing something to us about the nature of the solution of our current crisis. The universe is, literally, primal screaming to be recognized as the higher-dimensionally arranged symbol that it is. To see the deeper pattern that our world is contained in, as well as being informed by, is to snap out of the world of linear causality and realize the world is a living, breathing symbol that we are all mutually dreaming-up together, so as to remind us of this very fact. Like Christ says, 'The kingdom is spread all over and people just don't see it'. </p>

<p>What I am pointing out through words is the 'good news' of the Bible. It's a situation that is playing itself out and already exists and simply needs to be recognized. Our seeing the deeper process that is, in fact, getting played out through us is the very act that radically transforms our entire situation. This is what Christ means in the apocryphal saying, 'Man, if indeed thou knowest what thou doest, thou art blessed; but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and a transgressor of the law'. The implication is that consciousness is the determining factor. If we see and bring consciousness to the deeper process that is enacting itself through us, we receive its gifts; if we don't see it, we act it out unconsciously, and accrue karma. Interestingly, the word evil is etymologically related to the word transgress. </p>

<p>To see the deeper process that is emerging is to recognize that humanity itself plays a key and participatory role in the divine drama of incarnation and redemption, via the act of self-reflection. We become the medium or intermediary through which God reconciles, resolves and reunites the opposites intrinsic to the totality of his/her nature... which includes both light and dark. This is to integrate the darkness that belongs to our totality, as we truly flesh out our full-spectrum hologram, which is what genuine incarnation is all about. These archetypal, daemonic energies then get mediated through the heart and humanized and can be expressed creatively, constructively and with compassion. </p>

<p>God incarnates through humanity, Jung said, '... in order to obtain the jewel which man possesses in his self-reflection. 'To self-reflect is actually a bending backwards and is a privilege born of human freedom, in contradistinction to the compulsion of the daemonic. To self-reflect is a genuinely spiritual act; essentially, the act of becoming conscious. This act of self-reflection, of becoming conscious, registers and effects the entire universe as it gets invested in the collective consciousness of all of humanity. This activates a transformation in the archetypal realm, which results in the incarnation of God through humanity, i.e., the light of consciousness is born. This is why Jung said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'God becomes manifest in the human act of reflection'.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the inner meaning of alchemy, where the ego and the Self mutually, reciprocally redeem one another. The Self becomes humanized (incarnate) and the ego becomes deified (blessed). The boundary dissolves between spirit and matter, as spirit becomes materialized and matter spiritualized. This is the magnum opus (great work) of alchemy, as spirit gets liberated from being imprisoned in matter. The key in alchemy is to have a strong enough hermetically-sealed vessel, or container, in which the alchemical operation can occur. In the case of what is playing out in our world today, the (mystic) alchemical vessel is consciousness itself. </p>

<h2>We Must Be Dreaming</h2>

<p>C. G. Jung was fond of making an analogy between the formation of symbols in the unconscious and the formation of crystals in a saturated solution. For example, if we dissolve sugar in a solution of water, eventually the solution will reach a saturation point. If a single grain of sugar is then added to the solution, a crystalline structure will spontaneously appear in the solution. Any one of us seeing the mirror-like nature of our situation and self-reflecting might be the very grain of sugar that tips the scales, initiating a phase-shift in the collective consciousness of humankind. </p>

<p>Our current planetary situation is clearly one of great instability. Chaos theory points out that times such as these are actually supersensitive situations, much more highly responsive to the smallest change or fluctuation in the system than 'usual'. This literally means that a change in any single individual's consciousness can potentially have an amplified effect on the entire system, in a way that was unimaginable and simply not possible before September 11. </p>

<p>Never before in the history of humankind has consciousness itself been of such importance. </p>

<p>Like a dream, once we stop superimposing our concretized mental constructs upon the canvas of reality and start allowing it to manifest as it truly is, it will reveal its dreamlike nature and resume its revelatory function. Our universe is then recognized to be a continually unfolding oracle whose events are its symbolic script, as it reveals itself to itself, through us. All we need are eyes to <em>see</em>. </p>

<p>One individual having the realization of the symbolic, dreamlike nature of our situation makes it easier and more accessible for others to have the same realization, because we are not separate but are all inter-connected. If enough of us wake up to what is being revealed symbolically, we act as so much yeast in the dough, helping the bread to leaven successfully. Some refer to it as the 'hundredth monkey phenomena'. How many people will it take having this realization to actually make a difference? This is a mystery, but this critical mass is hinted at by the symbolic number 144,000 in the <em>Book of Revelations</em>.</p>

<p>As we realize the dream-up-able nature of our universe, we become conscious of our divine, creative imaginatrix, or what I call our 'sacred power of dreaming'. This is the part of us that is co-dreaming this very universe of ours into materialization. We are all using our God-given sacred power of dreaming 24 hours a day anyway, but we are using it unconsciously, in a way that doesn't serve our highest unfoldment. Let us discover that we can put our sacred power of dreaming together in a way where we can cooperate and collaboratively dream a much more grace-filled dream, in real time, into actual incarnation. This is a revolutionary, radical, epochal and evolutionary quantum leap in human consciousness... unimaginable until this point in our history. </p>

<p>Let us have the mind-blowing realization that the universe is dreaming itself awake through us. Being like a dream, this will only be true if we see it that way. Seeing our life as if it's a dream means that you, dear reader, and I have dreamed up these very words to remind you of this fact. If you tell me that I am only imagining or dream-ing that this is so, I will heave a huge sigh of relief, as you have finally understood. </p>

<p><strong><em>Imagine that!</em></strong></p>

<p>Waking up and becoming lucid inside of a dream is a second order change, where one literally snaps out of a hypnotic trance in which you were identified with being a separate, contracted self, or ego, cut off and disconnected from the rest of the dreamscape. You have an expansion of identity; in full-blown lucidity you realize your identity with not only the entire dream, as it is recognized to be just your own energy projected outwards, but also with the dreamer of the dream — what I call the deeper, dreaming Self — which is who you’ve now discovered yourself to be. The question I want to investigate is, how would you dream the dream onward if you became fully lucid? </p>

<p>When I ask some people this question, they respond by saying they would dream of losing twenty pounds, or getting a million dollars, or something of that nature. I respond by saying that these are all dreams of the smaller self, which is the dream that they’ve now wakened out of by becoming lucid. I remind them that in becoming lucid, they’ve discovered their identity with the deeper, dreaming Self. So the question becomes, how do you imagine this deeper, dreaming Self wants to dream the dream? </p>

<p>Please try and imagine the following as we proceed. You’ve awakened in the dream, becoming enlightened, so to speak, but now that you’ve seen through the illusion of the separate self, you’ve realized that there is no such thing as enlightenment until everybody gets it. For when you become lucid in a dream, the boundary between yourself and others dissolves, as you realize the interconnectedness and non-separation between yourself and everybody else (all six billion others) in the dream. </p>

<p>So many of your fellow dream characters are so asleep, not recognizing the dreamlike nature of their reality; it is as if they have fallen under an enchantment. They’ve become absorbed in the dream and have become so identified with their roles that they’ve forgotten who they are. They are truly suffering a case of mistaken identity. They are all just aspects of you. This is the point where you step into your bodhisattva-nature, as you begin to realize that to be of service to others is to literally help yourself, as who are these others but your own true Self? </p>

<p>Once you’ve become lucid you see that this isn’t a dream that you are just passively watching in a detached way, but a dream in which you are actively participating in and cocreating. You realize that you can consciously step into and cooperate with the dream, helping it unfold to its highest, wherever that may be. This isn’t done from the point of view of the separate, egoic self, whose moment by moment expression is effort-full, straining, and striving, continually strategizing and manipulating the dream so as to fill its imagined sense of lack. This realization stems from a totally different center of one’s psyche, an all-embracing place of fullness, an experience totally unimaginable as long as one is identified with any reference point whatsoever. </p>

<p>Over time, or better yet, when you snap out of the illusion of time itself, you realize that the boundary between dreaming and waking dissolves until you recognize that life itself is the dream from which you are awakening. You begin to have the astonishing realization that the universe is actually dreaming itself awake through us and it takes the most awake and visionary among us to recognize this reality and help further the momentum of the process until it builds up a life of its own. We become agents, or representatives, of this awakening process, as we’ve realized our place in the universal dream, offering our lives in service as a conduit for this incarnating deeper, dreaming Self.</p>

<p>Because we are the evolutionary product of an ancestry stretching back millions of years to an origin in the animal kingdom, many traces of our animal heritage can be found in our physiological and psychological functioning. There is a whole menagerie of animals who emerge during our nocturnal dreaming safaris to the dark continent of our sleeping mind. </p>

<p>What significance should be given to these jungle or domesticated denizens who appear in our dreams? Here are some speculations that have been advanced by various dream theorists: In "The Interpretation of Dreams", Freud proposes that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"wild beasts... represent passionate impulses of which the dreamer is afraid, whether they are his own or those of other people" (1961, p. 410).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ernest Jones, a follower of Freud, says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Analytical experience has shown that the occurrence of animals in a dream regularly indicates a sexual theme, usually an incest one" (1959' p. 70).</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hadfield (1954) suggests that crab, spider and vampire images represent the visceral objectifications of the bodily feelings associated with orgasm. The crab portrays the changes in visceral and abdominal muscles which produce a gripping sensation; the relaxed feelings following orgasm are represented by the sprawling legs and soft underbelly of the spider image; the washed-out feeling of fatigue, as though the blood had been sucked dry, is externalized by a vampire figure. </p>

<p>Jelliffe and Brink noted "the astonishing revelation in psycho-neurotic dreams of the use of animal material" (1917, p. 253). Stekel claims "The danger of approaching insanity expresses itself in dreams of... a sudden attack by a wild beast" (1943, p. 421). Gutheil states "Very often the unconscious is represented by sinister animals" (1960, p.l63). He also proposes that being bitten by an animal may be a symbol of "pangs of conscience". Despert, in discussing the dreams of preschool children, comments "animals as motives are almost always sadistic and often totally destructive, regardless of size, etc. They bite and devour the child or chase him" (1949' p. 141). According to Fodor (1951), being swallowed by a voracious ani mal is a portrayal of our intense fear of birth. </p>

<p>For Jung (1916), animal figures: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"in so far as they do not symbolize merely the libido in general, have a tendency to represent father and mother, father by a bull, mother by a cow".</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freud refers to dreams in which </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"a dreaded father is represented by a beast of prey or dog or wild horse" (1961, p. 41).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a paragraph describing how many specific animals such as snakes, fish and cats are used as genital symbols, Freud states "Small animals and vermin represent small children - for instance, undesired brothers and sisters" (1961, p. 357). Just as Shakespeare used animal analogy as a technique for character 'portrayal (Yoder, 1947), animal figures can be employed to represent various aspects of the dreamer's character. Thus Boss writes "In subjective interpretation a dream tortoise would signify the tortoise-like and armored character of the dreamer himself" (1958, p. 49).</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kanimd-1.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>It's obvious that many theoretical views regarding the significance of animal figures in dreams have been advanced. I found these references when I was preparing a book chapter entitled "Animal Figures in Fantasy and Dreams" (1983). That chapter also contains a review of all the research studies where the frequency or type of animal figures in dreams were given. In one study that I carried out, I examined 2,000 dreams of female college students and 2,000 dreams of male college students to discover how often animal figures appeared and which animals were most common. </p>

<p>There were 149 female and 151 male dreams containing at least one animal figure. This represents a frequency of 7.5% for each sex. The ten most common animals for adults were:</p>

<p>If this table is examined, you can see that women were more likely to have mammals in their dreams while men reported more non mammals. Of the total of 194 animal figures in women's dreams, 128 were mammals, 54 were non mammals and 12 were generic animals. Of the total of 203 animal figures in men's dream, 98 were mammals, 92 were non mammals, and 13 were generic animals. </p>

<p>Mammals are biologically and conceptually more similar to humans. Women report more mammals and they also report more human characters than men do in their dreams (Hall and Van de Castle, 1966). In my chapter, I present some evidence to suggest that a higher level of animal phylogenetic (evolutionary) development may be associated with a higher level of social and emotional maturity.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kanimd-2.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I also examined the animal figures in the dreams of 721 children aged 4 - 16 years old. There were 383 girls and 358 boys. My chapter presents frequencies of each animal figure at each year level for girls and boys separately. Animal figures were present in 39.4% of dreams from the four and five year olders and the percentage figure steadily dropped for each subsequent two year age grouping (35.5, 33.6, 29.8, 21.9, 13.7). The latter figure covers a three year grouping from ages 14 - 16. Animal figures appeared in 29.0% of the combined girls' dreams and 29.6% of the combined boys' dreams. </p>

<p>To make a table comparable to that provided for college students, the ten most common animal figures in the combined children's' dreams will be presented (including monsters, where the dream description made it clear that it was an animal or something like a wolfman rather than a human monster):</p>

<p>The girls reported more mammal figures than boys. Of the total of 128 animal figures in girls' dreams, 91 were mammals and 25 were non-mammals. The others were generic and monsters. Of the total of 130 animal figures in boys' dreams, 73 were mammals and 46 were non-mammals.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kanimd-3.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>It can be seen that some types of animal figures are more prevalent in children's dreams. The combination of snakes, bears, monsters, lions, spiders, gorillas, tigers and insects accounted for 34% of the animals in children's dreams, but this same grouping of animals appeared in only 17% of college students' dreams. Children dream more frequently of wild, threatening animals while college students dream more often of pets or domesticated animals. </p>

<p>To obtain a better understanding of the meaning of animal dreams, I performed a contingency analysis, to discover what other elements are present in the dreams where animal figures are represented. I examined 901 dreams (453 from women, 454 from men) of college students in which all the characters were human and compared them to 150 dreams (75 from women, 75 from men) where at least one animal character was present. The presence of animal figures in dreams has a significant effect upon other features of the dream. Dreams with animal figures are more likely to be short, take place in an outdoor setting which is unfamiliar or distorted, have a great deal of activity, often of a violent nature, or be associated with some misfortune. The dreamer experiences apprehension, becomes more sensitized to various parts of his/her body, and exerts some effort to overcome a challenging problem encountered in his/her dream. As the number of animals in the dream increases, all of the features described above become more intensified. </p>

<p>For those dreams where only humans appeared, there are 28 aggressive acts for every 100 characters present, but in dreams where animal figure predominate, there are 56 aggressive acts for every character. If a dreamer is going to have another character initiate some interactional pattern with him/her, there is a 44% chance that friendliness will be received if the other character is a human but only a 4% chance if that character is an animal. In my chapter, I also look at what types of animals are present in 246 dreams from two groups of Australian Aborigines; 118 dreams from natives on South Pacific islands; 190 dreams from North American Indians; and 448 Peruvian dreams. Fish or other forms of aquatic animals were the most frequent type of animal figures for those groups living near water but were almost totally absent in the dreams of inland dwelling groups (Central Australia and Hopi Indians). Snakes were reported fairly often (27 times) by Australian Aborigines and Hopis but never by South Pacific islanders. Kangaroos, wallabies, crocodiles, and stingrays were exclusive to Australian dreams; the only cats were in Truk Island dreams; and the only exotic jungle animals (lion, tiger, elephant) were found in the dreams of Peruvian students. Thus, in preliterate societies, the animals dreamed about are those the dreamer has encountered in daily living, frequently in a hunting or fishing context, while members of a literate society have an almost limitless number of animals available to them for portraying the animal characteristic needed for a particular dream scenario (sly as a fox, strong as an ox, free as a bird, etc.). The particular types of animals we employ in our dreams will clearly be a function of what culturally shared or personally learned associations we have developed regarding particular animal species. </p>

<p>You might find it a useful exercise to examine your dream journal for the types of animal figures that have appeared in your dreams and note what types of feelings, events, and outcomes were associated with these dreams.</p>

<p>The Beatles released their classic album <em>Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Band</em> in 1967. The cover features the song “Lovely Rita Meter Maid” which describes an initial encounter between the singer and a meter maid who is taking his number. Although initially annoyed, he realizes that “it would be better to love her”. In waking reality, Rita has been “taking the number” of the collective dream community and moving about through the streets and byways of our global community to encourage drivers to be mindful of their dreams and evaluate whether they had been parked and inactive for too long a period of time before taking action and getting moving. Anyone lucky enough to have Rita personally “take your number” has definitely come to love her and she has become a legendary, beloved figure among the global dream community for the last quarter century. </p>

<p>I first met Rita in 1983 at a dream retreat workshop held in Batesville, a small community located a few miles outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a> and I were conducting this workshop and, besides Rita, another dream appreciator who also participated was Carol Warner. At the conclusion of the workshop, we wanted to gather all of the participants together to take a group photo, but Rita declined because she was extremely sensitive about her personal appearance as the result of having been the victim of a tragic accident in an aerospace lab where she was working that resulted in her undergoing extensive skin grafts over a period of many years. That NDE led to a complete redirection of her energy and becoming a spokesperson for the power of dreams. During the subsequent years, she has maintained a close relationship with Ed Butler, her lab colleague whose precognitive dreams enabled him to instantaneously appear at her side and save her life after her other lab partner had abandoned her and fled from the dangerous situation. </p>

<p>At the conclusion of our Batesville workshop, I encouraged Rita to attend the forthcoming first ASD conference to be held a few month later in San Francisco. and she went to it. It was clear that dreams were an important personal topic for her and she was hoping to meet other individuals who also shared her excitement about the unlimited possibilities of dreams for unlocking human potential. I hosted the subsequent ASD conference at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville the following year. I drafted her to serve as Secretary for our various board meetings and she quickly became an absolutely indispensable component of our organization. In addition to having served as Secretary at that Virginia conference, she has also served as a Conference Host, Chair of the Board, Vice President, President, and Executive Officer of ASD. In addition to being the “connective tissue” for the body of that organization’s activities, she has also served as the organizer for the world’s longest continuing dream group, the Metro DC Dream Community, that she founded in Vienna, Virginia in 1983. Rita has never charged a fee for attending these meetings that she hosts. There is a line in the <em>Lovely Rita</em> song that asks “... where would I be without you?” That’s a good question to ponder for all of us, as the answer might well be ”nowhere”, if she hadn’t continued her rounds of monitoring whether the dream scene was stagnating and inactive or was showing tangible movement. When the singer entices Rita to have tea with him, she turns out to be the one who winds up paying the bill. I’ll let the reader develop that metaphor in their own way. </p>

<p>Rita’s attendance at all our ASD events and board meetings has been exemplary and no one else comes close to having earned as many gold stars for attendance and participation as she has. Rita has also been an advocate for attempting to bring dreams to other settings besides those of the annual conference and has been extremely active in serving as the coordinator for regional dream events held at many locations throughout the country. She has also twice organized weekend programs presented at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC to bring public awareness of dreams to that prestigious setting. She attended the international ASD meetings that were held in Ottawa, London, Leiden and Copenhagen. She quickly established family bonds with all these attendees in foreign countries, and once she has met someone, Rita displays an uncanny ability to later remember their names, names of their family members and the town that they lived in. She is one of those remarkable people who seem to display a “photographic memory” for faces, names and places. Many have entrusted their personal dramas to Rita and people turn to Rita much as they would to Dear Abby’s well known advice column. </p>

<p>I have very many special memories of when Rita and I traveled together to Moscow to attend the “Dreaming in Russia” conference organized by Robbie Bosnak. It was an extraordinary time in history because when we arrived in August, 1991, the former Soviet government was collapsing. We were stunned that we were greeted by the sight of Soviet tanks in the streets and armed soldiers who were standing at guard throughout the city. The plan was to have 50 Russian and 50 American dream representatives share their respective views about how dreams were researched and utilized in our respective cultures. While there, we had no contact with the outside world for several days during the emergency period that was declared. These unusual circumstances offered a wonderful opportunity to interact at much deeper levels with our Russian dreaming cohorts and discover, among many other surprises, how much spiritual emphasis was given to efforts to understand the source of dream imagery. Rita has always been a firm proponent for considering dreams as a vehicle to discover “the interconnection of everything, including angels and all beings, lower or higher.. All parts of creation in this flowing, unfolding universe and perhaps beyond.” She and Rosemary Guiley came up with the idea for a dream activism group following the 9/11 tragedy. A reminder is sent once a month for the purpose of dreaming “the awakened heart.” As Rita explains it, “... this focused intent isn’t just about having good dreams, for all dreams come in service of wholeness and healing, but rather about having dreams that move us to concrete action within the parts of the world in which we reside, waking us up to our personal soul purposes or callings that can improve our world through our works, large or small.” The request made to the group once a month is to “Please join, wherever you live on this planet, aligning spirit, soul and psyche searching for dreams that will awaken our hearts and move us to actions.” </p>

<p>In addition to playing a central role in several online dream groups, Rita has also been active in the annual Cyber Dreaming Conference which has been taking place in early Fall for the last seven years. Approximately 150 dreamers from around the world participate in this two-week event which provides non-stop possibilities for sharing questions and observations about dreams in response to papers written by well known experts in many topics related to psychic dreaming. Rita has teamed up with me for several years to conduct our annual Dream Telepathy contest at our annual ASD conference. She helps to facilitate all aspects of the contest while it is ongoing at the conference, and also writes up an interesting detailed report about many of the impressive dreams which were submitted and their close correspondence to the pictures which served as the target material. Rita herself possesses impressive psychic skills as a dreamer and her “hits” frequently receive prizes for the skills that she demonstrates during the Cyber dreaming contests and are also acknowledged by members of her dream groups. </p>

<p>I felt especially honored when Rita served as the moderator for an address I gave on the topic of Angel Figures in Dreams at one of our ASD conferences. This experience was particularly meaningful to me personally because, of all of the people that I have encountered during my span of 80 years, Rita is certainly the most angelic being that I have ever been privileged to encounter. She exudes warmth, kindness, love, support, understanding, acceptance, and a long list of other positive attributes. Rita is an exceptionally advanced spiritual person who seems to be nourished by an intense inner light that enables her to manifest all of these qualities so steadily and effortlessly. </p>

<p>Her generosity of Spirit is pervasive and extends to every single member of the global community. I don’t know of anyone who has ever dealt with Rita Reincarnation Experiment Website: www.reincarnationexperiment.org The Soul Genome Book at discount on Amazon.com. in any encounter who did not feel the presence of an extraordinary amount of love and compassion. These maternal qualities also expand out to her extended family, including her nine grandchildren. She embodies the archetypal imagery associated with “The Earth Mother” and seems to represent a very wise clan mother who reaches out to and nourishes every member of her dream clan. </p>

<p>I was recently reading some comments that Rita had prepared for Amazon.com for one of the books she had reviewed, <em>She Who Dreams: A Journey Into Healing Through Dreamwork</em> by Wanda Easter Burch. Rita wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“This is a deeply inspiring story of a woman’s brave battle with breast cancer... these stormy seasons of her soul are tempered with an in indomitable will to be healed at all levels of her being. Experiencing surgery and then chemotherapy with its dreadful side effects never stops her from turning to her dreams for help and healing. She recounts dreams, her ways of sharing and working with them and using the wisdom she reaps from them. Tested to her depths, she emerges as a beacon to others, a Wounded Healer whose example offers the greatest hope of all to those of us who face life challenges. Her illness may have stolen her breast, but it didn’t harm the caring heart beating beneath it, nor her sharp mind, nor her glowing spirit... all of which are put to use as she rewrites her life contract and now walks on a new path as a Dream Guide and Dream Bringer to others.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These words used by Rita to describe Wanda’s challenges and how she triumphed through dreams seem to correspond extremely well with the journey that Rita herself traveled after her traumatic encounters when her own body was engulfed in flames in 1959. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Natural disasters have been much in our thoughts the past several years. They are frequently in our dreams. How do we interpret such dreams? Dreams can have multiple meanings and layers of significance. They can be bringing to consciousness one’s deep inner concerns about activities, relationships, and emotions in our personal lives. At the same time they can be speaking about worldwide cultural, economic, and environmental issues. At times they may be warning of possible future events. </p>

<p>In my dream journals, I have found dreams relating to various natural disasters, beginning with some of my earliest recorded dreams. Some describe great flooding or massive snowstorms; others describe struggles to survive after some major, but undefined disaster has struck. In 1994:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am living in a small village or community with my family. Some kind of natural disaster strikes. The whole community becomes buried under water or a blanket of something—maybe a blizzard of snow. We are very fearful and worry about our families and friends. Somehow some of us survive, while others die. Either the water recedes or the snow melts and we begin looking for survivors. I don’t find my daughter anywhere. I look and look and can’t find her. I drive out into the countryside—into a valley searching for her. The dream ends or shifts before I find her.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1998, I had a dream that began:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am in an institutional setting. We learn a major natural disaster is fast approaching. There is no point in trying to leave. We just need to find the safest place within our building.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do these dreams mean? Were they warnings? Expressions of personal concerns? Both? </p>

<p>These and many other dreams pointed to unconscious feelings of being threatened. By 1998, I was conscious not only of my personal concerns but also of a collective concern about the potential dangers resulting from global warming. </p>

<p>Six years later, in 2004, the dangers had not gone away. Two dreams the same night cried out to be noticed. The first dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Apparently something drastic has happened and my family and I are told that we will have to move. The news bearer is apologetic, saying he understands this will be quite a strenuous undertaking for us. I agree that it will be, but I’m resigned to the inevitable. I begin thinking of the need to take only a fraction of our belongings in the move. Next I’m standing on a hillside looking skyward and see a huge transport plane overhead. I’m concerned by how low it is, as it goes from my right to the left. I can see that the plane lands somewhere below, perhaps beside a highway not at an airport. Then, as my family and I drive down from the hill, we see many people standing out on surrounding hillsides looking up expectantly, wondering what is taking place, seemingly waiting for something. We circle around and stop on a level area part way to the valley, then get out and stand watching and waiting, as are the others. I get the feeling that we are waiting for some ‘authority’ to appear below to make pronouncements to the multitudes that are waiting there.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awakened with a feeling of unease, almost an ominous dread, but I managed to go back to sleep; then five hours later I awoke from this dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I have gone into some hotel in an unidentified place to await the arrival of a group of people. At first I’m thinking this group is part of my family, but when they arrive it’s obvious they are unknowns. A woman and at least two men walk into our room. The woman sits on my bed, then gets right up and hastily walks back out. The men follow her and we follow them. As we come up to them I overhear conversation between the men and I catch the word ‘infinity.’ I become concerned. I call my husband to me and tell him I’m worried and ask if he heard what the men were talking about. Did he hear the word ‘infinity’? Yes, he heard and he immediately says it’s their word for the end of the world. This is exactly what has worried me. I take it to mean that they belong to a group that is involved in secret affairs, perhaps something we have read about. I’m alarmed and don’t want to have anything to do with them. After I hear my husband’s response, I leave and return to our room.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first dream of this night recounted a displacement of people similar to what happened during Hurricane Katrina, even to evacuation by means of large planes. Was it a warning of something that could happen in the future? The dream occurred nineteen months before Katrina. </p>

<p>The second dream did not spell out a particular catastrophic event. However, it did point to a deep unconscious fear, one that was growing in my consciousness, of a possible end result of a crisis we are facing. </p>

<p>When I studied my dream journals, I recalled that these two dreams came during a period when I was experiencing some stressful health issues, but nothing as drastic as the scenarios of these dreams. The dreams might be simply exaggerating the anxiety feelings or expressing feelings of lack of control in my personal life. But maybe I am also alarmed about our collective crisis. </p>

<p>Six weeks later I had this dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Other people and I have been preparing to travel somewhere, evidently on foot. We are told that things are going to become ‘impossible’ and some people are giving up. I’m thinking we should at least try to leave and go to a safer place. I tell a female friend I see we should begin our journey; we should try to go as far north as possible. As we begin walking, it begins to rain. We see two people lying on their backs on the ground. They have just given up, thinking it’s no use to try anything to prevent whatever might occur.</em> I wake up, feeling this was an awful dream. It had a feeling of doom, perhaps of the impending end of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the import of these dreams goes beyond the personal level. They seem to be speaking of one of the most serious problems our world faces, the consequences of the damage we humans are inflicting upon the environment. One of my earliest recorded dreams, back in 1972, told of living under difficult conditions after a major disaster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Life is not as we know it now. There must have been some major disaster. People are scattered and having to live under ‘survival’ conditions. I am in a small building with people I don’t know. I see the need to be organized concerning jobs within the building for survival, for rationing and using the food we have. I try to get the other people’s attention to tell them of this need. But they are noisy and won’t listen. We have trouble with various stragglers coming by and wanting to cause trouble. There is also danger from strange animals.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2003 people were still not listening in my dreams: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’ve gone to some building to get out of stormy weather. I find lots of other people there. Someone may question why I’m there. I say I’ve just taken refuge from the weather. I receive a phone call from someone I don’t know. The person has heard of me and is begging me to warn other people about an impending disaster. I ask what s/he is talking about. The person says it’s what was in the newspaper and it will happen in two days. I then remember seeing the item referred to. After getting off the phone, I turn to people near me and try to tell them what was said. No one wants to pay any attention.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in fact it is urgent that we all pay attention. In 2003, the world had just experienced the widespread effects of the Asian tsunami, caused by an undersea earthquake. Shortly before I had this last-mentioned dream, P.M.H. Atwater, researcher and author who has written extensively on near-death experiences, reincarnation, and related phenomena, wrote in an area monthly newspaper the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The island of La Palma in the Canaries north of Africa is separating—three more feet of recent date. An eruption would cause half of the island to fall into the Atlantic Ocean, creating a tsunami wave that would devastate the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, not to mention areas in Canada, Europe, and other countries.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this the article I’m referring to in the dream? </p>

<p>With the breaking off of glaciers and the melting of snow fields worldwide, we will see a rise in sea level that is predicted to flood seaports and coastal areas worldwide in the coming years. This would have the same effect as the potential tsunami Atwater mentioned. </p>

<p>So far, the economic and political leadership in the United States has not taken the threat seriously enough to take the necessary steps to avert this catastrophe, or even to plan how to deal with the situation if it happens. Individual and national greed and desires for short-term benefits and pleasures derived from the damaging environmental practices blind us from seeing the greater long-term suffering. </p>

<p>Al Gore points out in his book <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> the dangers facing the world due to global warming. He is quoted on the back cover of the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In order to face down the danger that is stalking us and move through it, we first have to recognize that we are facing a crisis. So why is it that our leaders seem not to hear such clarion warnings? Are they resisting the truth because they know that the moment they acknowledge it, they will face a moral imperative to act? Is it simply more convenient to ignore warnings? Perhaps, but inconvenient truths do not go away just because they are not seen. Indeed, when they are not responded to, their significance doesn’t diminish; it grows.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently a growing number of people and world leaders have finally begun to pay attention. We are hearing calls for going “Green.” As I write this, Britain’s prime minister is announcing that a “Green Revolution is in the making.” We need to take all possible measures to halt and reverse global warming and its serious consequences. It is my hope that our next governmental leaders will make this one of their top priorities. </p>

<p>Is it too late to avoid all the disasters that are potentially impending? We are seeing some of them now— typhoons hitting Japan, earthquakes in China and elsewhere, floods in the U.S. Midwest, wildfires in California, and devastating hurricanes such as Katrina. This makes it even more urgent that we accept differences between groups (local and world-wide), put aside conflict and war-making, and work together to provide for the basic needs of all. If we don’t, we will sacrifice a viable world for selfish and petty gains. Let us listen to the wisdom of our dreams and act with heartfelt compassion to protect and preserve our planet earth and all its life forms. </p>

<p>I believe, as does dream analyst <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a>, that all dreams come to help us in some way. He states that no dream—not even the most terrifying ones—ever come to say: “Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah—you have these problems and you can’t do anything about them!” This means that the dreammaker—the divine within us— believes that if we take seriously this all-important problem, there are things we can do to prevent a catastrophe. We must work together to eliminate toxic substances from all areas of our environment and to find new sustainable and environmentally sound resources, while maintaining the ecological balance of nature, even if it means sacrificing personal and corporate gains. </p>

<p>I believe the dreams I’ve shared are saying, <strong><em>“Wake up, everyone, before it’s too late!”</em></strong> There’s a crisis in the making. Let’s work together to save our world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Many dreamworkers have described the positive values of teaching children about their dreams. Patricia Garfield, Ann Sayre Wiseman, Jill Gregory and others have written on how children can learn in their dreams about their emotions, their fears, their wishes, and their artistic potentials<sup>1</sup>. Yet introducing dreamwork to children has still more values than these: dreamwork can teach children <em>how</em> to think in especially creative, sophisticated ways. Today's children face a future of over-increasing complexity, a future filled with both exciting hopes and frightening dangers. They will need tremendous powers of sensitivity, understanding, and creativity if they are to realize those hopes and overcome those dangers. Teaching dreamwork to children can make a big contribution toward providing them with precisely these powers of thought. </p>

<p>Although dreamworkers do a wide variety of different things with dreams, almost all forms of dreamwork teach a few common mental abilities, a few common ways of thinking: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dreamwork encourages us to appreciate <em>ambiguities</em>, multiple meanings, and the many subtle shades between black and white. Dreams rarely if ever have one simple, sharply defined meaning. The more we work (and play) with dreams, the more we learn to adapt creatively to situations filled with ambiguity and paradox.</p></li>
<li><p>Dreamwork makes us open to <em>surprises</em>, to new and novel situations-it helps us "expect the unexpected". In exploring our dreams we are continuously startled by sudden, unanticipated discoveries. Dreamwork teaches us how to keep our balance when surprising experiences spring up at us.</p></li>
<li><p>It teaches us how to seek <em>resolutions</em> to dilemmas through understanding and patience, instead of through brute force or ostrich-like ignorance. Our dreams often bring us to face upsetting, even frightening, problems in our lives. It is tempting to respond to such problems by angrily fighting against them or by blithely pretending they don't exist. But effective dreamwork teaches us to approach difficult situations with openness, sensitivity, and a willingness to work patiently toward a resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>And, dreamwork makes us more aware of how <em>other people</em> have their own dream worlds. As people share and discuss their dreams with each other, they learn about the unique qualities that unite all people, and also about the wonderfully distinctive characteristics that make each individual human being unique. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now as we consider the kind of world today's children are facing, I would argue that these are the <em>exact qualities</em> they will need to resolve its problems and enjoy its possibilities. The world we are passing along to coming generations will be one of great complexity: extremely different cultures, religions; and races will interact more and more; problems will arise from the convergence of multiple, far-flung causes. New approaches will be necessary, approaches that can adapt to difficult, complicated, and quickly-changing circumstances. </p>

<p>An illustration of how desperately we need to have such abilities for creative thought is the current crisis in the Middle East. The situation there is often referred to as the "first post-cold war crisis", suggesting that it is the kind of dilemma we will frequently face in the future. The U.S. is baffled by all the ambiguities of the Middle East-rather than clear-cut lines we find evershifting sand dunes. We are constantly surprised by events there, caught off guard by changes more sudden than we are able to handle effectively. We agonize over how to resolve the many problems of the region; we seem to be trapped between two awful options-either unleashing the violence of warfare, or surrendering meekly to the injustices of the current situation.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>Perhaps of greatest interest to dreamworkers is how the Middle East crisis has brought to the fore the importance of being able to understand the dream worlds of others. In late October Iraq's President Sadam Hussein reportedly dreamed that the Prophet Mohammed appeared before him and said Iraq's missiles "were pointed in the wrong direction." Commentators in the Middle East speculated that Hussein's dream could suggest that the Iraqi leader is prepared to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. But when U.S. President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was asked for his reaction he said "No comment on dreams. I have enough problem dealing with reality."<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>In a way, this statement sums up our difficulties in facing a crisis as complex and mystifying as that of the Middle East - it seems as strange, as baffling, as unfathomable as a dream. But the harsh truth is that in our world's future such complex crises will be the rule rather than the exception. It seems a matter of simple survival for us and for our children, then, to try and learn how to deal with dreams and with "dream-like" realities. </p>

<p>I am not suggesting, of course, that teaching dreamwork to children would by itself solve the Middle East crisis, Likewise, I would not argue that teaching children to add and subtract would by itself lead to advances in computer technology. But we do teach children elementary math because it provides them with the basic mental abilities that will allow them in the future to work effectively with computers. In just the same way, dreamwork can teach children extremely valuable <em>ways of thinking</em> that will enable them to deal with future problems like those we now face in the Middle East. </p>

<p>The world our children will inherit from us will require enormous resources of creativity, sensitivity, and understanding. Teaching them dreamwork is one of the gifts we can give our children as they step into that world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I left Chicago on Sunday evening, August 18, for the "Dreaming in Russia" conference in Moscow. I was very excited, expecting that the first-ever gathering of Western and Soviet dream explorers would be a fascinating experience. I did not, however, expect that we would suddenly be caught up in a shocking political revolution--for we happened to arrive in Moscow on August 19, <em>the day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt">military coup</a> began</em>. As we drove out of the Moscow airport on Monday afternoon, tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) were streaming into the city. What followed was a roller coaster week of terror, confusion, amazement and, ultimately, joyfulness and hope. </p>

<p>When I returned to the U.S. from the conference, my family and friends said we must not have learned anything about dreams, given all the incredible political events. But when I thought about it, I realized that I did learn a lot about dreams-the Soviet coup itself revealed entirely new dimensions of the dream world to me. For the space of that magical week there was a profound merging of reality, myth and dream. It might sound strange but I believe it was a truly sacred time, in the fullest sense of the word. Ordinary reality was suspended and the most powerful fears, desires and hopes of the human soul emerged, struggling among the desperately constructed barricades and the intimidating lines of huge steel tanks. I've never been in any church or sanctuary that was as overflowing with sacred power as were the cold, wet streets of Moscow during that week. </p>

<p>Myths express sacred power through vivid stories and symbols, dreams reveal that power into our social reality. True political revolutions are the rarest expression of sacred power but also the most explosive. They force us, even more directly than myths and dreams do, to admit that human life is ultimately shaped by powers our rational consciousness does not (yet) fathom. </p>

<p>Now to be honest, these lofty reflections only came to me much later. My first reaction, when we arrived at our conference center just outside the city and heard about the coup, was cool! Totally, totally cool! We're right in the middle of the greatest historical event of the 20th century! Part of me was scared, of course, but part of me was exhilarated. I've been to plenty of dream conferences in my time but never to a military coup! I felt a strong desire to go into Moscow so I could see - and feel - what was happening there. So I joined a small group of people who also wanted to sneak into the city (our Russian organizers had forbidden us from leaving the conference center), and we finally managed to reach the center of Moscow on Wednesday morning, the third day of the coup. </p>

<p>Our first goal was Red Square, the heart of the Soviet government and the control center of the coup leaders. As we rode the Moscow subways, we noticed people clustered around handbills posted on the walls. These were notices from the grassroots resistance movement providing information not available on the heavily censored TV and radio reports. When we left the subways and returned to the street level, we found tanks and APCs everywhere. We tried to reach Red Square, but a line of APCs and soldiers blocked off the intersection in front of us, so we started turning back. But one of our Lithuanian friends (there were three psychology students from the University of Vilnius in our little group) somehow convinced a Red Army soldier to escort us through the APC barrier and over to the other side of the intersection. </p>

<p>It's hard to describe how eerie it felt walking across that big, empty intersection, ominously ringed by heavily-armed military vehicles. The only thing that comes to mind is that it was like walking inside a ritual circle created by a black magician-a sacred space in the sense that it was filled with spiritual power-but a space consecrated to violence, destruction and death. I was very glad to reach the other side of the intersection, squeeze between the APCs, walk through the line of troops and reenter the "normal" space of Moscow's streets. </p>

<p>After getting as close to Red Square as we could, we went to the U.S. Embassy. As we approached the embassy, we saw dozens of crushed, burned-out city buses, surrounded by crowds of people. We learned that the resistance had used the buses to block off the military; however, early that morning tanks had come and smashed through the buses, killing at least three people. We could see the crowd circling around a couple of particular spots. I eased my way in toward one and found it to be a spontaneously created shrine, with icons, prayer candles and a growing pile of fresh flowers. This was the spot where one of the people had been killed. Right nearby the street curb was all broken up, crushed by the grinding weight of the tanks. </p>

<p>We asked the Embassy staff to send messages to our families in the U.S., who we knew could only be imagining the worst about our welfare. When we left, we walked down the hill toward the "White House", the Russian Parliament building where Boris Yeltsin and other Russian national leaders were organizing the resistance to the coup. The scene was one of barely-ordered chaos: the White House was surrounded by huge piles of steel pipes and wood planks, strategically placed clusters of overturned trucks and hundreds of thousands of people waving the Russian national flag. As we stood among the ever-growing crowds at the barricades, we realized that the situation was reaching a crisis point and that perhaps this was a good time for us to beat our retreat. </p>

<p>We rode the train back in awed silence, overwhelmed by everything we'd just seen. But when we reached our conference center, we were met by yet another shock: the coup was over! The military leaders had given up, the tanks and APCs were leaving the city and people were literally dancing on the barricades! The Soviet people at the conference were ecstatic, especially those from Lithuania and Armenia. Their cultures had been violently conquered by U.S.S.R. decades ago and suddenly they were on the road to true independence. I felt very lucky to be with them during such an amazing festival of joy, pride and hope. </p>

<p>Once the coup ended, we were eager to get the dream conference going. There were four main kinds of activities: common lectures, small dream discussion groups, all-group discussion sessions and workshops on dreams and creativity (e.g. dance, theater, sandplay). At each activity there were translators to help bridge the language barriers. The common lectures were OK; I thought the best were by Russian and Armenian scholars who tried to interpret the failed coup in terms of unconscious and archetypal dynamics. The dream discussion groups were a lot of fun! When we share dreams with people from totally different cultures, we realize how important it is to explore what their words, images and concepts mean in their world. The allgroup discussion sessions were not well-received. There were frequent conflicts between the two discussion leaders and the group, and progressively fewer people attended the sessions as the conference went on. </p>

<p>The dreams and creativity workshops were all very interesting. I was in John Lipsky's dream theater workshop and we had a great time creating little dramatic productions from our dreams. It was a perfect activity because it did not require verbal language; instead, we used sounds, motions and facial gestures to share our dreams. </p>

<p>The most joyful and memorable experiences, however, had nothing to do with these formal activities. By far the best part of the conference were the informal conversations in the hallways, at mealtimes, between scheduled activities and after hours at the" magic house" bar. During these more personal encounters we really got to know the Soviet people, to learn about their lives, to share our ideas about dreams and to form new friendships. </p>

<p>The success of the conference was in the way it brought together people from cultures that have demonized each other for, most of this century. Speaking for myself, I've had many dreams over the years in which I've fought against evil, violent Soviet soldiers. It was an incredibly positive experience to meet these people and realize that not only are they warm, caring human beings but also that they share my passion for the world of dreams. My sense was that many people, both Westerners and Soviets, also found the conference to be a powerful experience of healing and integration. </p>

<p>The conference's shortcoming, I thought, was its Jungian bias (the conference was primarily organized by Western Jungian analysts). Jung's dream theories are immensely important, of course, but there's a lot more to contemporary dream studies than Jung. At times I felt like the conference was a Jungian proselytizing mission - like we Westerners were bringing the sacred light of Jungian truth to the dark heathen lands of the Soviet Union. As a result, I fear we may not have shared with the Soviets the full range and diversity of Western approaches to dreams; I also fear we may not have learned as much from the Soviets as we might have. </p>

<p>An interesting aspect of the conference was how the waking world events of the failed coup influenced people's dreaming worlds. Many people said they didn't dream at all during the three days of the coup. A Lithuanian man in my dream discussion group said the waking world was so strange and fantastic that he felt he was dreaming while awake! Others did have dreams that related directly to the coup, for example an American woman - also in my dream group - dreamed during those three days of a disembodied female voice hovering over the resistance movement's barricades in Moscow, encouraging them to struggle on. </p>

<p>I am sure that everyone who attended the conference has different thoughts, feelings and dreams about what went on-all this is nothing more than my own very personal reactions to an incredibly powerful experience. If you want to share others' perspectives, you may want to contact others who attended, like Rita Dwyer, Jane White Lewis, Fred Olson and Dierdre Barrett. You may also contact some of the Soviets as well; many of them asked me to share their addresses, as they are eager to make connections with Westerners interested in dreams. (See pg. 32). </p>

<p>If I took any lesson away from the "Dreaming in Russia" conference, it is this: an idea, shared with the right person at the right time, can create amazingly wonderful, positive, life-affirming effects. Thete are many Soviet people (or, to be more accurate, ex-Soviet people) who are hungering for ideas about dreams - for letters, stories, articles, books, anything we in the West can provide. They have survived a cultural dark age and are now joyously entering a new era of hope and vitality. Each of us can join them in that exciting journey simply by sharing our dreams with them.</p>

  <p><em>"In every dream, whether you are conscious of it while you are dreaming or not, there is some kind of natural phenomenon present. Either it's night and there is a night sky, with or without stars; the sun is shining in the day or it's cloudy; there is a feeling of wind present or not. There is always some kind of natural phenomenon and that is because you cannot dream without the natural phenomenon; it is the nature of things, out of which the dream arises."</em> </p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>From ancient times people have looked to dreams for visions of the divine realms above, and/or the demonic underworld below. But in our time, with our society's pressing environmental troubles, we need to ask a different question of our dreams: what do dreams tell us of <em>this</em> world, the natural world <em>between</em> Heaven and Hades? Can dreams help us heal our wounded, suffering Earth? </p>

<p>Yes they can. In my opinion, we need to listen more carefully to dreamers from non-western cultures, who have always believed that dreams <em>do</em> speak directly to important communal and environmental issues. As recent anthropological studies have shown, indigenous peoples from central and South America, Africa, and Oceania firmly believe that dreams bring forth meanings that are extremely valuable for the community's well-being. They believe that dreams comment on the community's affairs, point to longignored social problems, and offer visions of communal reform, renewal and hope. </p>

<p>We need to realize that the narrow focus on personal, individual meanings is a strictly <em>western</em> view of dreams. Dreams have many, many different dimensions of meaning. Which of those dimensions we discover in our dreams is always determined by the questions we ask of them. If we ask questions about our personal conflicts, that's what we will learn about; but, if we ask questions about the crises facing our culture, we will find that our dreams have much to say about that, also.</p>

<p>Even if we grant that dreams do tell us something about social matters, can they really help us with a problem as massive and intractable as our environmental crisis? The threats of global warming, species extinction, and mounting toxic wastes are tied up with terribly complex political and economic issues; dreamwork, it would seem, is a fly-swatter in comparison to such elephant-sized problems. </p>

<p>Here, we need to listen to what environmentalists themselves say we need to overcome these problems. Most environmentalist action involves lobbying politicians to change laws, protesting against corporate polluters, and trying to develop cleaner, safe technologies. Yet many leading environmentalists admit that these efforts are not enough; they say that we need a deeper, more fundamental change in people's <em>values and attitudes</em> regarding Nature. </p>

<p>Bill McKibben, author of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Nature">The End of Nature</a></em>, says "We must invent nothing less than a new and humbler attitude toward the rest of creation. And we must do it quickly." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Kelly">Petra Kelly</a>, founder of the Green party in West Germany, states "Saving life on Earth requires not only a new way of thinking, but also a new way of feeling. We must work with our minds and with our hearts." And Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in the U.S., insists that "the way to change the assumptions that are destroying the earth is to combine personal transformation with a hard-headed, practical campaign of coalition building, demonstrating and organizing."<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>These environmentalists are all saying, in different ways, the same basic thing: we need, more than anything else, a deep transformation in the basic values and attitudes that guide our society's treatment of the Earth. </p>

<p>My claim is that dreamwork can contribute to this task. Dreams may not help us create new environmental laws or technologies. But, dreams <em>can</em> promote exactly the sort of transformation of moral and spiritual values that environmentalists say we desperately need. Throughout history dreams have been a potent source of new visions, energies, and ideals that have helped people overcome seemingly insoluble problems. Today's dreamworkers have a great opportunity: to help bring the wisdom of dreams to bear on our community's environmental problems.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>Little practical research has been done on the specific question of how dreams can promote greater environmental awareness. However, 1 have an example that might help to indicate the potential dreams have in this regard. </p>

<p>Sam LaBudde is a marine biologist with the Earth Island Institute in San Francisco. In 1987 he engaged in a dangerous environmental spy mission: he anonymously took on a job as a mechanic on the <em>Maria Luisa</em>, a Panamanian fishing boat hunting the Pacific for yellowfin tuna. Schools of tuna are frequently accompanied in the ocean by dolphins, and fishermen had long been accused of recklessly slaughtering the dolphins in the process of catching tuna. However, environmentalists had no hard evidence to use against the tuna fishing industry. LaBudde brought a video camera onto the ship, and whenever the crew hauled up its nets, he casually videotaped the ghastly proceedings: scores of dolphins tangled in the mesh, beaks cut, fins broken, drowned in their struggles. Even though he knew the crew would beat or kill him if they discovered his true purpose on the ship, LaBudde managed to collect extensive video footage. When he brought his films back to the U.S., they caused a sensation-they were shown on national newscasts and at congressional hearings, and they helped ignite a public outcry over the tuna fishing industry's environmental practices. </p>

<p>Months after his voyage on the Maria Luisa, LaBudde suffered a recurrent dream: there were "injured dolphins speaking in cryptic tongues"; the dolphins were "bandaged, crutch-ridden, swathed in all the symbols one would expect from a participant or victim of a war." LaBudde says he feels the dreams reflected "stuff I had to bury on the ship because my desire to speak out or do something about the dolphin kills had to be suppressed."</p>

<p>More recently, LaBudde has dreamed of "annihilating representatives of bureaucratic corporate America"; these dreams, he believes, "are a way of purging that which I fail to deal with during my waking states ... [They're] an outlet that helps me resist the urge to become a felon (for the Earth, of course)." </p>

<p>LaBudde's dreams and his understandings of them provide us with some valuable insights into the question of how dreams can contribute to environmental awareness and action. First, his dreams are about environmental problems; the dreams probably have personal, intrapsychic meanings too, but they are certainly speaking directly to our society's environmental crisis. Second, LaBudde's dreams present powerful, moving images of that crisis. The wounded dolphins hobbling on crutches, struggling to communicate is a tragic, strikingly poignant image that haunts LaBudde long after his voyages; the. annihilation of corporate bureaucrats, by contrast, is a wish-fulfilling fantasy that seems to refresh him and clean out his aggressions. </p>

<p>These dreams prompt LaBudde to further environmental action. The dolphin dreams remind him of the dolphins' torment, spurring him to continue fighting on their behalf; the corporate bureaucrat dreams seem to show him that although it might be satisfying to blast these people out of existence, there may be less violent, more <em>effective</em> ways for him to protect the environment.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>People's dreams often bring forth striking natural images-raging storms, fantastic creatures and plants, cataclysmic earthquakes, mysterious caves, fiery volcanoes. Most western interpreters view such images as personal metaphors (e.g. dreaming of an earthquake might mean the dreamer's world is being "shaken up"). But we also need to appreciate how, in another dimension of meaning, these dream images speak to us about our relationship with Nature; they tell us (among other things) that Nature is powerful beyond our reckoning, full of beauty and wonder, and deserving of our respect. </p>

<p>Bill McKibben speaks of the need for a "new and humbler attitude toward the rest of creation" if we are to stop humankind's destruction of the natural world. It can be difficult to cultivate such an attitude in our waking lives where we so easily control and manipulate the environment. Our dreams, though, remind us of our true relationship to the Earth; we are but one species of creatures in the mysterious unfolding of life, an unfolding that can be incredibly joyous, humbling, and beautiful. </p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>What good is dreamwork for people who aren't already committed to environmentalist values? Can dreamwork promote a transformation of values and attitudes <em>throughout</em> our society regarding our treatment of the Earth? </p>

<p>I would respond by pointing to the most crucial, fundamental insight of the environmentalist movement, which is that all life is <em>interconnected</em> - as John Muir said, "when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe".<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Western society has long asserted that humans are <em>separate</em> from the Earth, and that we can use, exploit, and destroy the natural environment however we wish. Environmentalists have worked hard to overturn that view and to make people realize that we are integrally <em>related</em> to all of Nature. But their efforts have met strong resistance from stubborn, tenaciously held attitudes; environmentalists have found it very difficult to create the deep change in values and attitudes that are necessary for a more respectful relationship with the Earth. </p>

<p>Dreamwork can help promote that deep change. Dreams reveal to us how we are fundamentally <em>relational</em> beings. Anyone who explores their dreams learns to appreciate the complex web of relationships that create and sustain our lives. We learn through our dream experiences to appreciate the fundamentally relational nature of life - the countless ways in which our lives depend on healthy, balanced interactions with other people, other psychic forces within ourselves, and with the natural environment. Most importantly, dreamwork promotes this appreciation in a way that goes <em>beyond</em> mere intellectual agreement. Dreams often bring forth truths with great emotional power; thus we may think we understand the important relational quality of our lives, but our dreams can bring that truth home with a strong, primal, transformative force. </p>

<p>What, then, can dreamworkers do <em>practically</em> to cultivate this potential of dreams to change our values and attitudes toward Nature, to help heal our society's relationship with the Earth? </p>

<p>We can focus on images of Nature in dreams and, rather than reducing them to personal metaphors, can treat them as reflections on our treatment of the natural world. We can ask, what does it mean that I often dream of dark, dangerous forests? Does that affect my views of our society's use of natural resources? What about dreams of speeding around in fast cars - does that give any insights into our society's environmentally destructive obsession with automobiles? In dreams where birds, or fish, or rodents are prominent, might those animals be able to tell us something about the needs of Nature? </p>

<p>The crucial point is that we begin trying to ask such questions. Other cultures have always seen their dreams as speaking to their community's relations with Nature; they have regarded dreams as inner manifestations of the same cosmic forces that shape the natural world.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Indeed, it's no coincidence that many Native American tribes have both a profound reverence for Nature and a profound respect for the communal wisdom of their dreams. Now, our culture needs to learn how to listen to this communal wisdom. We must begin to ask how our dreams can guide us in healing our relationship with the Earth.</p>

Not only can dreamwork contribute to environmental awareness and action; environmentalist insights can also contribute to dreamwork. In short, we also need to ask the question: What can healing the Earth tell us about dreams? While I don't have space in this essay to explore this other side of the dialogue, I would note the following ideas it suggests: that we not use dreams as "raw materials" to be exploited for our individual human desires and that we treat dreams with humility, respect, and reverence.</p></li>

<p>Every parent knows that all children have nightmares - sleep researcher Dr. Ernest Hartmann notes in his book <em>The Nightmare</em> that young children suffer nightmares more frequently than any other age group. Few parents know, however, what to do when the nightmares come. They try to soothe their panic-stricken child by saying, "It's OK, dear, it was just a dream", but that always sounds hollow: the dream may have been just imagination, but the feelings, the fears, are real. </p>

<p>Anne Sayre Wiseman's <em>Nightmare Help</em> offers a very helpful guide to transforming those fears into opportunities for learning and growth. Wiseman is a grassroots therapist with extensive experience in working with dreams. This book evolved out of workshops she gave at grammar schools in the Boston area, where she helped children from ages 5 to 13 learn to understand their nightmares. <em>Nightmare Help</em> is refreshingly clear of mystifying, technical jargon, as Wiseman intends the book for children as much as for parents/adults. Its large format, friendly style, and numerous drawings (which young readers are encouraged to color) all contribute to this aim. </p>

<p>In the children's section of the book Wiseman says that "dreams can be helpers - and if you dare to look at them, they will teach you about yourself". She then explains that nightmares are special dreams that tell us we're feeling scared, hurt, alone, or angry: "Nightmares are designed to wake you up. Nightmares make you really sit up and listen." Children may want to run away from the scary monsters in their nightmares, but Wiseman tells children that she can show them how to stop being so afraid of those monsters. </p>

<p>Wiseman first has children use colored pens and paper to draw a picture of their nightmare. Drawing a picture allows the child to express the nightmare in a safe way by creating some distance: the nightmare is brought back to mind, but now it's put out there, on the paper. This process gives the child a positive sense of control; it's precisely the experience of utter helplessness and lack of control that is so terrifying in the nightmare. Once the child has drawn the nightmare he or she feels the security necessary to begin exploring the emotions the dream has brought forth. </p>

<p>At this point, Wiseman suggests questions that parents and teachers can ask to guide the child in trying to understand the nightmare. For example, she would ask "How could you feel safe looking at that monster?; Try drawing some helpers to be with you in the picture; Ask what the monster is doing in your dream; Is there anything the monster wants? Draw it in the picture and see what the monster thinks of it". </p>

<p>The bulk of <em>Nightmare Help</em> consists of examples from Wiseman's workshops, and it is here that we see the real value of her work. As she presents the nightmares, the children's drawings, and their own attempts to come to terms with the dreams we begin to see how involved the children become in the process. Their nightmares are matters of the utmost importance to them, and it ends up taking very little prompting from Wiseman for the children to struggle with the troubling feelings raised by the dreams. With her help the children find that what had been terrifying has become an opportunity to learn about themselves. </p>

<p>The process she describes is not a form of dream analysis; no special expertise is required, and there is no dogged sleuthing after hidden symbols. Wiseman's goal is to encourage children to develop a relationship with their dreams. She wants to empower children, to help them understand their own feelings and to learn to live with them. Learning to deal with the fears of their nightmares is a good way for children to begin dealing with the scarier parts of the adult world, Wiseman says. In this respect she is working to revive an age-old tradition of using dreams in education. </p>

<p>Anthropologists have discovered that many other cultures teach their children about the meaning of dreams as a way of teaching them about the world. When adults show that they take their children's dreams seriously, children learn both to take their own scary feelings seriously and to trust the adults whose help they need so much. Parents today would do well to remember this the next time they are tempted to say "It's OK, dear, it's only a dream..."</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The study of history shows that revolutionary developments in human thought spring from surprisingly quiet beginnings, and that the people making the pioneering discoveries rarely recognize the future significance of their work. History also suggests that the full implications of their discoveries become most powerful and most influential on the rest of society only when these people reach, and then cross, a certain threshold; when they begin to share their ideas together, to try and integrate their different findings, and to join with each other in common ventures. </p>

<p>The Civil Rights Movement is a good example of this. While lone writers and activists had been struggling against racism for decades prior to the 1960's, it took the efforts of a dedicated group of people, working together, drawing on the visions of those earlier figures, and addressing the concrete problems of their day, to succeed in abolishing practically all state-sponsored racism and bringing on a new era of equality. </p>

<p>Although having far more humble aims than those of the Civil Rights Movement, I believe that those of us interested in dreams today stand at a similar kind of historical threshold. We are in a position now to look back at the work of the various pioneers in the dream world, to relate their discoveries to each other, and thus to come to new understandings of their value. Further, we now may find that these new understandings raise entirely new questions about dreams that couldn't even be asked before, questions that may become the starting points for our own original explorations. </p>

<p>And still further, if we share our explorations with each other and relate them to the life and problems of our society, our dream studies may uttimately contribute to the solutions of those problems.</p>

<p>But is all this too much to expect from the scattered few of us who take an interest in what many people still view as the chaotic and senseless imaginings of the sleeping mind? Is it too ambitious to suggest that a "Dream Movement" is being born? On the contrary, I believe this is exactly what is happening. We can be likened to the midwives of this birth, helping what was conceived in the seminal efforts of past figures take shape, nurturing its emergence into the present, and guiding it on its way toward a future maturity. </p>

<p>If we play a little bit with this metaphor of today's dream explorers as midwives to the birth of a Dream Movement, we will see that besides describing what is going on, it also points to certain responsibilities that we need to fulfill. </p>

<p>The first responsibility would be to develop a deeper awareness of the history of dream study, dream interpretation, dream art - in short, we need to answer the question, "How have we gotten here?" before we can make any sound decisions about where we're going. And while historical analysis is often a tedious matter, in our case it actually leads to some extremely exciting realizations. Dreams have fascinated humankind from time immemorial - yet the last 90 years or so have seen the most profound and dramatic discoveries about dreams and dreaming ever. Indeed, we are now living in what may confidently be called "The Golden Century of Dreaming." </p>

<p>Beginning in 1900 with Freud's <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> and continuing with Jung's theories of the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the individuation process, the field of dynamic psychology rescued dreams from the contempt of Enlightenment rationalism. It showed that dreams, far from senseless and arbitrary, are coherent, meaningful expressions of the unconscious. </p>

<p>Aserinsky and Kleitman's sleep lab research in the 1950's initiated a series of astounding experimental discoveries, among them the facts that all people dream every night, whether they remember it or not, and that the process of dreaming is crucial for psychological and physiological health. Stephen LaBerge's remarkable studies of just the past ten years into lucid dreaming has shaken conventional understandings of dreams to their very foundations. And more generally, the abundance of anthropological research in recent decades has taught us more about the dream beliefs and practices of different cultures, western and nonwestern, ancient and modern, than has ever been known before. </p>

<p>This is our historical legacy. It is a rich and exciting one - filled with bursts of creative insight and with inspiring suggestions for future journeys. But, it is still a very inchoate, fragmentary legacy. These discoveries have for the most part remained isolated from one another. For example, sleep lab research has generally ignored the dynamic psychologies and their claims that dreams are meaningful; the dynamic psychologies in turn have tended to see the understandings of dreams in other cultures as evidence for their own theories, rather than as legitimate ideas in their own right. </p>

<p>Our first responsibility, that of deepening our historical awareness, thus discloses to us that while we are the heirs to some tremendously creative discoveries, there is also a lack of open, mutual dialogue amongst those who have made these discoveries. Our second responsibility, then, becomes clear; we need to create such a dialogue, to stimulate interactions between the different realms of discovery, and to build up a multi-faceted understanding of dreams which is broader than that available from any single source. </p>

<p>We all know that no dream has only one meaning, and that we best understand a dream by teasing out as many of its subtle and varied meanings as we can. The same principle applies to our understanding of dreams in general. What could the dynamic psychologies learn if they made a concerted effort to introduce lucid dreaming techniques into their therapeutic practices? How might lucid dreamers understand their personal experiences better if they knew more about the similar experiences of other cultures throughout history? How much more insight could we get into the dream theories of those other cultures if we looked at them with the discoveries of sleep lab research in mind? </p>

<p>All of these questions remain just that, questions; a dialogue has yet to develop fully which would be answering them. But it is the generation of such dialogue which transforms a group of loosely related discoveries into a growing, dynamic movement. Again, we have now reached a position where we can make the potential for dialogue among the various fields of dream study a reality. </p>

<p>As we consider the ways in which the original discoveries were made, we see that we have a third responsibility; to remain faithful to our own experiences. Had any of the pioneers of the dream world paid attention only to the reigning theories of their day rather than to their own experiences and intuitions, they would never have discovered the new truths that they did. Likewise, even while we affirm the importance of learning as much as we can about different dream theories and practices, we must be careful to use this knowledge as inspiration and guidance for our own investigations, rather than allowing it to limit us. </p>

<p>At the same time, however, the nature of our interests imposes a special responsibility on us. We are often accused of "navel-gazing," of using our dreams to escape the complex and often painful reality of our day-to-day world. This criticism is unfair, of course, for dreams are in fact a tremendously valuable source of insight into the ills plaguing the social world. But it is true that the relationship of dreams to society is difficult to perceive, and thus we have the important task of illuminating this relationship to the rest of our community. We must show how dreams reveal the roots of many social conflicts, how they point to features of those conflicts that we've been overlooking, and how they suggest possible solutions to problems that have resisted all attempts at rational treatment. </p>

<p>These, then, are some of the responsibilities I believe we have as the "midwives" of the Dream Movement - to develop a deeper awareness of our historical roots, to stimulate an interdisciplinary dialogue, to remain faithful to our own experience, and to relate our efforts to the broader life of the community in which we live. I hope that my mildly normative language has not been offputting to anyone. It's just that I believe that these are the basic principles we will have to try and follow if the potential of the Dream Movement is to be actualized. </p>

<p>But the effort will be worth it, for this potential is truly breathtaking. We are exploring new realms of human nature and human experience never before imagined; we are learning new ways of communicating across cultural and historical boundaries; and we are finding new resources for responding to the problems plaguing our society. What other truths and wonders we will discover, once we join together in our pursuits, can only be dreamed of.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align: center"><i>Heart &amp; Circle appeared at Oare lands on 6/21/2010 Photo ©Eva-Marie Brekkestø</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Eighteen years ago my article, <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/dnjart/jocrop.htm">Crop Circle Mystery</a>, <a href="../bcphbp7rfno/11.4">appeared in the Dream Network Journal</a>.<sup>1</sup> The messages being conveyed by the Circles have become clearer since then. Several ideas mentioned in that old article have evolved a great deal. It’s time for an update. </p>

<p>I believe the primary, symbolic message conveyed by the Circles is that humanity has been on a timecycle path that corresponds to the seven chakra levels of consciousness evolution. We are near the “three and a half” midpoint and close to a leap to the fourth, heart chakra level. The idea became clear to me in 1993<sup>2</sup> and was confirmed in 2004, when the Chakra System crop circle formation appeared.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kccwah-1.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Crop circle"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Figure 1</i></div>

<p>Figure 1 is a diagram of the formation. The heart shape represents the fourth chakra, which is the heart chakra. The sixth chakra—or third eye chakra—is the “eye” type glyph. The seventh or crown chakra, is at the top, and includes three lines that project toward the three small circles above. This fits with Kether (the Crown) at the top of the Tree of Life, which appeared as a crop formation in ‘97.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>A cross-type glyph adjacent to the chakra glyphs, appeared two days prior. Significantly, it is aligned between the third and fourth chakras. The arrangement of the two crop formations is similar to universal archetypes, such as an illustration one can find in the <em>Egyptian Book of the Dead</em> and the Navaho sand painting called the Pollen Path. </p>

<p>When we read the <em>Book of Revelation</em> in this light, we can draw similar conclusions. The key verse is Revelation 11:11, where the two trees stand up after three and a half days of being dead. Three and a half is the midpoint of seven, signifying the fourth heart chakra. </p>

<p>The cross (moved a bit closer in the diagram) is like an <em>axis mundi</em>, but also like a swastika. My dreams and research indicate that the swastika is a symbol of mankind as Demiurge, the co-creator of the physical world. Indications are that the future Demiurge is symbolized by Communion, as people become part of the Body of Christ... when they reach the heart chakra level. </p>

<p>Prior to my study of ancient symbols, I had a dream of a counterclockwise Swastika. Energy was flowing from the center, out into the arms. A voice said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These are the forces going out from the center to experience negative manifested events, in order to learn. It is generally square, and you circle counterclockwise.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My dream indicated to me that a counterclockwise—west going— swastika symbolizes a negative, yet learning, experience. The clockwise swastika—east going—symbolizes a positive “good luck” experience (the Nazis not withstanding). </p>

<p>A standard swastika is composed of four “builder” glyphs—the L-shaped right-angled squares used by carpenters, masons and other craftsmen. Swastikas are also formed with four horns. The verses of Zechariah 1:18- 21 tell of the four horns that scattered the nations, and of the four “smiths” (or carpenters) who come to cast down the four horns. I envision the cross/swastika glyph crop formation as moving upward in time, switching to clockwise at the heart chakra. </p>

<p>During the time cycle, I believe we have been unconscious co-creators, symbolized by being underground, underwater or in the water. After the change, we will become conscious co-creators, symbolized by reaching land and becoming lion-kings with royal power who recover their kingdoms.<sup>5</sup> The bottom sphere of the Tree of Life is Malkuth, the Kingdom. Some readers may have had dreams that contain these types of symbols. </p>

<p>Examples of symbols that indicate the unconscious are various water animals, such as fish, sharks, jellyfish and the octopus; boats, ships and submarines also apply. In some cases, the unconscious is symbolized by underground rooms or chambers underground. There is sometimes a descent followed by an assent to the surface (of consciousness). Underground creatures, such as rabbits, can also relate. Foods (for thought) that grow underground, such as potatoes and carrots, may apply. </p>

<p>Dreams of the chakras<sup>6</sup> include various symbols, such as flowers, dishes, coins, umbrellas, or other circular or spherical objects. Colors can be clues, especially yellow (third chakra) and green (fourth chakra). Animals related to flowers can also apply, such as bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies... symbols of transformation. </p>

<p>Other dreams relate to various animals, such as dogs, wolves, monkeys and apes. These are symbolically related to the lower three chakras, which are the animal instincts. This can be symbolized by the lower part of the human body as animal. We are to transmute the aggressive attributes from negative to positive. Black or white animals often indicate this. </p>

<p>The “virgin birth,” according to Joseph Campbell, is the birth of the spiritual person out of the animal person, which happens at the heart chakra. This can be symbolized in a dream by the lower part of the body missing. Dreams of trees may also be related. </p>

<p>Various spheres of the Tree of Life correspond to the chakras. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship of the chakras to the Tree of Life.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kccwah-2.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Tree of life"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Figure 2</i></div>

<p>The tree on the left shows the traditional Tree of Life with ten spheres, numbered one through ten. The tenth sphere represents the earth plane. The upper spheres represent dimensions above our plane which influence us. The left pillar (spheres 3, 5, and 8) is symbolically feminine and associated with judgment. The right pillar, (spheres 2, 4 and 7) is symbolically masculine and associated with forgiveness and love. The middle pillar (spheres 1, 6, 9, and 10) represent a balance of the left and right pillars. <em>I believe a primary message from the crop circles is that there will be a balance of our dualities and a return of the feminine</em>. </p>

<p>The tree illustrated on the right in Figure 2 shows the seven chakras, as they relate to the Tree of Life. Two spheres connected by a pathway form the third chakra. Such “dumbbell” shapes are common in crop circles. </p>

<p>Often, there are four rectangular boxes next to the pathway in dumbbell type formations. This is apparently related to the worldwide 11:11 coincidence phenomena.<sup>7</sup> In August 2010, a Mayan 11:11 type crop formation appeared. This is probably related to the end of the Mayan calendar, which occurs on December 21, 2012, at 11:11 AM Universal Time. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kccwah-3.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Crop circle"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Photo © Charles Mallett</i></div>

<p>Sphere six of the Tree of Life corresponds to the fourth heart chakra. During the time cycle, the sixth sphere is symbolized by the Seed of Life. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kccwah-4.jpg" width="150" height="auto" alt="Seed of life"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Figure 3</i></div>

<p>The Seed of Life is also associated with the Omphalos, a dome-shaped stone found at ancient sites, such as Delphi. It is symbolically the center of the world, a type of <em>axis mundi</em>. Dreams indicate that such a dome is a symbol of the reality we each create, our perception of reality as the circle of the horizon with sky canopy. A dream reported to me in 1991 indicated that our dome of the world perception of reality is being healed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I was on a starship in space with other people. An extremely important message was trying to come in but it couldn’t until we first ejected the garbage. I ran frantically and managed to eject it. The message came in over a console with lights flashing. A doctor appeared and led the crew into a bedroom. He began to work on a yard-high mound of jelly-like substance at the foot of the empty bed. Suddenly, I saw a human-sized hand puppet, a male/female pair with only one hand-hole. They fell back into a vat of water. I went over and looked down at them under the water and knew they had to change. They had to change." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As humanity makes its leap to the heart chakra, the Seed of Life will open like the aperture of a camera, or like a flower blossoming. One example is the 2003 crop formation that appeared at Devils Arrows in the UK (Figure 4) </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kccwah-5.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Seed of life"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Figure 4</i></div>

<p>Other crop formations show the geometry after the opening. These types have a twelve-fold flower-like design on the outside, with a six-fold design in the center, such as a Star of David. This is similar to the traditional symbol of the heart chakra. </p>

<p>The pathway of the “dumbbell” representing the third chakra—between spheres seven and eight on the Tree of Life—is associated symbolically with the Tower tarot card, which shows a tall building on fire with people jumping off. I certainly thought of this when I watched the horrible events of September 11, 2001. </p>

<p>My research indicates that the Tree of Life is often part of the dream landscape in various forms. The pathways can be sidewalks, pathways, roadways, highways, or waterways, for example. Symbols of the spheres can be various buildings or areas, such as lakes, forests, mountains, or parking lots. The third chakra dumbbell pathway can be a bridge, overpass, river or stream. Actual trees often appear in such dreams. </p>

<p>In other dreams, one’s house or other buildings can represent the Tree, with hallways as pathways and rooms as spheres. The various floors of multi-storied buildings, including underground rooms, can represent the chakra levels, or rungs of the Tree of Life. The same goes for ladders and stairways. The seven chakras and the Tree of Life are also within the human body. </p>

<p>The media has routinely presented the crop circles as man-made hoaxes. Most serious researchers disagree. They believe most of the formations are not man-made, because there is quite a lot of evidence to that effect.<sup>9</sup> In my view, the crop circles are significant, man-made or not. Artists of all kinds receive inspirations, which I believe come from the dream world. The creators of crop circles are apparently the collective unconscious of mankind. “They” are us! </p>

<p>Let’s hope my next update will come sooner than eighteen years! ∞ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>A number of dreams and symbols seem to be saying that fear is our greatest problem. The turtle, I feel, is one such symbol. The shell of defense can become a tomb of spiritual death. </p>

<p>The clearest dream-coincidence message concerning fear happened on January 8, 1992. I dreamed: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...that a man was handed a letter: I knew it was basically good news. But as he read it, he became more and more worried. He was thinking of everything in the worst-case-scenario way. The process accelerated until he was reeling with worries. I was saying, "No, no. It's actually good news!" Suddenly my dream voice spoke: "You just witnessed bifurcation into new species of fear."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was astonished that the technical term from the science of Chaos was used. I vaguely remembered that it was a splitting of a certain parameter, as I had read a book on the subject about 2 1/2 years before. I looked up the first reference to the word a nd was surprised to find that the example concerned wildlife populations. The voice had said "species". A bifurcation diagram showed the population levels of animals, and how the number splits in a period doubling, or bifurcation. The diagrams look like snow-capped mountains. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kcfear-0.jpg" width="300" height="auto" alt="Bifurcation mountains"/></p>

<p>Climbing mountains is a common dream symbol that I believe refers to the spiritual path to a higher perspective. </p>

<p>I could see that a climb up this bifurcation mountain, in terms of the dream voice message, would be the process of reducing fears. I looked at other diagrams. A line stands at the top of the mountains, as if a flag had been planted. I learned that this line represented "extinction." A person who conquers this mountain has completely eliminated fears and they can't come back. They are extinct! </p>

<p>As if to add reinforcement, a coincidence happened as I recorded these events. Just as I was writing "extinction", I heard a voice on television say the same word. It was a program about an endangered species. </p>

<p>In late 1990, I dreamed that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I was with a large group of people at the top of the foothills below the Himalayas. We all felt close, like one family. Someone said it was time and we all fell in line, three abreast for the ascent, walking a wide path toward the summit.</em></p>

<p>My feeling is that mankind, <em>en masse</em>, will conquer the mountain. It's hard to believe at this point but if you think about it, the fears are fundamental teachings in our societies; all we have to do is change them! </p>

<p>We are getting a big push from the generating world to do so.</p>

<p>Some readers may know of my awakening to the power of dreams when as a young chemist, an experimental rocket fuel exploded in my laboratory, and I was saved from burning to death by a friend and coworker, Ed Butler. He’d dreamt of the mishap several times before it occurred, and in these nightmares, he pulled me from the fiery scene by one foot, the only part of me that wasn’t burning. When he performed this same rescue in waking reality, he cited his dream “rehearsals” as the impetus behind his actions. </p>

<p>That wake-up call led me to many years of studying dreams and learning how to use them practically, both for myself and in service to others. I used to say that I was a convert from outer space to inner space, but have discovered I’m really hooked on both areas of research, for heretical as it might seem to my aerospace colleagues, I believe that both are interconnected, as is all of life. </p>

<p>In the last issue of Dream Network, (Vol. 22, No.1) several articles sketched views of the evolution of the dream movement, mentioning the scarcity of books, materials, and opportunities available back in the 60’s for those who were interested in dreams personally, not professionally. The 70’s brought books for the personal dream appreciator, with <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> opening up group dreamwork for individual dreamers and the grassroots dream movement finding fertile ground. </p>

<p>Because there were no dream groups in my area, some friends joined me to start the Metro D.C. Dream Community (MDCDC) in late 1983. This group has been meeting continuously since then. MDCDC is open to anyone who wishes to share dreams in a safe environment, no fuss, no fees, just loving support and respect for dreamers and dreams. </p>

<p>In 1984, a dedicated group of California authors and dreamworkers masterminded the first international conference of The Association for the Study of Dreams which I read about in an early edition of Dream Network Bulletin. I attended the conference as a founding life member and became active in the association, filling many roles through the years. These two affiliations, MDCDC and ASD, provided me with my richest learning and an extended dream family. </p>

<p>In the nearly two decades since, dream doors have been opening everywhere, such as burgeoning dream groups throughout the world, including some online, graduate and undergraduate schools offering courses in dream studies, and even more specialized schools granting certificates in dream studies. </p>

<p>We’ve learned that dreams come in service of wholeness and healing at all levels of life and that using them for ourselves or clients are rewarding and commendable occupations, but what’s next? How can we share our knowledge and skills in practical and ethical ways for the good of those individuals who are unaware of the gift of their dreams and of their potential impact upon our current cultural paradigms, as well as upon our suffering planet? </p>

<p>My personal projections and hopes for the evolution of a dream cherishing culture are many and as varied as the skills, talents, and passions individual dreamers bring to light and life. Just as dreams have many levels and are not fully understood unless all are explored, it is my greatest wish that dreams will become honored through all phases of life, from womb to tomb, from nursery schools to nursing homes. </p>

<p>I believe it all begins with education. You know the saying, "Our children are our promise of the future", so beginning with them seems wise. If we teach them at home from their earliest years to share their dreams and to appreciate their creativity, whether through relating, writing or drawing their dreams, our youth will carry these skills through life and to future generations as an heirloom gift that can be opened every night. </p>

<p>Continuing from this early homeschooling, it would my ideal that dream courses be enlarged and enhanced in public and private schools, from the elementary level on up to graduate school, as part of development and enrichment programs, not just courses for psychology majors. As children and young adults garner dreaming skills, we’ll hear more about the use of dream guidance in just about any career or endeavor, for dream life parallels waking life, and a day’s work problem or project will evoke a nighttime response. </p>

<p>Another of my hopes would be to see a renaissance of the use of dreams in spiritual practices within our churches, synagogues, temples, and other spiritual centers. Our materialistic culture has lost sight of its soul and reconnecting with the spiritual power of dreams can only lead to new dimensions of Golden Rule love and caring within society, in turn leading to universal change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We must not forget that the human soul however independently created our philosophy represents it as being inseparable in its birth and in its growth from the universe into which it is born.</em> </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Teilhard de Chardin </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Bringing dreams as sources of intuition and creativity into our working worlds would change the current scientific paradigm which sorely undervalues exceptional dreams, such as those evidencing clairvoyance, telepathy, or precognition. If we could learn to fine-tune these abilities of the dreaming mind, normalizing the so-called paranormal, “Dreaming True” as Robert Moss so brilliantly teaches in his book of the same title, what wonders could be accomplished, what disasters avoided, at work, at home, and in the world at large! </p>

<p>Change may begin with the young, but also could have far reaching consequences for our aging baby boomers and those who care for them. Getting to be on the shady side of sixty, I’ve been asked more frequently to lecture to classes of senior citizens, to those in assisted living centers, and to their caregivers, including HOSPICE workers. Their enthusiasm for working with their dreams is infectious for though they come from generations which didn’t as a rule value dreams, they delight in recounting theirs and finding that they are able to heal past hurts and relive happy memories. Learning to confront the inevitability of death prepares them for a peaceful end-of-life passage. Wouldn’t it be a tremendous service to have a DREAM CORPS of volunteers willing to go into schools, senior centers, nursing homes, and hospitals to talk about and listen to dreams? All it takes is for one person to step out and volunteer, and then another, and another... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...God picks up the reed-flute world and blows. </p>
  
  <p>Each note is a need coming through one of us, </p>
  
  <p>a passion, a longing-pain. </p>
  
  <p>Remember the lips where the wind-breath originated, </p>
  
  <p>and let your note be clear. </p>
  
  <p>Don’t try to end it. </p>
  
  <p>Be your note. </p>
  
  <p>I’ll show you how it’s enough. </p>
  
  <p>Go up on the roof at night in this city of the soul. </p>
  
  <p>Let everyone climb on their roofs and sing their notes! </p>
  
  <p>Sing loud! </p>
  
  <p><em>From Each Note by Rumi</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Massood, an artist with a website displaying magnificent mandalas, writes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“This site is dedicated to the inherent wholeness, unity and interdependence of all things. With the realization that we share life together as a whole and any isolation or separation is superficial. Mandalas symbolize this archetype of wholeness and tend to appear as a reoccurring theme throughout our lives. For me, their recognition whether in the form of a flower or a galaxy, in my dreams or in various religious or historical sites, has always brought a reassuring feeling of connectedness; that I am part of a whole and one with it.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for me, these mandalas are visual metaphors of individual dreamworkers in communion with each other, each playing a unique and colorful part in the overall creation of healing and wholeness, encircling each other and our globe in harmony, unity and beauty. (visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014152157/http://www.massoodworks.com/">www.massoodworks.com</a>) </p>

<p>An evolving dream cherishing society will certainly be helped along by the Internet explosion which has joined dreamers in active online groups that cross international boundaries and cultural barriers as they share dreams and life experiences. Dreaming consciousness is dipping into the collective unconscious to form links at night, connecting us all in the soft, sweet web of dreams, unraveling our cares and reweaving us as friends and citizens of the dream world, and changing how we perceive waking reality as well. </p>

<p>In the last issue of Dream Network, ASD’s web guru <a href="../@richardwilkerson">Richard Wilkerson</a> gave us challenging predictions about the future of the dream movement, looking beyond the current state of networking in virtual territory to take a peek at the Next Generation. Inroads have been made into this new territory with highly successful results, such as last fall’s ASD PsiberDreaming Conference, the brainchild of PSI wizard, Ed Kellogg. Many volunteer presenters and participants from all over the world convened in virtual reality for a two-week conference, an easy access low-cost interchange of information with opportunities to participate in experiments and to share experiences. The huge success of this premier conference paves the way for future ones on other dream topics, and will undoubtedly bring more dreamworkers into the community which ASD’s past president <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Robert Van de Castle</a> dubbed the Rainbow Coalition. </p>

<p>A dream cherishing culture will also arise from the groups which are dreaming together for specific purposes to aid our planet and its peoples. For example, following 9/11, dream pioneer Jean Campbell was inspired to create the World Peace Dreams Bridge. In this large diverse group, dreamers have become friends and truly care about each other, fostering projects for peace and creating positive energy through a variety of activities. </p>

<p>Similarly, at the 2002 ASD conference in Boston, Rosemary Ellen Guiley and I led a workshop called, <em>“Dream Activism: Making a Difference in Our World”</em>, based upon our belief that although dreams are personal, for and about ourselves, they are also interpersonal, and provide the power to connect with others in collectively influencing the course of global life. </p>

<p>Though the members of the workshop agreed that there were many ways in which to make the world better, such as fostering peace, ending poverty, ensuring equal rights, etc. , they deliberately formulated a generalized affirmation that would unite them in dreaming for improved world conditions, yet allow them freedom to focus on their own ideas as to how to effect the changes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tonight I dream the awakened heart; tomorrow I awaken the dreaming heart.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream activists join for incubation each month on the night of 10-11th and share their dreams online at www.asd-dream-activism@yahoogroups.com. Scribe Janice Ryalls weaves the dreams into a monthly report and dreamers make further connections. We are convinced that we can make positive change with concrete actions which will raise social consciousness and collective consciousness, promoting shifts in physical reality. Any dreamer who wishes to make a difference in our world is welcome to join us.</p>

<p>Cultural change comes slowly until a critical mass is reached, and if we each do our part, then Teilhard de Chardin’s theory of evolution will be played out with humankind moving towards the “Omega point” of unity. He also believed that love is the most powerful force in the universe. I personally believe that a dream cherishing culture will flourish not just because of advances in technology, but rather through the union of human hearts and dreaming minds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we look into our own hearts and begin to discover </p>
  
  <p>What is confused and what is brilliant, </p>
  
  <p>What is bitter and what is sweet, </p>
  
  <p>It isn’t just ourselves that we’re discovering. </p>
  
  <p>We’re discovering the universe.</p>
  
  <p><em>Pema Chodon</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The School of Metaphysics in Missouri has for the last few decades been researching the role dreaming plays in altering and in reflecting changes in humankind’s consciousness. They state that dreams are an evolutionary gauge for humanity. Let’s rev up the dial, starting tonight!</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><em>I have a dream: that we will again become a society of dreamers. In a dreaming culture, dreams are valued and celebrated. The first business of the day, for most people, is to share dreams and seek to harvest their guidance. The community joins in manifesting the energy and insight of dreams in waking life.</em></p>

<p><em>In a dreaming culture, nobody says, <strong>"It's only a dream"</strong> or <strong>"In your dreams, mister."</strong> It is understood that dreams are both wishes ("I have a dream") and experiences of the soul; that in dreaming, the soul may travel beyond the limits of physical existence and return with gifts from higher realms.</em></p>

<p>Dreaming traditions-like those of Australian Aborigines, Native Americans and early European peoples - recognize that the dreamworld is a real world, possibly more real than much of waking life, in which we often stumble about in the condition of sleepwalkers. In <em>big dreams</em>, we "wake up" to a larger reality.</p>

<p>Dreaming peoples know that one of the central functions of dreaming is to keep us connected to sources of healing, creativity and spiritual insight in an order of reality that is hidden from ordinary perception. </p>

<p>Another of the vital functions of dreaming is to rehearse us for challenges that lie ahead in ordinary life. Dreaming peoples know that we dream the future, maybe all the time. An Iroquois dreamer of my acquaintance says, "Nothing happens until it is dreamed." If you can dream the future, you may also be able to change it for the better by making intelligent use of the information. </p>

<p>If dreams were honored throughout our society, our world would be different. ... and magical. Let me count the ways: </p>

<h2>1. Dream Partners</h2>

<p>Personal relations will be richer, more intimate and creative. There will be less room for pretense and denial. Sharing dreams, we overcome the taboos that prevent us from expressing our real needs and feelings and open ourselves to those of others. </p>

<h2>2. Family life and home entertainment</h2>

<p>"What did you dream?" is the first question asked around the table in a family of dreamers. In our dreaming culture, families everywhere will share dreams and harvest their gifts of story, mutual understanding and healing. Parents will listm to their children's dreams and help them to confront and overcome nightmare terrors. Best of all, they will learn from their children, because kids are wonderful dreamers. This might be bad for TV ratings but it would bring back the precious arts of storytelling, helping us learn to tell our own story (a gift with almost limitless applications) and to recognize the larger story of our lives. </p>

<h2>3. Dream Healing</h2>

<p>In our dreaming culture, dream groups will be a vital part of every clinic, hospital and treatment center and doctors will begin their patient interviews by asking about dreams as well as physical symptoms. Health costs will plummet, because when we listen to our dreams, we receive keys to self-healing. Dreams often alert us to possible health problems long before physical symptoms develop; by heeding those messages, we can sometimes avoid manifesting those symptoms. Dreams give us an impeccable nightly readout on our physical, emotional and spiritual health. Our bodies speak to us through dreams, giving us timely guidance on what we should do (and not do) to keep them well. For example: </p>

<h3>Gloria's Dream Diagnosis</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gloria had suffered for months from painful swelling in the lymph nodes under her arms. She was worried sick about the threat of cancer and insisted that her doctor perform a biopsy after a mammogram was negative. Her doctor then suggested that the swelling could be caused by "cat-scratch fever." Gloria submitted to medication that did nothing to improve her condition. Frustrated, she asked for dream guidance. In the dream that came, <em>she watched someone being fitted with a neck brace, part of a complicated "head apparatus." In the dream, people were laughing at the patient in a way that irritated Gloria; they did not seem to realize that she had fractured her neck.</em> Waking, Gloria could see no connection between her dream and her physical symptoms. But she was goaded to seek a second medical opinion. Her new doctor detected a link between the pain in her arms and a neck problem she had not noticed in waking life. His examination revealed a degenerative disk disease in her neck. When it was treated, the swelling in her arms went away. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>4. The Care of Souls</h2>

<p>As a dreaming culture, we will remember that the causes of dis-ease are spiritual as well as physical. We will use dreams to monitor and rectify energy loss, psychic intrusions and unhealthy relations between the living and the departed. The insights we gain will help to make Asklepian dream healing and shamanic soul work part of mainstream medicine and psychology. </p>

<p>We will work with dreams that alert us to the "energy thieves" in our lives. Linda dreamed that <em>her car kept stalling because someone she knew was draining its battery.</em> She realized that the energy thief was a needy friend and corrected their relationship.</p>

<p>We will use dreams to facilitate soul recovery. In dreams where we encounter a younger version of ourselves, or are drawn back to a scene from childhood, we are brought to recognize a deeper kind of energy loss, that shamans call soul loss. Through trauma or abuse, through addiction or great sadness, we can lose a part of our vital soul energy. So long as it is missing, we are not whole and the gap may be filled by sickness or addiction. Dreams show us what has become of our lost children and when it is timely to call them home. </p>

<h2>5. Dream Incubation</h2>

<p>In a dreaming culture, we will remember to "sleep on it", asking dreams for creative guidance on school assignments, work projects,relationships and whatever challenges are looming in waking life. When we seek dream guidance, we must be ready for answers that go beyond our questions, because the dream source is infinitely deeper and wiser than what Yeats called the "daily trivial mind." </p>

<p>Some of the dreams I have incubated have been watershed events in my life, leading me beyond ego-bound agendas. I once sought dream guidance on a plan to write a commercial thriller, following the formula of a previous bestseller I had published. In my dream, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I entered a luxurious restaurant where a banquet for thousands was about to be served, all in my honor. There was just one problem: the master chef had walked out because he did not like my menu.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got the message: If I chose to repeat myself in pursuit of commercial success, I would part company with the most creative part of myself, my "master chef". I abandoned the book project because of this dream, which brought me the salutary reminder that value must never be confused with market valuation. </p>

<h2>6. Using Dream Radar</h2>

<p>Dreaming, we routinely fold time and space and scout far into the future. In my journals, I have logged hundreds of correspondences between dreams and subsequent events in waking life. </p>

<p>Here are two typical examples: </p>

<h3>Dream #1:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sixty-eight people have enrolled for one of my work-shops. The week-end presents complex challenges, which my dream rehearses in detail. (7/31-8/1/96)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow-up: Just over a year later, sixtyeight people signed up for one of my workshops. The old dream report provided invaluable and specific guidance on challenges that developed in the course of the weekend. (8/28/97) </p>

<h3>Dream #2:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am watching a silly little dog decked out in fake antlers for a Christmas pageant. The dog runs out on the road and is killed but is magically revived by a bizarre character who seemed alien to normal patterns of human behavior. (3/9-10/97)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow-up: The next day, thanks to a missed connection and a change of flights, I found myself watching the in-flight movie on a plane bound for Denver. A silly dog with fake antlers appeared on the screen. The dog was killed on the road and miraculously revived by a low-flying angel played by John Travolta in the movie "Michael." (3/10/97)</p>

<p>I have never seen more time wasted in dreamwork than when we fail to run a simple reality check on dream material to explore the possibility that we have previewed the future. As a dreaming culture, we will work with dream precognition on a daily basis-and develop strategies to revise the possible futures foreseen in dreams for the benefit of ourselves and others. </p>

<h2>7. Building Communities</h2>

<p>When we share dreams with others, we recognize something ofourselves in their experiences. Working with beginners' dream groups, I enjoy the thrill of recognition that travels round the circle as people announce the titles of their dreams . "Naked in public. "Back in school." "Falling." "Snake dance." "My dead mother comes to visit". </p>

<p>Dreaming, we actually find ourselves in the skin and life situations of different people. A Texas woman shared the following dream: </p>

<h3>In A Black Man's Body</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am walking down the street in New Orleans. I notice something different about myself, about my perception of temperature, the way my body hangs. I look down and notice I have very long, muscular legs. A man's legs! And they're black! At this point, I become aware I am dreaming. I am drawn to the smell of wonderful cajun food wafting from a restaurant. A couple of white men block my way, making racist remarks. Someone signals telepathically, "Get out of this place before you succumb to his rage."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Texas woman marveled at the way she found herself inside the mindset of another person. "If we could all have the experience of being in someone else's skin," she told me, "we'd get over our prejudice and preconceptions." I believe she is right. In our dreaming culture, we will build community on the level of soul. </p>

<h2>8. The Art of Dying</h2>

<p>The path of the soul after death, say the Plains Indians, is the same as the path of the soul in dreams - except that after physical death, we won't come back to the same body. Dreamwork is a vital tool in helping the dying to prepare for the conditions of the afterlife. For example:</p>

<h3>Wendy's Waterslide World</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wendy dreamed she was <em>shooting down a slide into an Olympic-size swimming pool, behind her mother. She was happy but puzzled, because in waking life her mother was terrified of the water and had never learned to swim. As Wendy' s mother splashed into the pool, a barrier came down, preventing Wendy from following. When she peered over the barrier, she saw her mother frolicking with a handsome, muscular young man she recognized as her father as he might have looked when he was thirty.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When she shared this dream, Wendy told me she felt her elderly mother was approaching death but was full of fear. Her mother had never shared dreams. "I had the dream my mother should have had." Wendy mused. I suggested she might try recounting the dream to her mother, bring ing out all the happy, sensual detail and see whether in some way she could make it her mother's dream. </p>

<p>Wendy's mother enjoyed this, asking her to retell the dream again and again. A week later, she called in high excitement to report that she had had her own dream of her late husband. He had appeared as a handsome 30-year-old. He told her he lived in a beautiful valley where it was always spring and would be waiting for her when her time came. </p>

<p>In our dreaming culture, dream encounters with the departed will no longer be psychologized away. They will be screened carefully to establish whether they are genuine contacts and whether they contain information that is helpful to either the living or the departed. In the year after my father's death, he came to me repeatedly in dreams with valuable guidance for the family, including practical and specific information to which I did not have access in waking life. Sometimes (as Jung observed) the departed seem to need help from the living, especially when they have become lost or confused, frequently because they are not aware that they are "dead." Active dreamers will develop the ability to dialogue with these spirits and help them find their right path. </p>

<h2>9. Walking the Path of Soul</h2>

<p>The greatest gift of dreaming is that it facilitates an encounter between the little self and the big Self. Active dreaming is a vital form of <em>soul remembering</em>... of reclaiming knowledge that belonged to us, on the levels of soul and spirit, before we entered this life experience. So much of the harm we do to ourselves and others stems from the fact that we have forgotten <em>who we are</em> and what we are meant to become. Dreaming, we remember... and encounter authentic spiritual guides who will help us on our paths. I remember vividly how I was taught by a vision guide who first appeared to me during a life-threatening illness in early childhood that all true knowledge is <em>anamnesis</em>, the act of remembering.</p>

<p>Dreaming, we remember our kinship with all living things and the Earth that sustains us. Dreaming we walk between worlds and remember that our spirits are starborn. As a society of dreamers, we will participate actively in the emergence of a more gifted and generous version of our species: the multidimensional human. We will come to re-vision our world of physical extension and linear time from a higher dimension and operate (sleeping or waking) in a state of multiple consciousness. We will treat others with greater compassion, knowing that we are all related and face the surface events in our lives with greater courage and generosity, knowing that they are only part of a much bigger story. </p>

<p>Creating a dreaming culture is not science fiction. It is a possible future that all dreamers can help bring into manifestation, because <em>we all dream</em> and because there are times when dreams will push through even the most hardened carapace of skepticism or materialism. Without preaching, without shouting, all of us who value dreams can give others a safe space in which to start sharing their own inner experiences. The encounter may come at a bus-stop, in a supermarket, in line at the post office or around the kitchen table, with a total stranger or a close relative who is opening up for the first time.</p>

<p>We can give those who are just beginning to share their dreams the gift of <em>validation</em>: confirmation that they are not alone, that they are not going crazy, that their dreams are not "only" dreams. We can encourage every dreamer to claim her own power, by recognizing her as the final authority on her own dreams. Without setting ourselves up as experts, we can offer the insights of frequent fliers. We can share what real dreamers know: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>We are born to fly, and in dreams we remember the soul has wings.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>This is the tenth in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> Strange coincidences keep happening, Russ, to the extent that sometimes I think chance and necessity—or the accidental and the purposeful—are actually interwoven into <em>patterns</em>, which sometimes reveal themselves in flashes, or as if through cracks that open and close again in an instant. Objects or images that appear at first glance to be wildly at variance, suddenly act like they want to conjoin, leaping along creative but invisible <em>vectors of attraction</em>—lending a mysterious inevitability to what I at first assume is essentially unstable and “accidental”. Ultimately, it seems as if a radically new “third” comes into being, with a life all its own. I know this may sound puzzling, but let’s see if I can find a <em>thread</em> through what follows, and if the results bear any fruit.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf10-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Cover of The Two and the One, by Mircea Eliade" style="width: 250px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>Two days ago I selected a book at random from my bookshelf. As I often do, I allowed my eye to drift over the book-spines until a title jumped out at me. It happened to be <em>The Two and the One</em>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a>. It was an old paperback from the early 1960s that I found some time ago at a thrift store, using the same “drifting-eye/jumping-title” method. <em>“Oh, here’s something by Eliade that I haven’t read before!”</em> So I bought it with some others, and it ended up on my shelf, unread. </p>

<p>When I finally did pick it up, two days ago, I began by scanning the <em>index</em>, for some reason, looking for a specific reference—the way you tried to find the Coming Guest in Jung’s indices. Neither did I did find what I was looking for. Instead, I was immediately struck by something else: an index-heading for “cargo cults”. I knew a little bit about cargo cults, having read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hyde">Lewis Hyde’s</a> book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift:_Imagination_and_the_Erotic_Life_of_Property">The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</a></em>, many years ago. For some reason, I thought it was interesting to find the cargo cult topic in a volume by Mircea Eliade, historian of religions. So I opened the book to page 125 and began reading.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf10-1.jpg" height="auto" alt="Cover of The Two and the One, by Mircea Eliade" style="width: 250px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>Before I knew it, Eliade was describing the “eschatological nudism” of an unusual cargo cult—one among many—that was begun in 1944-1945, on the island of Espirito Santo (now known as Vanuatu), in the New Hebrides archipelago of the South Pacific. The cult was founded by a man named Tsek, who ordained that all should go naked, that all tribal taboos should be abolished, including traditional practices surrounding marriage and funeral rites, etc., and that along with the destruction of all cultural artifacts of white European colonialism (buildings, personal ornaments, agriculture, domestic animals, tools, etc.), people should stop working for the Whites. In fact, <em>they should stop working altogether</em>. All their needs would be provided for, in abundance. Furthermore, they should practice orgiastic sexuality in the open, in daylight, without respect to marriage contracts, and without restraint or shame—like dogs or birds.</p>

<p>To an extent, this latter principle was a primitive throwback to the philosophical Greek school of the Cynics, philosophers who believed in living a life of “natural simplicity”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes">Diogenes</a>, for example, is famous for having lived in a large ceramic pot on the streets of Athens, urinating and masturbating in public, choosing to live a life of dog-like simplicity that was held to be morally superior to a life lived according to prohibitive public standards. The Cynics (from the Greek kynos, “dog”), being loyal guards like dogs, would welcome those who agreed with their philosophy, but would “bark” at those who scorned or attacked them!</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf10-2.jpg" height="auto" alt="Diogenes sitting inside a large ceramic pot" style="width: 400px; margin: auto;"/> <div class="caption"><i>Diogenes (1882), by John William Waterhouse. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#/media/File:Waterhouse-Diogenes.jpg">Wikipedia</a></i></div> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in Tsek’s cargo cult of the New Hebrides near the end of WWII, a new, unitary language called <em>Maman</em> was developed, people learned to speak it, and, in the initial stages of the cult at least, around one-third of the island’s population had joined. The reason no one would have to work was that “America” would soon be arriving on the island, delivering to the cult-members enormous, perhaps unlimited, quantities of goods. Furthermore, cult members would never die. They would live forever. And although disillusionments lay not too far off in the near future, proof that the claims of Tsek were valid, came in the form of manufactured goods that either washed up on the beaches or were dropped onto the island by parachute from airplanes. </p>

<p>At this point my reading was disrupted by secular chores. During the distractions, however, my mind was mulling over the possibility that in our own troubled age—today or tomorrow—other cultic movements equally strange, if not stranger, might sprout up as we advance further into the stormy, chaotic future that we face on so many levels. In fact, the cargo cult of Tsek didn’t seem so utterly preposterous when compared with, say, the communal living of young people in the 1960s, with their sexual “liberation” practices; or the communal cult of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones">Jim Jones</a>—the “Peoples Temple Agricultural Project”, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown">Jonestown</a>, with its final suicide pact in Guyana (the spiked Kool-Aid). Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Applewhite">Marshall Applewhite</a>, and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_Gate_(religious_group)">“Heaven’s Gate”</a> suicide cult in 1997, with its space-ship hiding behind the Comet Hale-Bopp, waiting to pick them up.<sup>⁠1</sup> Let alone the so-called “Manson Family”. Or Nazi Germany, or Pol Pot, or the Cultural Revolution of Red China. The list is long. Humans are indeed a strange species.</p>

<p>When I returned to Eliade later in the day, I opened the book not to the index but to the Foreword, where he was making a case for his small volume in the context of the “discoveries” of European scholars, explorers and anthropologists throughout much of the 19th century, and whose scornful attitudes toward the indigenous cultures they were discovering and studying—both Asiatic and “primitive”—so besmirched their scholarship. Quite certain of their self-centered Western and European superiority, they could only see in the alien Otherness of strange and exotic foreign cultures such qualities as “primitiveness”, “savagery” or “primordial stupidity”. But gradually new ways of understanding Otherness and the alien began to open up, along with new depths of appreciation for the spiritual sophistication of non-Western cultures. In Eliade’s opinion, as a historian of religion:</p>

<blockquote>“…it is [Jung’s] depth psychology that has revealed the most <i>terrae ignotae</i>, has caused the most dramatic confrontations. The discovery of the unconscious could be put on a level with the maritime discoveries of the Renaissance and the astronomical discoveries that followed the invention of the telescope. For each of these discoveries brought to light worlds whose existence was not even suspected. …When Jung revealed the existence of the collective unconscious, the exploration of these immemorial treasures—the myths, symbols and images of archaic humanity—began to approximate its techniques to those of the oceanographers and speleologists”.⁠<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

<p>Thus, euro-centric assumptions necessarily had to give way, however grudgingly, to the reality of otherness, and to the psychic pressures of <em>alien invasions</em> into their privileged midst. Eliade again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After the Second World War, an encounter with the ‘others,’ with the ‘unknown,’ became for Westerners a historical inevitability. Now, for some years Westerners have not only felt with increasing sharpness what a confrontation with ‘outsiders’ means; but have also realized that it is they who are being dominated.…For the encounter—or shock—between civilizations is always, in the last resort, an encounter between spiritualities—between religions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, as Eliade painstakingly laid out his basic premises, with one sentence the categories he was assembling suddenly collapsed forward in time, for me, taking on the form of something utterly new. Little by little—like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_Maria">alchemical Axiom of María</a><sup>⁠3</sup>—from page one came page two, from page two came page three, and from page three came page one as the fourth. This is where I was struck by an intuitive lightning-bolt, triggered by two sentences. From the end of page three to the beginning of page four of his Foreword, I read these words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is not impossible that our age may go down to posterity as the first to rediscover those ‘diffuse religious experiences’ which were destroyed by the triumph of Christianity. It is equally possible that the attraction of the unconscious and its activities, the interest in myths and symbols, the fascination of the exotic, the primitive, the archaic, and encounters with the ‘others,’ with <em>all the ambivalent feelings they imply—that all this may one day appear as a new type of religious experience.</em>” [Emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This took my breath away, Russ, in a shock of intuitive realization. What Eliade was describing as possibly being “a new type of religious experience”, could justifiably be applied to the strange vision that I reported in Q9—if only as a speck of dust in a tornado. A further implication would be that, in effect, any and all encounters with the Coming Guest, taken in their totality as manifestations of the objective psyche, may in sum constitute this “new type of religious experience”—even if the purpose of that religious experience, its telos, turns out to be a heralding of the end of human civilization, with the potential for human extinction, that we are exploring here. </p>

<p>To frame it this way suggests that your dream of the <em>Final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a></em>, and its invitation to <em>celebrate the end of humanity</em>—despite all the untold horrors that entails—might serve as yet another example of how the <em>new type of religious experience</em> could actually manifest itself in the world—a way it can be imagined taking shape. </p>

<p><em>Does Morpheus have a hand in this shaping?</em>⁠<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>While browsing through Jung’s letters recently, I came across a passage that has a bearing on this statement by Eliade. Jung was saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…I do not believe that reason can be the supreme law of human behavior, if only because experience shows that in decisive moments behavior is precisely not guided by reason but rather by overpowering unconscious impulses. There is nothing to cope with the latter but their own equivalent, something that adequately expresses their nature, gives them name and shape. There thus arises in consciousness a receptacle, so to speak, into which the unconscious onslaught can pour and wherein it can assume cultural form. If this does not happen, there is unquestionably a danger that the onslaught will express itself as cataclysmically as an avalanche. <em>This form has always been given by religion, never by reason</em>”. [Emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had read this passage by Jung <em>before</em> picking up Eliade’s book, and Jung’s passage must have been percolating in the back of my mind. I had been primed with the idea that anything of global consequence, to be capable of withstanding the destructive forces so rampant and widespread today, would have to be of a religious nature. Nor did I have any particular religion in mind. For the moment, the tabula was rasa.</p>

<p>When I later came across Eliade’s critical phrase, the two ideas, like chemicals, virtually exploded. Yes! It will take <em>something like a religion</em>—or <em>comparable</em> to a religion—to contain the outpouring of unconscious contents and energies from the objective psyche, to give them a <em>new form</em>, once the proverbial shi—no!—once the proverbial <em>chi</em>ckens come home to roost.</p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that Eliade, whose specialty was charting the <em>history</em> of religions—including pre-historical mythologies, practices and traditions—was referring here to a new <em>“type”</em> of religious experience in the future, something we have <em>never experienced before</em>—not just one more “new religious experience”, but a new <em>type</em> of religious experience. Therefore, intuitive logic tells me that Christian anticipations of the “End Times”, the “Rapture”, etc.—though apocalyptic—do not belong to this <em>brand-new type</em> of religious experience—as Eliade is using the phrase, let alone the even more radical use I am proposing for it. Rather, the Christian imaginings of End Times <em>seek to confirm the biblical view of old</em>, not to announce something never heard of before. </p>

<p>Most religious mythologies, as you’ve pointed out, Russ, portray endings as <em>always</em> leading to new beginnings, if only on different levels or in new forms. Devout Christians may acknowledge their inevitable death, for example, but only as a transitional pathway to a glorified eternity—not so far-removed from Tsek’s cargo cult.</p>

<p>What you and I have been trying to imagine here is the <em>permanent termination of our imagining species</em>, period. </p>

<p>So—throughout Q10 our course has gone from the index of Eliade’s <em>The Two and the One</em>, to Tsek’s cargo cult, from there to Eliade’s Foreword, where we encountered Western civilization’s need to open up to, and learn from, the strange, the alien, and the Other, only to land on Eliade’s dazzling words on the fourth page of his Foreword, where his image of a “new type of religious experience” revealed the possibility of a great consolation in the form of an imaginal context for approaching and enduring the Sixth Great Extinction. </p>

<p>I have re-tasked Eliade’s words, then, to serve as our <em>parakletos</em>—a Greek term meaning “one who comes to the side of”, “comforter”, “advocate”—in our deepening, global, climate-extinction dilemma, namely, how can we meet, greet and celebrate the Coming Guest, <em>the unavoidable objective psyche which contains us</em>, and whose messages some of us can witness through dreams and images that flow to us from it—as for example your “final Ragnarök” dream, or perhaps through visions like mine, of the alien, unitary figure staring at me through the drifting mist. Was it trying to get my attention?</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf10-4.jpg" height="auto" alt="Rows of white houses in Jonestown" style="width: 400px; margin: auto;"/> <div class="caption"><i>Sunset over the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca#/media/File:Strait_of_San_Juan_de_Fuca_sunset.jpg">Wikipedia</a>)</i></div> </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> It’s nearly forty years since I read Lewis Hyde’s masterful book, <em>The Gift</em>.⁠<sup>5</sup> Not long after reading it, we met in my office in Port Townsend, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, also known as the Graveyard of the Pacific. What I recall most from our conversation that afternoon, was our discussion of the origin of the phrase “Indian Giver”. As Lewis described it, when the Indian would give a Puritan a gift of a peace pipe or something similar, the Puritan took the gift as <em>property</em> and would display it as such. Later, when the Indian saw it, he took it back. The Puritan interpreted this as not being a gift at all, since its return was required. However, what the Indian responded to was the fact that the gift had not circulated, that is, the gift had not been <em>re-gifted</em> to another. The Indian’s belief was that the circulation of something essential had been broken and this would have negative implications for the community. It is useful to realize that the very word community means “gifting” (munus) “together” (com). </p>

<p>It was clear from this example that gifting was essential to the spirit of community, while property was something quite different, something that led not to community but to privilege and power. Lewis made clear that this was a simple example of property as capital and served a different purpose than gifting.</p>

<p>My argument that day was that this simple example illustrated a major leitmotif of our culture and illustrated clearly how capital was geared toward accumulation, while gifting illustrated the underlying <em>religious</em> nature of community. Moreover, I expressed the idea that our entire history since the earliest time, could be written through the lens of this disparity.</p>

<p>Prompted by your reference to <em>The Gift</em>, I was reminded of this visit with Lewis Hyde. I would argue now that this disparity between commodity culture and gift culture is even more extreme, perhaps reaching a degree where the commodity culture will begin to fracture and break down. This led to my thinking about how the commodity culture is the prime mover of denial in relation to climate change. I was set to wondering how the gift culture would be what finally emerges as how humans will be able to function as the climate catastrophe and the sixth extinction begin to manifest in ever greater degree. I do not think that the commodity culture will do anything but make everything more miserable. </p>

<p>The purpose of Hyde’s work was to show how the gift culture was at the heart of genuine art—not the commodity culture. When the commodity culture invades the realm of art it has a degrading and devaluing effect on art and artist alike. As you can see from any auction result at Christie’s or Sotheby’s, the “big news” is the money fetched—nothing about the art or artist. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf10-5.jpg" height="auto" alt="Rows of white houses in Jonestown" style="width: 400px; margin: auto;"/> <div class="caption"><i>The Microcosm of London (1808), an engraving of Christie's auction room by Thomas Rowlandson (1756–1827) and Augustus Charles Pugin (1762–1832) (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie%27s#/media/File:Microcosm_of_London_Plate_006_-_Auction_Room,_Christie's.jpg">Wikipedia</a>)</i></div> </p>

<p>I have argued in these pages and elsewhere that relating to the artistic impulse in each person is a more generative way to approach the dire issues in our future than anything to do with money or other commodity dynamics. </p>

<p>The second thing that grabbed my attention was your mention of the cargo cult that originated on Vanuatu. This cult essentially abandoned the entire commodity dimension and became a purely gift-based culture even eschewing work altogether asserting that their needs would be provided by America. And sure enough, supplies and such were washed up or air-dropped and the islanders were provided for—a <em>gift</em> from the heaven known as America. </p>

<p>You point our how these cultish practices are not so far from cultish examples from America and around the world. Eliade’s claim that we may see a “return” of the religious root of these various expressions, as if the “spirit of the time” as well as the “spirit of the depth” was lurching toward a new <em>type</em> of religious experience. Is this what Yeats was imaging in that “rough beast” as it “slouches toward Bethlehem to be born”? I would be happy to argue that this is so.</p>

<p>So, this puts the celebration of the final Ragnarök as a <em>religious</em> ritual, not just a party. It was Jane Harrison who argued that ritual was first and religion followed—an amazing insight.⁠<sup>6</sup> In this context, I believe you are right to assert that all “encounters” with the objective psyche “could” become the root of a ritual that has the potential to give rise to a new “type” of religious experience. Note how <em>personal</em> and <em>individual</em> this would be. </p>

<p>What a new <em>type</em> might be is not easy to fathom, so used as we are to the historic religions that still hold sway. It is difficult to think outside those contexts. But it is right here in this difficult-to-fathom pool that Jung expresses his idea of the coming guest. And it is likely that the disparity between this image and Jung’s final dream a few short months later is not a disparity at all, but that the coming guest is tied in some way to what Jung called the “final catastrophe”.</p>

<p>The <em>final catastrophe</em> and the <em>final Ragnarök</em> have an eerie similarity. </p>

<p>Here is a minor detail that may prove important. When Jung wrote “the coming guest” in that letter to Sir Herbert Read, he did <em>not</em> capitalize it. But in the course of two short sentences that follow, Jung capitalizes Dream. If we take this as deliberate, what is Jung trying to hint at here? </p>

<p>Well, a new type of religious experience might be found in the <em>dream as source of ritual</em>. And, Jung speaks in this section of the great dream always manifesting through the <em>artist as mouthpiece</em>. This is highly suggestive of the intertwined nature of art and dream, <em>both</em> as ritual, <em>both</em> as source of a new type of religious experience. </p>

<p>So, then, I want to suggest that as you gaze upon the visage of the alien presence, and he gazes at you, that you and he, are engaged in a <em>ritual</em> and that this is specifically the kind of encounter that has the potential of producing a new type of religious experience. </p>

<p><em>This is the eleventh in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> As usual, Russ, there is much to savor in the feast of your comments. How to choose? </p>

<p>Let’s say—I’ll close my eyes and select one example at random: i.e., your contrast between the extreme and global magnitude of our “commodity culture”, on one side, in which and to ever-increasing degrees a <em>price</em> is placed on practically everything—and Lewis Hyde’s “gift economy”, on the other—definitely a “minority report”.</p>

<p>The gift economy, as you point out, has long stood as the basis of a real community—<em>com</em>, “together” + <em>munus</em>, “gifting”—which may still exist today in isolated pockets and fragments, in the shadows of the dominant culture, so to speak. You and Hyde allude to the gift economy as a natural prerogative of artists, since their allegiance, in the best cases, is to something beyond themselves, which comes to them in the form of an autonomous “gift”, as opposed to a Puritanical piece of “property” or a “personal possession”.</p>

<p>Your observation regarding the <em>extremities of excess</em> the commodity culture is currently reaching—seeming like they must lead to an eventual fracture and breakdown, perhaps even a reversal—recalls your earlier references to the sand-pile experiment, which suggested that <em>one more grain of sand</em> is all that is required to precipitate a collapse of the entire pile. This of course is a modern day version of the old, proverbial <em>straw that breaks the camel’s back</em>—applicable to cultures, empires and civilizations, as well as to individuals. </p>

<p>However, if we ever see the point at which the commodity culture actually collapses under the weight of one more straw, or grain of sand, the <em>upheavals</em> that such a breakdown would precipitate, are almost beyond telling—grist for imaginative and dour fiction writers, perhaps. Definitely not utopians, like Tsek and his self-ordained cargo cult of 1944-45, which was supposed to result in imminent immortality—hence, Eliade’s interest in the eschatology of it.</p>

<p>The inherent tension between the <em>commodity culture</em> and <em>gift-economy cultures</em>, and especially the vast gulf that separates them, implies the possibility of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiodromia">enantiodromia</a>—“a running toward the opposite”—that we’ve spoken of before. This can be seen as a circular, cyclical or reciprocating image, like periods of financial inflation alternating with periods of deflation—the “irrational exuberance” of a bull market trend punctuated by sharp recessions or depressions, which, financial newsletter writers assure me, are indeed inevitable, just as the crest of one wave is inevitably followed by a depressive “trough”, before the next exuberant crest arrives. (The newsletter publishers and writers admit that they don’t know the timing, but they are quite willing to sell me “solutions” in their newsletters, solutions that are sure to protect me and my “assets”, guaranteed to help me “grow my wealth”.)</p>

<p>An <em>enantiodromia</em>, however, doesn’t have to have a reassuring, measurable, alternating wave-like structure, like light, or the strict pulses of alternating electrical current. It can also have a broken, irregular, linear structure, as when something proceeding in a fateful or fatal direction finally falls off the “cliff” it is inexorably headed toward.</p>

<p>This whole question reminds me of the legendary tale that Plutarch reported, of a voice from a nearby island calling out, by name, to Thamos, the Egyptian pilot of a passing cargo-and-passenger ship. The unknown voice admonished Thamos: “When you come opposite to [the island of] Palodes, announce that Great Pan is dead!”⁠<sup>1</sup> Since weather conditions permitted, when the ship passed by Palodes, Thamos carried out the demand, or plea, and shouted the news to the island’s inhabitants, that “Great Pan is dead”. Whereupon, as Plutarch said, “Even before he had finished, there was a great cry of lamentation, not of one person, but of many, mingled with exclamations of amazement”. </p>

<p>Palmer’s comment on this episode touches on the point I want to make here. In his introduction he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>“It takes a long time to kill gods, both ancient and modern …but when the last worshipper passes on to the Isles of the Blest, a whole <i>Weltanschauung</i> passes along with him, a vision which speaks of <i>Das Andere</i>, of the Other, of the unique finality of <i>Dinge an sich</i>”.⁠<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

<p>This may seem like it takes us far afield from our discussion, Russ, but to me it is quite pertinent. What you are calling the “commodity culture” could also be framed as <em>one of the principle gods of our time</em>, that is, the “God of Greed”, of endless accumulation, which may be the deep psychic force driving our compulsions to accumulate money, power, endless goods, etc. If it’s accurate to speak of the Spirit of our Times in this way, then the “death” of that “god” will indeed take a long time. Can you imagine what it will take to <em>unwind</em> the great, world-wide engine of consumption we have constructed? The last worshippers will undoubtedly have an unenviable task, having outlived their god, consigned to the miserable fate of picking through the rubble and ashes.</p>

<p>I like your notion that the gift economy could potentially be one of Eliade’s new types of religious experience. As you put it: </p>

<blockquote>This led to my thinking about how the commodity culture is the prime mover of denial in relation to climate change. <i>I was set to wondering how the gift culture would be what finally emerges as how humans will be able to function as the climate catastrophe and the sixth extinction begin to manifest in ever greater degree.</i><sup>⁠3</sup> I do not think that the commodity culture will do anything but make everything more miserable.</blockquote>

<p>I agree. And yet, I am impressed with the validity of Palmer’s observation about how long it takes for gods to be killed—i.e., a long time. When I contemplate the looming climate catastrophe, and hear all the stern exhortations to muster sufficient “political will” to build the foundations for a “sustainable future”, I have often thought about the <em>centuries</em> it took before Christianity took root in the antique soil of Rome and Greece, when religious ideas were more welcome and familiar than they are now, cf. the practice of syncretism, for example. But even then, Christianity was forced on the Roman citizens by the warlord Constantine. And the Roman Empire, despite its fading glories, nevertheless only comprised a shrinking fraction of the globe. Gods and religions don’t die overnight, as Palmer said, and the present religion of the commodity culture is of greater and deeper extent than any other to date. Thus, the Christian impulse plays itself out in what must be an accelerating version of the so-called Anti-Christ—which is not any single person, but the entirety of our unconscious impulses in service of the Great God of Greed, among others.</p>

<p>I imagine that it will fall to a minority of courageous individuals to open themselves deeply enough to the wisdom of the gift-economy and its impulses toward generosity and community, as the waters and the flames continue to rise, and the last bastions of wealth and power fight off the inevitable.</p>

<p>No one needs to remind me how “negative” this view sounds. I am all too aware of it. But I didn’t go looking for it. It came to me, as I researched deeply into what have come to be <em>the current trends</em>. </p>

<p>If, in this volume, Russ, it falls to us to speak “unflinchingly” about what we see in terms of “Endings”, then difficult things must be said, even if for some reason they prove to be seen as premature. As anyone knows who has been following the climate science, all of the predictions about “how long it could take”, are repeatedly being revised downward—i.e., closer to the present than even the most knowledgeable of scientists originally thought possible. It’s all happening “faster than we thought”. <em>Depending on where we look, scientific predictions of hundreds or thousands of years are now being recast in terms of decades. Sometimes less.</em> Notice, I am not talking about computer modeling—I’m talking about actual <em>measurements</em>. Not what could happen <em>theoretically</em>, but rather <em>what is happening</em>.</p>

<p>Jung’s comments that you have cited, about “the last 50 years of civilization” and “the final catastrophe”, were made too close to his death to be published while he was alive. Maybe that’s just as well, since there surely would have been a bitter outcry over his “negativity”, and he had already faced more than enough vicious criticism in his lifetime. </p>

<p>By the way, I find it a bit ironic that you and I have <em>not really lost</em> our innate optimism and senses of humor, despite the dark depths we are attempting to plumb here, with our topic. I’m thinking of the idea of your “Final Ragnarök” dream as an example of the new <em>type</em> of religious experience Eliade was referring to. To think of the Final Ragnarök in that way, as a new type of global religious experience, one possible pattern among many, for the last grand round of rituals, the final Potlatch, and as an example of what the coming guest might realistically entail, all this actually makes me feel …well, optimistic, after a fashion!⁠<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>As for your comment about the lower-case designation of “the coming guest” and the upper-case designation of the great “Dream”, I’d never thought about those designations that way, as being <em>intentional</em> on Jung’s part. I had written them off to old age and his headlong impetus to spit out what he had to say to Sir Herbert Read, writing his lengthy letter in longhand. But what you say makes sense. And even if it was not intentional on Jung’s part, your point makes a lot of sense anyway, as it places the greater emphasis on the Dream as the primary vehicle for the multitudinous arrivals of the coming guest—washing ashore on the beaches of our sleep, our own unofficial “cargo cult” delivering up billions of dreams every morning, like notes in bottles, to be ritually circulated free of charge. As you said, quoting Jane Harrison: first the ritual, then the religion.</p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> A strong current running through your comments, Paco, pictures a future time when the commodity culture collapses, a time when “the upheavals that such a breakdown would precipitate are almost beyond telling—grist for imaginative and dour fiction writers, perhaps”. This reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Mekas">Jonas Mekas</a>’ often quoted statement, that “civilizations perish because they listen to their politicians, and not their poets”. Mekas, perhaps the most ardent supporter of “non-commercial” cinema (and by extension all arts), was an experimental film maker as well as a poet.<sup>⁠5</sup> His observation highlights the fact that poets are imbued with imagination and politicians are imbued with power. So, I believe we are right to point to imagination as a key aspect of how to face what we all will face in the coming time. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf11-1.jpg" height="auto" alt="Satyr figure holding woman with pan pipes" style="width: 200px; margin: auto;"/><div class="caption"><i>Jonas Mekas <b>'civilizations perish because they listen to their politicians, and not their poets'</b></i>, (Photo by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6741113">Furio Detti, CC BY 3.0</a>)</div> </p>

<p>I’m also reminded that Jared Diamond’s epigraph to begin his monumental work on the collapse of civilizations is the poem “Ozymandias”, by Percy Bysshe Shelly, a poem referring to Ramses II, and how rulers and their empires—no matter how powerful—are subject to decline, decay, ruin and oblivion,⁠<sup>6</sup> until all remnants of power wash away in the sands of time.</p>

<p>One reason why it is artists such as fiction writers and poets and filmmakers that are the ones who <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> tell the story of breakdown and collapse, is that they use imagination as a <em>resource</em>. I am reminded that the title of our series is <em>Dreams, Bones, &amp; the Future</em>. This title points to the centrality of dreams and mantic processes (e.g., the “bones” of the I Ching) and their imaginal underpinnings in relation to the future. </p>

<p>But what is the nature of this relation? Are we predicting? Are we prophesying? Are we Seers? Clairvoyants? Guessers? Verbal tricksters?</p>

<p>In times past, the primary function of a prophet was <em>not</em> to foretell the future. The prophetic voice was used to “call back” wayward believers to the fold. In a way, we are using our voice to “call out” to our readers, calling them to pay attention to dreams and other such “irrational” processes as <em>resources</em> for developing ways of being with and immersed in the calamities now unfolding. We are not in the business of <em>predicting</em> the timing and nature of climate change and other such looming disasters. Those details are for science to reveal—as is being done.⁠<sup>7</sup> Nor are we seers or clairvoyants or mystics “seeing” the future, though we pay close attention to intuitions and other manifestations of the deep psyche. </p>

<p>And we do listen to dreams and we do assert the value of dreams, visions, synchronicities and myriad mantic processes, joined with imagination and creative responses as having the potential of creating ways <em>into</em> the future, <em>whatever</em> the future may hold. As best we can tell, what the future holds is collapse and the potential for human extinction. If so, some say, as depression and despair take hold, why not just kill ourselves and be done with it. As we have already said, humans are on a collective suicidal trajectory already. For whatever reason, you and I have not fallen into despair and gloom. This is partly due to our intense curiosity about what the deeper psyche is bringing to the fore rather than focusing on typical collective responses. We do see that any form of “business as usual” will not serve us, nor will hope-fed fantasies of human exceptionalism. At the very least, what we are challenging directly is what you call “The God of Greed”, essentially Money-as-God. This is the dominant religion of our time and, as you say, citing Palmer’s argument, that the death of this god will take a long time. And we know without doubt from our knowledge of history just how dangerous it can be to challenge the dominant religion. Heresy is never welcomed as a way that leads to change and transformation, even though it is demonstrably fruitful!</p>

<p>Will the necessary <em>enantiodromia</em> take a long time? Maybe yes. Maybe no.</p>

<p>To make sense of what I’m feeling I will need to unpack this. First, enantiodromia is almost always pictured in terms of something turning—eventually—into its <em>opposite</em>. This binary form of the concept has always struck me as inadequate. Recall our earlier discussion about the idea of <em>opposites</em> and the idea of <em>differences</em>. There I proposed that we would get closer to the complexity of the issues we are talking about if we worked on differences. I feel the same about <em>enantiodromia</em> which includes the idea of the <em>death of the dominant god</em> (whatever the god of the time might be). So, yes, the death of Money-as-God could take centuries before it turns into its opposite (some sort of gift or relational economy). </p>

<p>But we do not have centuries. </p>

<p>What we have is an inordinate <em>pressure</em> building that humans never have experienced. The prior history of the collapse of societies as well as religions may no longer be <em>applicable</em> in critical ways, may no longer serve as a relevant “guide” for what is coming. Yes, the collapse of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity took <em>centuries</em>! You are right about that. This pressure I am imagining is what is beginning to appear in people’s dreams, in writer’s imaginations, in the unforeseen events that shock and surprise us, and even more so, in those events and situations that are seen clearly but are denied, ignored, or untended by the powers that be in service to power. </p>

<p>But there is “something else”. </p>

<p>Something alien, something beyond the ken of human experience. </p>

<p>Readers should know that we are writing in the midst the Corona Virus pandemic of 2020, and the unprecedented rapid and major declines in the equity markets throughout the world. Economies are deteriorating as the virus makes its way around the globe, causing governments to take extreme actions to shut the virus down before potential depression takes root. The “upheavals” you referred to that are “almost” beyond telling, are now in progress. The clamor to “return to normal” is deafening. It does not appear that even this monumental crisis is enough of a “wake up call” to fully embrace the new reality. And it cannot be forgotten that while climate change has taken a back seat to the current situation, this double crisis is riding atop that even deeper and more threatening crisis that we have already indicated points to complete collapse, even human extinction. That is something homo-sapiens have never experienced.</p>

<p>We have alerted our readers to the “centrality” of dreams in dealing with “what is coming”. So, amid this unfolding, what <em>are</em> we dreaming, Paco? You have already told of your “alien” presence dream. Let me illustrate with a couple of dreams I have had in this context. In one dream, I was wondering how to write about the synchrony between the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic and the global melt down in the financial markets. A voice broke into my deliberations. It was a stern, stentorian voice announcing, “It’s all prelude!” I woke up startled by the voice—the sort of voice speaking with undoubted authority—and even more so by the message. </p>

<p>What has happened qualifies as a collapse from recent all-time market highs in February 2020, and economies grinding to a halt from rosy pictures a few short weeks ago. Politicians and Central Banks the world over are acting in unprecedented ways to deliver drastic fiscal and monetary actions<sup>⁠8</sup> and politicians are calling for a rapid “return to normal”. This is a typical response. Those in charge do not realize that it was the “normal” that was the problem, insuring inequality, denial, and rampant greed in relation to climate change and other potential cataclysms. Those in charge do not see that what has happened calls for fundamental changes in the financial system itself as well as an end to the governmental collusion in policies that are detrimental to the welfare of all and the environment and other living creatures.</p>

<p>My dream, then, alludes not to a quick <em>recovery</em> back to normal, but that the present multiple crises are a <em>prelude</em> to what is coming. The dream does not say what the current situation is a prelude to. But the dream has a deep sense of expectancy about the future that hints at something darker. That was the emotional impact of the message on me. So, given the dream image, I look to the future not with the expectation of a return to normal, but with eyes wide open looking for signs of “something else”. </p>

<p>When dreams announce, it is useful to look at subsequent dreams to draw forth the character of what is being referred to. A follow up dream arrived shortly after the prelude dream. In this dream, I was alone on an expansive sandy beach looking off to the horizon. In the distance I saw a very large wave like one might see in some locations where waves reach extreme heights. Then, as I looked, I saw a second wave rise, behind the first, this time narrower and reaching an impossible height for any natural wave. Tall and thin as if some force was drawing it “up” into the sky from the ocean. Then as I watched I saw a third wave, behind the first two, now much thinner than the second but reaching “far into the heavens”. These waves were approaching. The image was stunning, and I woke up not fearful, but with a sense of “knowing”, knowing that something totally <em>outside</em> normal reality was on the move and coming forth, exhibiting in successive waves, forces beyond comprehension.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf11-2.jpg" height="auto" alt="Whirlwind over the ocean" style="width: 200px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>The high but natural wave would come first. I sensed this might be the dream’s image of the present pandemic and financial crisis, both huge, yet quite within the realm of comprehension. We can see, or we have seen or at least known about similar or worse things in the past (The Spanish Flu of 1918, the 1929 financial collapse leading to the Great Depression). The second wave is like a tornadic waterspout. This can be extremely dangerous. It is a narrow tubular vortex rising from the water’s surface into a cloudy sky and sucking the water into the cloud as the tubular tower moves in cyclonic fashion. Perhaps this is the dream’s image of some potential danger, but from something known, perhaps an image of something climatic. In the dream, the image was of this type but far more towering than what is typical of waterspouts which are formed between the water’s surface and low-lying clouds. The dream waterspout rose much higher, hinting at something exceeding all known extremity of this phenomenon. But the third image, though narrower, rose far into the heavens, as if when it came ashore it might wrap itself completely around the world, perhaps many times. It was as if there was no end to its height. In dreams where something “impossible” happens, it is most often a signature that what will happen will be totally unexpected, out of the blue, totally unforeseen. Coupled with the prelude dream, it becomes impossible for me to embrace the “return to normal”, as a way into the future.</p>

<p>I felt with the third wave, the dream was entering into a mythic dimension, as there was nothing in nature that corresponded to this third wave.  </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf11-3.jpg" height="auto" alt="Poseidon" style="width: 200px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>Looking at the dream mythically, we see some enormous energy drawing up from the sea to the sky and beyond. Poseidon (Neptune) rules the waters and Zeus (Jupiter) rules the heavens. Poseidon is older brother to Zeus. There was no sense of opposition between the water and the sky, but some sort of conjoining, a conjunction of the powers of these mythical gods. As I reflected on this, I was reminded of Caravaggio’s famous oil painting on the ceiling of the Villa Aurora in Rome (1597). It pictures Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto, along with their animal spirits (Jupiter’s eagle, Neptune’s sea-horse monster, and Pluto’s three-headed dog, Cerberus). The painting is an allegory of alchemical processes described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>, to which Caravaggio’s patron was particularly taken. In this sense, Jupiter is sulfur, Neptune is mercury, and Pluto is salt. These are alchemical processes on a near cosmic level. </p>

<p>But there were/are three brothers. The missing brother in the image is Hades (Pluto). I began to feel a certain ominous quality in these stupendous waves; no doubt it was the unseen Hades drawing forth such a feeling. One might say the three brothers are working together in producing a hitherto unknown phenomenon. </p>

<p>These bare notes on these dreams only scratch the surface of what I was led into under their direction. As I wrestled with these images, what I became certain of was that all the “visible” realities that we are aware of and that we have written of, do not touch the unknown nature of what is coming. As we can see, all the proffered “solutions” to the current crisis, the underlying climate crisis, even the threat of extinction, are not “touching” what is coming. </p>

<p>The arrogance of the rational that says we can understand anything; the hubris of those in power that we can overcome anything and return to the ways that brought us to the brink; the unbounded hope that paralyzes the multitudes to inaction; these are the foregrounded aspects of what we see as we write. But what if we can’t understand? What if we can’t return? What if we become aware of the futility of hope? After all, hope was the last remaining evil in Pandora’s box.</p>

<p>I am reminded of Stanislaw Lem’s novel, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)">Solaris</a></em>. The central idea of this is the utter alienness of the red planet. As Lem said, “it cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas, or images”. <em>Solaris</em> is unique in this respect and I believe is one artist’s effort anticipating[ to anticipates], in some sense or other, what is coming. The potential for human extinction may fall into the category of unacceptably alien. The hint from <em>Solaris</em> is that humans may be incapable of understanding their own extinction. Even those scientists given to the direst of warnings, for the most part, mitigate their warnings with various intensities of hope, in the form of redemption, regeneration, and rebirth. The gravitational pull of this can be seen even in something as nonsensical as President Trump wanting to reopen the economy and get back to work, back to normal, on Easter, the day of the risen Christ. It is as if any possibility of “something else” cannot be. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6kdbf11-4.jpg" height="auto" alt="Satyr figure holding woman with pan pipes" style="width: 200px; margin: auto;"/><div class="caption">Cover of the first edition of Solaris (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=20699697">Wikipedia</a>)</div> </p>

<p>But the dream that that presented itself to me, the one that continues to haunt me in the deepest sense, speaks of <em>celebrating the final Ragnarök</em>. This surely is more in line with <em>Solaris</em> and the growing red spot on our volumes of <em>Dreams, Bones &amp; the Future</em>. </p>

<p>The dream source gets it. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I recently attended a gathering of Northwest Coast Native tribes on one of the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, which, in essence, was a celebration of cultural revival and a sharing of Visions through storytelling, song and dance. I was able to see with vivid clarity - as regards dreams that come for community, that are intended to be shared on that level with others - how that's creativly integrated in Native American culture. It's also helped me to see the abject poverty of our culture in this respect. We simply don't provide enough places for the 'enacting' of the dream to occur at this time.</p>

<p>I perceive, from the materials and information that come to the matrix of the Dream Network, that there is a growing desire among the general population to engage more seriously in their dreams; the satisfaction of that urge is trying to be satisfied in a variety of ways. It seems to me that what we have happening now in terms of <em>where</em> people can go with their dreams, is to private therapy with depth, transpersonal and Jungian therapists, like yourself... to dream groups or to the many individuals who cluster around the philosophy espoused by this publication... which, in essence, says that dreams are a common human experience and we do not need to rely, exclusively, on professional help to engage with our dreams and to integrate our dreams into our lives and culture. </p>

<p>I'd like now to go directly to a quote from your book, Psyche Speaks, which stimulated the request for this interview: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"To have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the times to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given your statement and given that we are demonstrating a collective, cultural urge - or impulse - toward 'enacting and incarnating psyche in the world' - how do we go about creating that bridge into the home, the community, our schools... from your perspective? What are the safest ways to bring psyche's voice 'into the world'? How can we achieve this in ways that are creative, healing and not destructive.. given that we are talking about reopening considerable repression of emotions and... soul? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> The issues that are involved are so large and in many ways so crucial, that it's difficult to know quite where to start. </p>

<p>There's a great distrust of dreams; there has been forever, to one degree or another. Dreams, I think, are relatively subversive and so they are likely to be a threat in many different ways to whatever is the established order... whether that is the established order of the personality, or of a group, or of the larger collective of society. From my point of view, almost every dream has more to do with the future than with the past. Since most individuals, groups and societies function in a preservative mode, preserving a sense of self, of identity, a sense of collective identity... there's not a lot of tolerance for anything that has the capacity to question or overthrow whatever is the established process.</p>

<p>In my mind, dreams have that function. Not just the occasional collective - or 'Big'- dream that some people have, but every dream has the potential of being a source of the future. And of course, most of the ways of working with dreams have to do with attempts to understand the dream in terms of the past. </p>

<p>A lot of good work can be done that way; it's not that I'm questioning the value of that. What I do question is whether that work serves the dream. There is no question that dreams can be used in different ways and they can be used as vehicles to work and re-work the past. I think any work that tends to do that exclusively <em>fails the dream</em>, and so I am particularly interested in how to approach the dream in ways that will listen for what the intentionality of the dream is, in terms of the future. We can't do anything about the past, anyway; we can do very little about the present. The only thing we have hope of doing something about that is different than just being determined by the past is the future. So, the future, not being known, forces- I think - a certain way of listening to the dream that is not from the standpoint of knowledge, authority, understanding and so on... but, simply listening to what the dream has to say. </p>

<p>Now that sounds very simple but, in fact, it is very difficult, because most of our attempts- whether on our own or working with someone else- tend to force the dream into some understanding that we already have. And, of course, it's much easier to pull the dream into some constructive understanding than it is to truly listen to the voice of the dream. True listening has the potential for reorganizing our whole psychology and sense of ourselves. Dreams have that potential, but it's anxiety provoking to open yourself that fully to a dream and so there are a lot of reasons for trying to bring understanding to the dream, which amounts, very often, to forcing the dream into already preconceived notions. </p>

<p>That effort of listening to the dream- and particularly to its intentionality, to its "future seeking" value-I'm not sure that is the preserve of the professionals at all. Nor am I sure whether professionals are necessarily the best people to be listening in this way. Artists listen in this way. Poets listen in this way. Perhaps I should say some artists and poets. And so these activities- art and poetry- tend to be the places where you can see what's heard that's anticipating the future, more so than what you see in professional journals. If you look closely at what's happening in some art, what's happening in some poetry and some literature, what's happening in some of these creative processes... then you can start seeing the future in a way much more clearly than you can in what is presented as overt plans for the future. Our 'plans' for the future don't work nearly as well as some of the anticipations that one sees in art and poetry. </p>

<p>One can see these anticipations of the future, as well, in the dreams and visions of people in different kinds of psychotic conditions, and in certain kinds of extreme human conditions, in certain extremity conditions altogether. And most of these things get seen as illnesses, or as problems, or only as reflecting problems... problems to be fixed, problems to be coped with or adapted to, etc. So, it's hardly surprising that where there are sources of power - whether that's political or financial power - the dream is hardly listened to in such places. </p>

<p>I think, in the present world, the dynamics of money are probably the main determinant of most of what transpires. And for that reason, it seems significant to me that I can make a great deal of money interpreting or working with people's dreams in the ways that I do. And I know a whole lot of people who can make a whole lot of money doing that. </p>

<p>But, I can't make any money from a dream. Nobody's going to pay me for a dream. If I tried to sell you a dream, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I tried to sell you a poem, you probably wouldn't buy it. If I try to sell you a dream that I think is important, that somebody just told me, you wouldn't buy it. And yet, these are the most valuable things we have. And nobody knows it. It's not that I want to be paid for my dreams; I don't. And I don't want to sell dreams. But in many ways, I believe that dreams are the most valuable things that we have and I would hope that the pervasiveness of money dynamics - as it seems to be developing in our culture - doesn't find a way to commodify dreams. </p>

<p>There are dreams that I have heard which I think people need to hear. One of the things I want to do is to try and make some kind of place for such dreams, so that these dreams can be heard. I want to do that in some way which is not going to be influenced by the dollar; I don't know how to accomplish that but it's a project I have in mind. I don't want to interpret these dreams; I don't want to write a professional or Jungian commentary about those dreams. I could surely do that, but I don't want to. I want the dreams to be heard. I would like, somehow, for the dreams to be heard all over the place! </p>

<p>So, some of the things that are going on, because of the computer network, the global highways, the ways we are able now to instantly communicate with vast numbers of people, I want to be able to use it. I don't want to sit back and just say that's horrible, because it's not. I do want to make use of computer technology as a way and means for the psyche to be heard. I think that psyche is going to be heard, in any event. The problem is whether we can hear it and get the message... or have the message forced on us. </p>

<p>The psyche doesn't stand for not being heard for very long, whether that's in an individual's life, a group's life or a culture's life. The kind of community that can be generated from genuinely hearing what's going on in the psyche is an extraordinary community. This doesn't have to be in the same place, geographically, because we're not in the same place geographically anymore. That idea is I gone. Your real community in the future is going to be with you in Utah, me in Lake Stevens, X in Nova Scotia and Y in New Zealand and somehow we are going to be able to communicate and be an organic community, even though we're not in the same place. Finding ways of facilitating that sense of community is going to be a very interesting thing to do. </p>

<p>I feel more in community with people I've never met, never seen, who are in Europe, or in Russia or South Africa, than I do with my neighbor across the road. And I can have two reactions about that: I can say that's horrible, we've got to have community right around us; but, what I've come to feel is that I don't want to insist on that anymore. First of all it's not happening organically. What is happening organically is a kind of psychic inner connection with people all over the world and I feel very connected with them. </p>

<p>Certainly, I'm not in opposition to having community close at hand in my small town, but it doesn't seem to · be happening. I don't know whether that's peculiar to me or...</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I don't believe so. I'm hearing everywhere I go that there is no such thing as community anymore, except when a crisis occurs. I am experiencing it myself. It's a great loss, whatever the causes. I wasn't I aware of how much I miss a sense of community until attending the gathering I mentioned earlier. The setting was on an island in British Columbia. There, most people do not have, nor need, cars. Every day was a celebration of people in the streets, walking and genuinely greeting one another. That in itself was incredibly nourishing and made me painfully nostalgic because that's the way it used to be... </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I'm a strong believer in the <em>organicity</em> of community. The way in which community is genuinely formed is not to press the idea of community by saying we've got to have community and kind of force it in some way. That doesn't work. Community doesn't even mean that if you think about the word. The <em>munis</em> part of that word means "gift"; the <em>comm</em> part of it means "together." So community that is organically based is based on <em>what we give</em> to each other. When you give something to another person and that gift starts circulating - that's the key thing: the circulation of gifts - then, you have community. </p>

<p>Now, where does that happen? It certainly can happen with your next door neighbor, but it often doesn't. That's why now, what I can give, is to people that are not necessarily next door. The person next door doesn't I necessarily want what I have to give and if I give it to them it doesn't circulate, it stops. So, what's required is to give in a place where the gift will keep moving. </p>

<p>Louis Hyde, in his book The Gift, a crucial book in this whole sense of things, pointed out one problem with the early Puritans is that when the Indians would give them the peace pipe, the Puritan would put it on his mantel. The gift became a <em>possession</em>. When the Indian came by the next time and saw the pipe still there, he took it. So, Indians became "Indian givers"; "you can't trust an Indian."</p>

<p>But, what the Indian was seeing was the death of community and that was very disturbing. The Indian understood that if everyone takes and possesses, we don't have community, we have power. That acquisitive power aspect, when we are in that mode, we can't give and therefore, we can't be a basis of community but only a basis of power. Communities that are based on power - that attend to the flux of power - are quite different than communities based on the flux of gifts. This is probably the most crucial thing in terms of how to find out where community is in the modern world. </p>

<p>This is why I think with the kinds of technological communication - which is, of course, the same word that this is going to make possible a vast interaction of everybody in the world ... and communities are going to be quite different than what we've imagined them to be in the past. I had a dream some years ago, one of those voice dreams, you know, that has a compelling truth quality. It said, "God is in the computer."</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> That's an awesome statement to consider. A dream voice once said to an acquaintance: "The unconscious is God." </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> It's important to notice the dream does not say the computer is God, it says God is in the computer. Now there are certainly ways in which computers function as gods, lately. You go into the bank, and if the computer's not working, nothing is happening. They can't even do anything by hand anymore. So, the computer is sort of god there. I just read a book recently called <em>The Death of Money</em>, which gives a good picture of what happens when computers a reconceived of as god and instead of the dollar bill now being god, it's electronic money that has become god. </p>

<p>Now, that's not quite the same as what my dream was saying. Because of that dream, I haven't been able to look away from what's happening in all the technological revolution, because if I trust the dream I have to trust the idea that God's in there. If God is in there, in the computer, then there's a certain sense in which the computer is a new church... or is the place where one might find God.</p>

<p>This helps me in my relationship to technology and all the things that are coming in technology. In fact, the revolution in technology, which has been based largely on processes of miniaturization, has had the corresponding effect of increasing the power of individuals. The effects of this will escalate dramatically. It's happened within the last twenty years, for the most part. It has basically rendered the idea of countries, governments, large power blocks... as being relatively ineffective, in comparison with the power of individuals. Even economically, the power of individuals is increasing. It is now possible to create wealth more quickly with the idea an individual has than organizing large masses of machinery or materials or such things. A single idea, now, can produce more wealth almost instantly than a generation of 'stuff!' </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Stuff... from the Industrial era? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> That "stuff" was characteristic of the industrial era and now we are changing into an information era. It's a knowledge revolution and knowledge is really the basis of power. You can't bomb knowledge. Once all the factories and means of production become robotized anyway, there's not going to be much point in bombing them. The whole idea of large bombs is going away and with it, of course, what it has supported. The huge global structures of war are becoming obsolete. We are in the process of seeing the obsolescence of large scale governments and, of course, in the process of that there is total chaos! That, coupled with the breakdown of what <em>has</em> contained so much, historically - institutions, traditions and so forth - leads to the present chaos. This situation, I think, often generates a kind of nostalgia and so we're trying to put things back together the way they were and... </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> They won't fit!</p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Exactly... and there's no going back. That going back is also related to trying to relate to the dream by dealing with it with what we already know. The past. I'm not so sure that embracing the future works by embracing the past. I don't think, for example, that the means of understanding the coming times are necessarily going to come by trying to interpret it in terms of what's already past. </p>

<p>Using, for example, Greek mythology. Greek mythology was the stories of the Greeks as the psyche was then producing stories and art. Why would we want to take just those stories and say these are the stories of the psyche when the <em>psyche is producing stories all of the time.</em> New stories, different stories. Obviously, some with the same themes... but in new contexts. It's more a point, now, of trying to sensitize ourselves to what is coming and how to embrace the future, rather than being fearful about it. These things that are being developed are the tools of the future and like any tool, you can hit somebody over the head with it or you can do something creative with it. </p>

<p>So, the problem we have is still the same problem. We have to have a kind of psychological development that is up to the development of the tools, or we're going to have a massive problem. And this, I think, is probably the source of much of the problem: the disparity between where the tools and the power are and where most people are. Many people in the world are still living 200 or maybe 2000 years ago. Living 10 years ago is dangerous to your health! D</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> I would like to get some clarifications for <em>Dream Network</em> readers on what you've said so far because you are introducing some new, timely and viable ways of looking at things. You are saying that we must listen to the dream as a way of embracing the future. Do you include all dreams?</p>

<p>There are now people who are identifying different <em>types</em> of dreams... such as precognitive dreams being those which show us a future event or condition ... but I hear you saying that you are listening as though all dreams are giving us guidance into future time. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. What I would like to propose is that all dreams, regardless of their seemingly different types, are ways into the future, are preparing for the future. This is something I'm in the process of working on in a book I'm currently writing. It may seem a bit odd as a way of looki ng at the dream but conceiving the dream this way brings up the question of how one is to relate to the dream and, again, putting things in an extreme form as a way of making a point, all dreams are to be enacted. Now that seems a bit dangerous and radical... </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> And challenging! </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. Some might say stupid. If you have a dream that you go over and kill your neighbor, does that mean you go over and kill yo ur neighbor? Is that what I mean by enacting? Obviously, that's not what I mean. Talking about every dream as having something to do with the future, does not mean that one becomes a slave and simply act out the dream. There's a world of difference between acting out and enacting and this is the crucial point. Enacting the dream requires <em>consciousness</em>. A conscious relationship to the dream, a kind of eros with the dream. This is totally absent when one is simply acting out the dream. And that's the chief difference between what one might see as a dangerous suggestion... that one just go act out what the image of the dream has shown. That's not enacting the dream at all. At the same time, when the dream pictures you killing your neighbor, what do you suppose it could possibly be to enact such a dream? What would that look like? What would you do? </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> First of all, make a determination about what the dream means. Who is the neighbor? What does the neighbor symbolize? If one were to look at the neighbor subjectively, he or she would no doubt be showing some aspect of oneself that needs to be disposed of. If looked at objectively - if there is, in fact, a serious problem with the neighbor, some righteous conflict resolution appears to be in order. </p>

<p>I understand what you are asking. I encounter this all the time... peole who are so inclined toward the quick explanation, toward the literal interpretation of dreams. That's one danger we face, it seems, as more people become interested, considering that by far the majority of people will not or cannot access someone who is in a professional capacity. The concern becomes how to educate, how to get the information out, in order that people are led to the quality resources, to the right information. This, so that we may begin doing what really is <em>simple and intuitive</em>, but since we have been deprived of - and are just in the process of reclaiming - this precious side of our nature, it becomes a considerable and sometimes lengthy process. Providing quality information, education and resources are joyful and immense responsibilities for all of us who are involved. </p>

<p>Before I ask the next question, I'd like to reflect a bit on what you've been sharing. First, I totally agree that we are in a position, maybe for the first time... maybe... in the history of the human species on this planet, where we really don't have any precedents in history - even yesterday - which can help us move into tomorrow, into the future. What you are introducing is a new concept, that we must begin recognizing that the time for reaching into the past - into the places where the woundings have occurred - need, now, to become those transformative experiences which become our personal mythology. Those which can carry us into the creation of a new way. It seems that this is our challenge... in the midst of the present-day chaos. </p>

<p>You have indicated, in response to the question of psyche's voice being heard in the world, that the kind of messages we're receiving from psyche, those that are ready to be heard out in the world, are the dreams that don't want or need to be interpreted. Are you saying that if is the dreams, which Jung referred to as coming from the level of the collective unconscious, that are ready to be heard ? </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Let me say a couple of things about this. I would like to say that every dream needs to be heard. What I mean first of all is that the dreamer needs to hear the dream. The dreamer needs to listen to what the dream is saying. That's the first place of hearing is the dream. A lot of people don't hear their dreams, so, there's a whole part of a person's life that they're not hearing. There is a collective task to get people hearing their dreams. I encourage everyone to listen to their dreams... so, that's the first place of hearing and it's very deficient at the moment. </p>

<p>As many people as are interested in dreams, or who are in therapy at this time, there is really very little of it going on in the world. That's the first place of hearing that needs to be animated. I mean, we compulsively go to the TV or the movies or whatever and we already have a theater going on inside us all the time. And it's free! It's one of the few things that the economy hasn't quite insinuated itself into, as yet. Although, in many ways it is, because we are so distracted by the economics of TV and movies and everybody's desperately involved in those things, when there's a whole source of such things going on inside that doesn't cost a dime! </p>

<p>So, there's that first place of hearing. Every dream needs to be heard. That creates the channel, as it were, for the objective psyche, or the divine or whatever one wants to call it, to come in. I don't care what one calls it, there is something there to be heard from. No matter how prosaic any dream seems, it's the beginning of a hearing of <em>something else</em> and it's that something else that needs to be heard. </p>

<p>I wouId go so far as to say every dream needs to be told. And how do you tell it? Well, first of all, you have to <em>tell it to yourself</em>. Just hearing it is one thing but telling it to yourself is another. And by telling, here, I mean an act of consciousness with the dream that has certain features. One must <em>really become curious</em> about the images of the dream. That one goes into the dream again, perhaps imagining or allowing the dream to work on us in our waking life, not just in our sleeping life but in our waking life and allowing it to work on us in such a way - what Jung called "Dreaming the dream onward," or technically, active imagination, which itself is a very difficult thing to achieve. Basically, the idea is that it's a way of <em>participating in the dream consciously</em>. It is an act of consciousness of taking oneself into the dream world again and being there, but being there with consciousness now. That's another step one takes with the dream. There are many steps. </p>

<p>One can make something from the dream, manifest the dream somehow in the world. Even the dream where one kills one's neighbor. If the dreamer were to paint this image of killing the neighbor, I can guarantee you that things would start stirring that s/he didn't know were there... that s/he needs to know are there, for their future. To enact the dream in a painting and let the paining speak to us and let all the actions that are involved in painting speak to us... brings up all sorts of things that are the stuff of our future. </p>

<p>So, there are many ways of enacting the dream and many ways of telling the dream. Telling our dreams to our partners ... and I don't mean 'dumping' the dream... I don't mean saying the dream to someone else as if they're then supposed to do something with it. We can't really tell the dream until we've heard the dream as fully as possible. </p>

<p>If we dream and wake up and tell our partner... nothing has happened. We haven't heard the dream deeply enough in order to tell it deeply enough. We've just put it on a conveyer belt and sent it along. That's not what I mean by telling a dream. Hearing is a very deep inner process and telling from that place of hearing so deeply about any dream, it has an inductive effect on the other person. It's related to the kind of art, for example, when we see it, it produces the urge to paint or to write-not the urge to possess - but the urge to create. When art has that effect, then art is serving its purpose for the future. It's bringing the fruit of the future by doing that. Our dreams are the same way. Putting a dream on a conveyer belt and sending it out, that's not what I mean. If we hear it deeply enough and tell from that deep place, then we induce an erotic connection to the other. That kind of telling is very erotic and it is what makes for very deep relationship. </p>

<p>A community that comes from that kind of sharing, giving the gift of a dream to another... after one has heard it as deeply as possible... to me, that is the idea I sequence of things in bringing the dream to the world. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> In that way it relates to the community of giving that you were referring to earlier. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Yes. And so, I think that the age of Aquarius being upon us, it's useful to use the imagery of Aquarius as being characteristic of what this might mean. Aquarius is a waterbearer. It is not quite clear whether Aquarius is male or female and so gender is not so much an issue. The issue is the bringing of the water. What I imagine this to be - and where the dream is the vehicle - is that, opening ourselves as deeply as possible to the other is the way we can fill the jug. Then, we take that jug to the common pool and we pour that jug into that calm pool made of these pourings of each of us. That is the water of community. Our gift to the common pool. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> Sounds like soul food to me! </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> Soul food it is. Dreams are free and they have to be freely given. The community that generates out of that, the gift giving of that, is going to be something we've never seen before.</p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> It reminds me of what Kilton Stewart brought to us about the Senoi people. I recognize that what Stewart shared has been questioned. .. but the paradigm is viable. </p>

<p><strong>R.L.:</strong> I don't care whether Kilton Stewart's work is a fantasy! The ideas are psychologically correct. They are good images for what is necessary in the times to come. That we go to that place of psyche and bring from there the gift to the community. </p>

<p><strong>R.O.:</strong> So be it. Thank you, Russell.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>If we could fold time, travel forward a century or two and then look backward, I believe we would find abundant confirmation that the rise of the dreamwork movement is one of the most important developments of the modern era.</p>

<p>In my brighter vision of what is to come, our society will be guided by dream helpers who are dreaming with and for the Earth itself. Their constant work is to help those around them to use dreams for guidance and healing, as a direct line to the God/Goddess we can talk to. Dream helpers play a central role in health care; now it is recognized that dreams diagnose problems before they manifest and that dream imagery and conscious interactive dreaming offer vital tools for healing. Dreamworkers help the dying to prepare for the afterlife journey by following the path of the soul in dreams; in this way they learn to go through the swing-door of death with confidence and grace. In the workplace, the day begins with dream leaders helping colleagues to share their dreams and to grow community visions. In our schools, our children become storytellers, communicators and creators by sharing and giving creative expression to dreams, and get credits for doing this. </p>

<p>In this happy future, dream guides are valued because they midwife creativity and healing. Above all because it is understood that they help us to connect with soul and recognize that this is vital to our survival as an evolving species in balance with our environment. Dream travelers are respected because it is now common knowledge that they have direct access to the flux of consciousness that particle physicists found to lie at the heart of matter—more specifically, to the ‘hidden’ six or seven dimensions of the multiverse identified by superstring theory, even before the end of the 20th century. </p>

<p>In my darker vision of what is to come, I see dream travelers and dreamworkers helping to rebuild our world after a catastrophe. In spontaneous dreams and visions over many years, I have found myself traveling into a possible future in which an order of priestess-scientists are trying to repair the havoc caused by the ignorance and violence of men of power who did not listen to dreams. The dream priestesses of the future have perfected the arts of community dreaming and group dream travel, and have been able to access immense sources of energy and knowledge at the heart of subatomic space. Dreaming, they reach out to educate and inspire those who will help humanity to find its way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a recent dream, <em>I found myself voyaging into the world of the Kogi, a dreaming people who live on a sacred mountain in Colombia and succeeded in isolating themselves from the outside world until the 1980s. I made my dream journey to the Kogi at the invitation of a friend who had spent many months with them and had brought me a personal message from one of their shamanpriests. I met a being who showed himself first as a giant bird, then as a man in a conical hat. I saw vivid scenes of his people on the mountain they regard as the heart of the world. Then he opened a vision gate for me, inside the dream. To my surprise, I found myself looking at seemingly ordinary, middleclass Americans going about their daily business. I was catapulted into the mind of one of them and I was horrified. Here was a decent family man, trying to do his best, in utter ignorance of what is happening to the forests and the seas, of the psychic forces that breed hatred and violence, and of the nature of the soul. In that moment, I understood the immense cost of our Western ignorance, from the point of view of an indigenous dreaming people. And I knew that the return of the dreaming ways is the antidote.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreamworkers may follow many different approaches to dreams, but by my observation they agree on the following: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dreams are important! </p></li>
<li><p>The only ‘expert’ on a dream is the dreamer. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreams connect us to sources of guidance that are wiser than the everyday mind. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreamers should help each other, wherever possible, to open a safe and sacred space where dreams can be shared and the dreamer can be offered non-intrusive feedback and guided to take appropriate action to honor the dream. </p></li>
<li><p>Dreaming is for the community as well as the individual. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>We need many more dream helpers from all walks of life, contributing a panoply of rich and varied perspectives, personalities and life experiences, to bring the gifts of dreaming to people where they live. </p>

<p>The next step, it seems to me, is very simple, and hugely important. If we are going to become a dreaming society again, we need ways to make it easy and safe — and fun — to share dreams with other people anywhere, anytime. Our first service to others, as dream helpers, is to confirm and validate other people’s dream experiences, and to encourage them to claim the full power and energy of their dreams. And we need to be able to do this in the thick of the hurry-sickness and manifold distractions of contemporary life. </p>

<h2>Lightning Dreamwork</h2>

<p>Over many years of teaching and practice, I have evolved the simple and powerful method for everyday dream sharing that I call <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em>. Like lightning, it is very fast and it focuses extraordinary energy. In the workshops, we allow just 8 minutes for the whole process to be applied to a single dream. This does not mean that we can’t spend an hour — or a day — with a dream when we have time and the dream invites that depth of exploration. It does mean that when we use this process we always have time to share our dreams, no matter how busy our lives may be. </p>

<p>The <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em> process makes it possible to share dreams and receive helpful feedback just about anywhere: in the office, the E.R., at the family breakfast table or in the checkout line at the supermarket. The guidelines make it easy to share dreams with complete strangers or with intimate friends and family. </p>

<p>This process incorporates the ‘if-it-were-my-dream’ protocol for commenting on someone else’s dream developed by <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>, which has been a tremendous gift to dreamworkers all over the map.</p>

<p>There are four key steps in the Lightning Dreamwork process. I have written the instructions as if you are working one-on-one with the dream. In a dream circle, one member would play ‘lead partner’ in guiding the process, with the others contributing their suggestions and associations in the ‘if-it-were-my-dream’ phase. </p>

<h2>Step One: Telling the Dream as a Story with a Title</h2>

<p>The dreamer tells the dream as simply and clearly as possible. The dreamer should always be encouraged to leave out his/her autobiography, and tell the dream as a story, complete in itself. When we do this, we claim our power as storytellers and communicators. We also avoid the appearance of giving a license to others to probe into our personal lives, which must never be permitted in dream sharing. The dreamer should be encouraged to give the dream a title. It’s amazing how the deeper meaning and shape of dream experiences jump into high relief when we do this. </p>

<h2>Step Two: The Partner Asks The 3 Vital Questions</h2>

<p>If the dreamer has forgotten to give the dream a title, the partner should ask him/her to make one up. The next step is for the partner to ask three key questions: </p>

<h3>Question 1: How did you feel when you woke up?</h3>

<p>The dreamer’s first emotional reactions to the dream are vital guidance on the basic quality of the dream and its relative urgency.</p>

<h3>Question 2: Reality check</h3>

<p>The reality-check question is designed to establish whether the dream reflects situations in waking life, including things that might manifest in the future. Dreams often contain advisories about the possible future, and it is important not to miss these messages. By running a reality check, we help to clarify whether a dream is primarily (a) literal (b) symbolic or (c) an experience in a separate reality. In practice, the dreamer may need to ask several specific reality check questions focusing on specific elements in the dream. Here are a couple of broadbrush reality-check questions that can be applied to just about any dream: - Do you recognize any of the people or elements in the dream in waking life? - Could any of the events in this dream possibly happen in the future? </p>

<h3>Question 3: What would you like to know about this dream?</h3>

<p>This simple question to the dreamer provides a clear focus for the next step. </p>

<h2>Step Three: Playing the ‘If it were My Dream’ Game</h2>

<p>The partner tells the dreamer, ‘If it were my dream, I would think about such-and-such,’ The partner is now free to bring in any associations, feelings or memories the dream arouses, including dreams of their own that may contain similar themes. Often we understand other people’s dreams best when we can relate them to our own dream experiences. </p>

<p>It is very rewarding to receive a totally different perspective on a dream, so sharing in this way with strangers can be amazingly rich, as long as the rules of the game are respected. One of those ironclad rules is that we never presume to tell someone else what a dream means for them; we say only what it would mean for us, if it were our dream. </p>

<h2>Step Four: Taking Action to Honor the Dream</h2>

<p>Finally the partner says to the dreamer, “How are you going to honor this dream?”... or “How are you going to act on the guidance of this dream?” Dreams require action! If we do not do something with our dreams in waking life, we miss out on the magic. Real magic consists of bringing something through from a deeper reality into our physical lives, which is why active dreaming is a way of natural magic ñ but only if we take the necessary action to bring the magic through. Keeping a dream journal and sharing dreams on a regular basis are important ways of honoring dreams and the powers that speak through dreams. But we need to do more. </p>

<p>Turn a dream into a bumper sticker. This is always helpful. When we write a personal motto from a dream, we not only distil its teaching; we begin to bring its energy through. Create from a dream: turn the dream into a story or poem. Draw from it, paint from it, turn it into a comic strip take a physical action to celebrate an element in the dream, such as wearing the color that was featured in the dream, traveling to a place from the dream, making a phone call to an old friend who showed up in the dream use an object or create a dream talisman to hold the energy of the dream: A stone or crystal may be a good place to hold the energy of a dream, and return to it. Perform the dream through spontaneous dance or theatre use the dream as a travel advisory: If the dream appears to contain guidance on a future situation, carry it with you as a personal travel advisory. Go back into the dream to clarify details, dialogue with a dream character, explore the larger reality and have marvelous fun! In my workshops, we practice dream re-entry with the aid of shamanic drumming and enter each other’s dreamspace (with permission!) as trackers, to support the dreamer’s journey and to bring through additional guidance. Share the dream with someone who may need the information. </p>

<h2>To the Place of the Heart</h2>

<p>Sharing dreams in this way opens paths to limitless adventure and healing. Once we have mastered the Lightning Dreamwork process, we can play the role of dream helpers and dream ambassadors (quite literally) on any street corner. </p>

<p>We soon find that dreams bring us, and can bring our communities, back to the place of the heart. When I was teaching in California in October 2002, I found myself in a dream that made this very clear: </p>

<h2>Mountain Lion Pulls Me Up to the Place of the Heart</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am climbing a steep cliff, carrying a small white box. The cliff is hard to scale, but someone at the top lowers a beaded strap to me. When I grasp it, I am startled to see that the other end is held by a mountain lion. The mountain lion pulls me up, immensely higher than I had expected, until I am on a lofty peak with a commanding view over the coastline and nearby towns and forests. Now the lion directs me to open the box, and I take out a beating red heart. When I place it on a boulder at the summit, the heart beats steadily and powerfully. I know that the heartbeat is reaching people across a great distance. I feel the heartbeat shepherding them towards healing rhythms in their lives, and recalling them to the wisdom of the heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shared this dream with a circle I was leading. We did more than discuss it. We agreed to travel inside it, in a conscious group journey assisted by shamanic drumming. We climbed the mountain to receive healing and guidance in the realm of the animal guardians and the place of the heart. The heart center is where we find courage, and reconnect with what truly matters. Our role, as dream helpers, is to encourage each other to go there, and move beyond our conflict and confusion to the heart of the world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>This historic meeting took place on June 16 and 17, 1984 at the Metropolitan Club in San Francisco, California. Approximately 125 persons from all areas of the country and from such widespread geographical locations as Ecuador, Belgium and Japan attended. </p>

<p>On the evening prior to the convention, Gayle Delaney and her husband, Steve Walsh, served as hosts for an informal reception at their home. After the Saturday morning program opened with a welcome by Dr. Gayle Delaney in her role as the President of the ASD, presenters gave papers on dreams and insight, the importance of dreams in psychotherapy, definition dream analysis, lucid dreams, dreams and synchronicity, and dreamwork in educational settings. The day's events ended with the keynote presentation of 160 slides by Dr. Van de Castle. </p>

<p>On Sunday, the papers dealt with archetypal dream work, innovations in community dream work, dreams in the Christian tradition, dream reflections and creative writing, the perceptanalytic dream system, dreams and the shamanistic tradition and anthropological studies of the dream. The final presentation was by <a href="../@henryreed">Dr. Henry Reed</a> on dream realization. </p>

<p>The long lunch breaks and Saturday supper time provided an opportunity for participants to exchange viewpoints about the papers or personal experiences with dreams. Near the conclusion of the convention, audience input was invited regarding reactions to the convention and suggestions were requested about the format for next years convention. Before closing, Gayle thanked her large crew of volunteers, the conventioneers thanked Gayle, and gave her a standing ovation in appreciation of her diligent efforts to get the convention organized. </p>

<p>Then Melodie sang a beautiful a capella dream song and the group silently held hands in a circle. Participants reluctantly left amid promises to renew the many newly discovered friendships they had developed when the next ASD convention gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia. </p>

<p>The next ASD conference will be held June 19-23, 1985 at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia. Participants will be housed in inexpensive, air-conditioned dorm suites on the beautiful West Lawn of the original grounds designed by Thomas Jefferson. Plans are being developed to include a wide range of research, clinical and theoretical papers as well as discussion panels during the daytime program. The evening programs will offer opportunities for small group meetings to share in educational and brief experiential workshops. Large scale dream induction and telepathic studies involving all interested persons are also being planned. Books on dreams and other educational materials such as tv tapes will be available and there will be a display of dream-inspired creative products (art, sculpture, etc.). </p>

<p>There will be pre-convention one and two day experiential workshops offered by a variety of leaders such as Henry Reed, Bob Van de Castle, Gayle Delaney, Stephron Williams, and <a href="../@montagueullman">Monte Ullman</a>. There will be a welcoming party on Wednesday evening before the convention officially opens on Thursday morning. It would be helpful in estimating projected attendance if persons who think they might attend would drop a postcard indicating their interest or intent to the arrangements chairman:</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The traditional dream teachings of India can offer dreamworkers of the West exciting and thought-provoking new ideas regarding the nature, function, and potential uses of dreams. India has one of the richest and most vital cultures in the world - a culture which, rather than crumbling in the face of "progress", is reacting to the West as it has to many other empires throughout history, by absorbing the foreign elements into its own flourishing world. The people of India have had a long and deep interest in dreams, with the first writing about dreams coming in 1200 b.c. in the sacred Hindu text the Rig-Veda. These remarkable people can tell us much about the mysterious experiences of our sleeping selves. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, little study has been done so far on this subject. However, the few sources on Indian understandings of dreams we do have are highly suggestive, revealing views very different from those generally accepted in the West. </p>

<p>In 1984 Wendy D. O'Flaherty published <em>Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities</em>, a wonderfully entertaining discussion of the myths, stories, and theories about dreams in India and in the West<sup>1</sup>. She begins the book by noting how one of the most intense mythic experiences is that of suddenly falling into confusion about what is real and what is not. Dreams are one of the major sources of this experience, O'Flaherty finds, and she says that in myths and teachings about dreams we can see expressions of how people have tried to understand our most basic relations to reality. </p>

<p>To defend against this type of confusion Western philosophy and psychology have tended to draw sharp lines between "hard" and "soft" reality, and thus have defined waking life as "real" and dreams as "illusory." But O'Flaherty says that in India these distinctions are not built up so quickly, and the ambiguities are not ironed out so anxiously. If two ideas clash, Indians believe that "both may be true." In India waking life is not the only reality, nor are dreams entirely - the truth lies somewhere in between. </p>

<p>Many of the myths about dreams which O'Flaherty examines express the important Indian doctrine of "maya". While maya is often translated as "illusion," O'Flaherty argues that this is not quite accurate: "To say that the universe is an illusion (maya) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made." She points out how the same verb in Sanskrit (Srj) means "to dream" as well as "to create" or "to emit". Dreams in India are seen as revealing this fact of maya to us, the fact that life is neither real nor unreal but is instead best understood as continual projection, as something being ever newly created, transformed, metamorphized. </p>

<p>O'Flaherty recounts the variety of lively myths and stories about dreams in Indian culture - the romantic adventures of travelling through the dream world for surreptitious liaisons with beautiful princes or princesses; the confusing tales of dreamers discovering that they are actually parts of other people's dreams; and the legends of dreams containing portents and omens for the future which come true. O'Flaherty suggests that these stories reveal how Indians reject any fixed boundaries to reality. Indians conclude that "what we must settle for instead are tendencies, directions of movement, and processes of reality and unreality." Dreams in India are not disparaged as illusory nonsense best forgotten upon wakening, but are rather revered as valuable symbols illuminating the deepest truths about reality. </p>

<p>Another fascinating glimpse into the world of dreams in India comes in the book Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors (1982), by Sudhir Kakar<sup>2</sup>. Kakar's unique background makes this work particularly interesting. He was born in India, came to the West to be trained as a psychoanalyst, and then returned to India to practice psychoanalysis and to study and compare the healing traditions of East and West.</p>

<p>One of the stories Kakar tells in his book is about a young Indian man named Sundar who comes to Kakar complaining of frequent quasi-epileptic attacks. Since the attacks have no apparent physical cause, Kakar begins asking about Sundar's family relations. Sundar describes a recurrent dream he has had since childhood: "I am sleeping on my bed when a shadow attacks me. I fight against the shadow but fall down from the bed. My mother picks me up. When I wake up I feel tense, as if I have been in a fight." Kakar interprets the dream as expressing a guilty rage Sundar feels toward his father combined with an oedipal attachment to his mother. But when Kakar presses him for further details, Sundar is seized by attack, the session ends and Sundar soon breaks off the analysis. </p>

<p>Sundar turns for help to one of India's numerous traditional healers, a poor, aged Muslim named Baba. Kakar portrays Baba as a wise, sensitive and good-natured man who, despite his filthy mosque "office" and his rather eccentric behavior, has tremendous healing talents. </p>

<p>When Sundar arrives Baba asks his standard opening question to his visitors: "What do you see in your dreams?" As Sundar hesitates, Baba continues, "Do you see a woman, a man, a child, a snake or a monkey or any wild animal in your dreams?" Sundar tells of his recurrent dream. "Aha, the shadow is a bala (a demon) that is attacking you", Baba confidently announces. He takes a bottle of water, recites some Koranic verses over it, and tells Sundar to drink a little of the water every day. Sundar's attacks rapidly decrease in frequency, and Kakar concludes with admirable humility, "as far as a quick cure of this particular patient's symptoms is concerned, I must admit that the score stands: demonology, 1; psychology, 0." </p>

<p>What should we make of this story? Kakar tries to defend his diagnosis by asserting that, despite Baba's "intuitive, unconscious awareness of a dream's symbolic significance," the holy water worked only because it symbolically purified Sundar's oedipal guilt and rage. </p>

<p>However, I believe the differences run deeper than this. Kakar (and Freudian psychoanalysis in general) sees both dreams and psychosomatic symptoms as devious masks concealing unconscious urges. In Sundar's case this urge is his oedipus complex. But Baba recognizes that dreams may try to express meaning rather than to hide it. When Kakar asks Sundar about his troubles, Sundar tells of his dream; Kakar's psychoanalytic interpretation fails to answer the unconscious expression, so Sundar's attack tries to communicate it more strongly - the attack says, "No, that's not what I mean, this is!" Sundar goes to Baba, and Baba does understand the dream. He answers symbol with symbol, speaking back to the dream in its own language - "Aha, a bala is attacking you" - and now that true communication with Sundar's unconscious has been established his problems can be cured. </p>

<p>In Kakar's book, then, we have a picture of a vigorous dream therapy tradition in present-day India more than holding its own against the West; in O'Flaherty we trace India's fascination with dreams back through thousands of years of myths and stories. O'Flaherty discusses how dreams in India are believed to illuminate profound truths about ultimate reality, while Kakar looks at the ways Indians use dreams to deal with personal problems in daily living. </p>

<p>The intriguing hints in these two books can only make us more eager to explore the strange but insightful understandings of dreams in India. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>The word "myth" has been tainted by common usage in which it has come to refer to a falsehood. This is unfortunate for each of us as individuals and for society in general. Rather than being judged as "true" or "false," mythology can be best thought of as a way of making sense of reality - an interpretive tool. As such, a myth can be judged only insofar as it is functional or dysfunctional for positive growth and development at a particular point in time for a given individual, family, or group. </p>

<p>Just as each culture organizes reality according to its mythology, each individual also views his or her life through a unique mythological lens. As we move through life, we are called upon to update our basic mythological understanding of the world. Accepting that our conceptions of reality are mythical in nature makes it easier for us to revise and reformulate old ways of thinking rather than to feel pressured to defend outdated views. Our personal mythologies, therefore, are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>

<p>We can think of our personal mythology as including all the interacting and sometimes conflicting thoughts and feelings we consciously and unconsciously have about our world. These thoughts and feelings shape our comprehension of what the world is and of our place in it, and they help determine the actions we will take as we live our lives. Although our myths do not always engage our conscious mind, they are always intimately affecting our lives. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it. Because dreams appear to synthesize one's existing mythic structures with the data of one's life experiences, any incongruity between these elements is often presented to us in dream content. It appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>

<p>Indeed, personal myths appear to form in a manner that is parallel to the way dreams develop. We can hypothesize that personal myths and dreams are both related to the brain's propensity for language and narrative structure. Humans have often been described as "meaning-seeking animals." Our personal myths may be a way for us to find meaningful structure in our experience, while dreams perform the same function with the torrent of images and feelings welling up from the unconscious every night. As <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> has written, "Our dreams serve as corrective lenses which, if we learn to use them properly, enable us to see ourselves and the world about us with less distortion and with greater accuracy." The same can be said of our personal mythology. </p>

<p>Since our personal mythology has its roots in the ways we learned to make sense of our world during childhood, there is frequently a conflict in one's personal mythology which is affecting one's feelings, thoughts or behavior. A mythic crisis is apparent in regard to personal development. This crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. When this occurs, the psyche is in conflict as each competing myth becomes a psychological entity attempting to dominate particular situations with its particular modes of perceiving and responding. </p>

<p>While personal myths shape our awareness, they themselves operate largely outside of ordinary consciousness. It is possible, however, to willfully bring many aspects of our personal mythology into our awareness. Because it is the nature of dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of behavior dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness. Awakening to the mythic dimension of our lives is to achieve the freedom to inspect and revise that wh ich for most people controls them unaware. </p>

<p>We can develop a categorization system which describes several aspects of dreams in this ongoing dialectic. A particular dream may include one or more of the aspects outlined below. For people who have learned to understand inner events in terms of personal mythology, this can be a useful framework for understanding their dreams. </p>

<p>• The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>emphasizing past experiences which provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li>

<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth</li>

<li>providing visions of a future dominated by the old myth - a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.</li>

</ol>

<p>• Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>

<li>interpreting new experiences in this manner and/or accommodating the old myth to fit new experiences in a manner that corresponds more closely to the counter-myth;</li>

<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities; while inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>

</ol>

<p>• The dream may facilitate a cognitive integration between the two myths. As ongoing experiences bring the two toward a compromise, they become more compatible, an integration of essential elements of each becomes possible, and the cognitive forces that work against conflict begin to integrate the two myths. This process is suggested in dreams which:</p>

<ol type="a"> 

<li>highlight experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li>

<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experiences and show ways of resolving it;</li>

<li>portent a future where the conflict is resolved, often instructing us in how to accomplish the resolution.</li>

</ol>

<p>Feeling tone often gives a clue as to the function of the dream. "Old myth" dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining in terms of energy and vitality. "Counter-myth" dreams typically tend to feel hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating. "Integration" dreams tend to produce a calm positive, realistic feeling. </p>

<p>In summary, dreams can play an important role in presenting the personal mythic structure to the dreamer. Dreams can itemize each aspect of our personal mythology and can point out when an old personal myth has become inadequate for life's current issues. The dream can point out when personal myths have become outdated, can provide a dialectical encounter between old and new myths, and can mediate conflicts between myths even providing new mythic structures and facilitating synthesis. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>In <a href="../bcpov6kmyth1">Part 1 of this article</a> (Dream Network, Vol. 17 No. 3), we presented some concepts and techniques you can use to recognize several different types of dreams and to understand what they might be suggesting about the evolution of your personal mythology. In Part II, we will demonstrate how some of these techniques might be applied using as our example a dream report contained in a popular song by The Beatles: "A Day in the Life." But before we begin the dream appreciation, allow us a brief recapitulation of the basic points we covered in the first part of this article. </p>

<p>Our personal mythologies are our ever-changing systems of complementary and conflicting personal myths. A personal myth is a cognitive-affective structure or schema - a pattern of thinking and feeling that gives meaning to the past, defines the present, and provides direction for the future. It serves the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing experience for the individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those same functions for a society. </p>

<p>A mythic crisis occurs when a prevailing myth becomes so outdated or otherwise dysfunctional that the psyche generates a counter-myth to organize perceptions and responses which the old myth cannot accommodate. We are most likely to become aware of a given myth when a change is occurring within it. Because dreams appear to synthesize one's existing mythic structures with the data of one's life experiences, any incongruity between these elements is often presented to us in dream content. Indeed, it appears to be the task of many dreams to resolve any disjuncture between our personal mythology and our actual experience. </p>

<p>Because it is the nature of many dreams to expose and puncture dysfunctional personal myths and to shed light on the self-deceptive strategies we use to avoid initiating a more functional pattern of beha vior, dream appreciation can be one of the most effective means of bringing these myths into conscious awareness.</p>

<p>A particular dream may include one or more of the following aspects: The dream may attempt to strengthen an old, self-limiting myth (particularly when it is challenged), by: </p>

<ol type="a">

<li>emphasizing past experiences which formerly provided evidence for the validity of the old myth;</li> 

<li>resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth;</li>  

<li>providing glimpses of a future dominated by the old myth-a preview of the future according to the old myth, often with a sense of inevitability.

</li> 

</ol>

<p>Dreams may create or strengthen a counter-myth which has grown out of the old myth's deficiencies by:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>reworking old experiences and interpreting them in a less self-limiting, more affirming manner, providing an alternative to the old myth's template of reality;</li>

<li>by organizing possibilities into a positive future with wish-fulfillment qualities. While inspiration for pursuing these possibilities is often present, instruction for how to translate them into daily life is not generally evident.</li>

</ol>

<p>Or, the dream may facilitate a cognitive-effective integration between the two myths (the previously existing old myth and the new counter-myth). This process is suggested in dreams that:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>feature experiences from the past in which the mythic conflict was evident and show ways it could be integrated;</li> 

<li>highlight the conflict as it emerged in recent experience and show ways of resolving it; or</li>  

<li>portend a future where the conflict is resolved, often hinting at ways in which the dreamer might accomplish the resolution.</li>

</ol>

<p>Finally, feeling tone often gives an important clue as to the function of the dream. Old myth dreams typically feel defeating, hopeless, and draining. Counter-myth dreams typically have a hopeful, optimistic, even exhilarating tone. And integration dreams generally feel calm, positive and realistic. </p>

<p>Now let's take a look at how we might apply some of these concepts to an actual dream report. We're going to assume that the vast majority of our readers are familiar with the Beatles (in fact, we're going to assume that you have a copy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8">"A Day in the Life"</a> that you can now listen to). As you're listening to the song, notice that you are being led through a dreamscape. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I read the news today oh boy, About a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad, Well I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good place to begin is with the feeling tone of the dream (especially in this case, as the music provides us with a very tangible expression of the emotional context). What is the overall emotional sense we get from this dream? The voice is distant; it is detached from the scene being described, which is a tragic car accident. Notice the disconnect between the sadness of the news and the dreamer's reaction "well I just had to laugh... " </p>

<p>Leonard Bernstein once reportedly told an interviewer that this song was the most brilliant five minutes of music written since World War II. Indeed, what other piece of music so perfectly captures the strange, self-contained logic of a dream in which even the most unlikely juxtapositions appear to make perfect sense? The next scene is similar to the car accident in that it is a scene of tragedy. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I saw a film today, oh boy. The English army had just won the war."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen to Lennon's intonation of 'oh boy.' The weary boredom in his voice is far removed from the enthusiasm this phrase brings to mind! This stanza seems to be referring to the famous films of the concentration camps made at the end of World War II, truly some of the most horrific film of the century. It isn't surprising that, 'A crowd of people turned away.' For them, it was too terrible to watch. But our anesthetized dreamer doesn't turn away... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"But I just had to look, Having read the book."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here again we have the perfect statement of the dreamer's distance from all that he is witnessing. As in the first scene, his reaction is somehow justified by having experienced an artificial depiction of the event. In the first sequence, he 'just had to laugh' because he'd seen the photograph. In this case, he 'just had to look' because he'd read the book. </p>

<p>At this point, the song takes us into a swirling orchestral tumult which ends with the ringing of an alarm clock. Then, "Woke up, fell out of bed, Dragged a comb across my head..." The music has changed completely (as has the voice, from Lennon's to McCartney's). What had been remote and unconcerned is now matter-of-fact and busy. For the rest of this stanza, we are led through the morning ritual: the tea, being late, grabbing the coat and hat, almost missing the bus, having a first cigarette... But then somebody speaks, our guide drifts off into another dream and we are once again in the parallel-world where traffic fatalities can be funny, and war can be nothing more than a curiosity. </p>

<p>What can we conclude about the import of this dream? In terms of the feeling tone, it seems that this is an old myth dream. Both music and voice are voi d of emotion. There is a sense of dissociation from everything being experienced. Even expressions that are used specifically to convey emotion-"oh boy"-are delivered utterly empty. </p>

<p>Nothing that we see in the content of the dream suggests that a counter-myth is being offered or strengthened, nor does there seem to be a process of integration taking place. Rather, it seems that our guide is dreaming of daily experiences (the traffic accident involving a member of the House of Lords, corning across a documentary about World War II being shown in a public place) that could easily lead to a challenge to his current personal mythology. But he is apparently not yet ready to generate a counter-myth to replace his old, entrenched myth. This dream seems to be performing the second function of the old myth type: 'resolving conflicts between the old myth and daily experiences through the assimilation of these experiences into the structure of the old myth.' </p>

<p>And yet, it seems our dreamer is on the cusp of a true crisis in his personal mythology. This crisis is suggested in the vast distance his dream suggests he feels between himself and his experience, as well as by the fact that the assimilation of these experiences seems provisional, at best. It is certainly a forced assimilation when tragedy has become funny, and evidence of extreme human cruelty evokes nothing beyond mild interest. The dream is so inappropriately devoid of emotion, so empty and lonely, that one cannot help but feel that it is a call for help of some kind. Such numbness can only be the result of extreme pain, and the extremity of this pain may presage a breakthrough into a counter-myth scenario, perhaps in another dream. </p>

<p>We hope that this example has been helpful in clarifying a few of the concepts and techniques one can use in dream appreciation. We would welcome other opinions and interpretations concerning this dream report, as well as suggestions of other dream-containing songs that might be used in future articles (please send them to <a href="../@chrisryan">Chris Ryan</a>).</p>

  <p>…Today the one thing we will not tolerate is history.

  <p>-James Hillman</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The year is 410, and the Christian-Germanic army of Alaric the Visigoth marches relentlessly on Rome.</em></p>

<p><em>Furious at being passed over for promotion into the Roman legions, Alaric has seized the opportunity presented by the execution of Stilicho, Rome’s greatest general, whom the Emperor has foolishly mistaken for a traitor. Tucked safely away at Ravenna, his foresight—as narrow as Aurelius’s had been wide. Honorius does not yet comprehend that the 900-year-old Western Empire is about to fall forever.</em></p>

<p>What you have just read usually goes by the name of history, that which has already occurred. This is the history known to books and scholarship, the history of events that occupy intervals of linear time. A narrative of the real. </p>

<p>But the psyche lives in a different kind of reality. Situated between the hardness of events and the softness of spirit, the imaginal world of the unconscious unfolds according to circular narratives spun by mythic meanings. In its inexhaustible springs, distinctions of time and space become fictionalized. What holds sway there instead are non-linear laws of metaphor and image, not of might or matter. </p>

<p>Because of this slippery time/space relativity, the unconscious psyche anticipates. In many media, including the privately arranged screenings known as dreams, it loans us snapshots of roads not yet taken, possible futures. It tells us, not where we will go, but where we might go if we won’t change course. </p>

<p>That so many of today’s science fiction books and films paint pictures of an oncoming apocalypse should not only give us pause, but prompt us to wonder: what is psyche trying to tell us? Might we interpret these broadcast daylight images as we would those carried to us in our sleep? </p>

<h2>The History Of Things To Come</h2>

<p>If films—like myths and folktales—are a culture’s way of dreaming, let us interpret a particular dream series. </p>

<p>Although speculative films about the bomb go back to the Manhattan Project days, the 70s, 80s, and 90s saw the images shifting strangely forward from imminent nuclear annihilation to survival in a world already sickened by nuclear hell loosed on earth. Science fiction examples of this include The Omega Man, The Planet Of The Apes, Mad Max, Blade Runner, and, more recently, The Terminator, Waterworld, The Postman, Star Trek: First Contact, and The Day After Tomorrow. How can we explain this? </p>

<p>Were this dreamed at night, we would track the progression in terms of an unconscious development underway: from the risk of something destroyed to its destruction to the aftermath. We would see it as an imaginal death in progress, the termination of some significant inward structure: an aspect of self, an important relationship, an outmoded style of being. If the film—like the novel as Sartre understood it—takes as its subject the world, the apocalyptic progression suggests that the deep psyche has found it more meaningful to assume that the catastrophe it had been warning us about had already overtaken us.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means that an existence of post-atomic survivorhood—while not inevitable—is now so likely that the collective unconscious has moved its field of interest from symbolic warnings to imaginal speculations about what we will make of what remains. And whether we realize it or not, you and I are its ragtag survivors in futures fictionally ‘dreamed’ if not yet in literal fact. </p>

<p>This capacity for looking “back” (time/space relativity!) on possibilities unlikely to be avoided could be seen as the psyche’s forehistorical, precognitive capacity. “Fore” not as fortune or foreknowledge, but as foreboding and foreshadowing. They imagine rather than predict, for the future is not set. Some shadows precede rather than follow what casts them. </p>

<p>In Isaac Asimov’s Foundation novels, a visionary named Hari Seldon founds the science of psychohistory (now an actual field), a branch of mathematics that calculates the movements—not of individuals, who have a measure of free will and therefore unpredictability—but of large groups. “Raven” Seldon becomes unpopular when his calculations show that the Galactic Empire is falling. Hauled before a secret court, Seldon is asked how an ancient Empire so powerful and prosperous could possibly be in danger of dissolution. </p>

<p>Seldon cites several factors: a ponderous bureaucracy, a freezing of caste (read: politico-hierarchical appointment system), a lack of creative initiative, etc. What chills me is the following observation—penned by an author who had studied history and whose science fiction ultimately carried forth images from archetypal sources, as all works of the imagination do— </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…the rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might it ever had. The stormblast whistles through the branches of the Empire even now. Listen with the ears of psychohistory and you will hear the creaking.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are we to think about our well-armored and portable legions, our electronicized Coliseum, our Americanized and worldwide military outposts, our Roman-style aqueducts, our Imperial Eagle, our bureaucratic extravagances, our rampaging teens who describe exciting events as “the bomb” and refer to themselves as Goths?</p>

<p>Listen to this with ears sensitized to the voices from the depths and you will hear forehistory, the logical and predictable Santayanic result of historical (and psychological) lessons unlearned; and you will hear it in the making, not down the road, but in the present. Today, in tightening borders, vastly expanded surveillance, a global warming of the spirit as well as the Earth, the ascendancy of theocracy masked as democracy, the renewed push for “tactical” nuclear weapons, and a solidifying alliance of terrified nation-states banding together (the Eastern Coalition of Star Trek: First Contact) to stand up to superpower giantism. </p>

<p>Where else do we hear the thundering below this precipice? In the streets? In the halls of power? In secret bioweapon labs? In slumbering warheads? </p>

<p><em>In you and me.</em> </p>

<h2>The Mares Of Night</h2>

<p>Although looking at what brought us to this brink of mutual self-destruction would take us beyond this paper (see my forthcoming book Terrapsychology for a more detailed discussion), we might sum things up in the shape of an axiom: </p>

<p><em>When the members of a culture that makes no room for the world of dream live in a state of partial slumber, their most unconscious leaders inflict on the world an endless series of nightmares.</em> </p>

<p>Psychically speaking, these serve to take down our Promethean/Faustian/Frankensteinian idealism a peg or two. Spurning the psyche and its unknown deities amounts to hubris. The true matrix of myth and meaning, the depths of what we like to call the unconscious have addressed us since before the written word. Why else the need for ritual, religion, folklore? Everywhere and always human beings have paid creative, pious, and imaginal heed to powers behind and beyond the limited ego... except today, when the "enlightened" ego takes credit for everything, with all things bent to the measure of man. Jung had a good word for this state of mind: inflation. </p>

<p>I will not soon forget a dream I had after a restless evening of cursing dreams for communicating in incomprehensible symbols: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I waded in a pool toward an Asian man who addressed me in French, a language I don't speak. When I shook my head in confusion, he chided me for being a typical American who expected the world to speak English. "But when you visit our country," he added, "you must speak OUR language," at which point he turned into a large tortoise, handed me a piece of paper, and closed his shell. I examined the paper. </p>
  
  <p><strong>It was the Declaration of Independence.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a powerful reminder of the autonomy of the depths. </p>

<p>Think about the recent craze over the remaking of a film about the Titanic. Could there be a clearer example of hubris than a ship with that particular name sinking on its brazen maiden voyage? </p>

<p>In his paper “Re-Sink the Titanic,” psychologist Glen Slater writes: “As architects of hubris—unmitigated pride and sacrilege—the Titans—a race of giants—fought and were defeated by the Olympian gods, then banished to the underworld… .” It is ironic that the Titanic's sister ship was named the Olympic, and, in spite of an almost identical build, sailed steadily past her sibling’s fate without infamy. When these ships were named, someone failed to take their mythology seriously… </p>

<p>We are gripped by such tales because they are trying to warn us about the unconscious titanism made possible by the automaton satisfaction of being plugged into the mass mind. Disregarding the warning to unplug long enough to undertake a “psychological salvage,” we remain obsessed as though with an open wound. “It is we who have not yet completed this voyage.” (Glen Slater) </p>

<p>For six thousand years we have permitted exactly the wrong kind of people to have and hold power—namely, insecure boys pretending to be men—while being quiet accomplices to their brutally narcissistic and titanic imperialism. If the consequences are almost upon us, they force us to realize at last our kinship with the peoples and landscapes we have subjugated. In the end, everyone is crew, and there will never be enough lifeboats. </p>

<p>What, then, can be done? From a standpoint equipped with night vision, with dream vision (dreams are not about matters political: they are matters political), so much of what passes for reform or activism is actually reactivism: a shutting of the historical barn door after the mares of night have announced their intention to come home. “Consciousness-raising?” This very term is Promethean, a symptom of the verticality worship that brought us to this brink.</p>

<p>Perhaps instead we should take these forehistorical warnings at their word. </p>

<h2>Out of the Ashes</h2>

<p>Live as though the time had arrived”, Nietzsche advised. If from the deep psyche’s standpoint we are already, in some sense, survivors of the war, how should we act? Perhaps with what could be called a ‘post-apocalyptic aliveness’, the willingness to squeeze from each moment every last drop of its precious essence. </p>

<p>As in the war-ravaged deserts depicted in our films, survivors exercise many choices. Some do nothing and are passive victims of circumstance. Some spread the devastation, inwardly and outwardly, or hide away in denial like cowardly Honorius. Others create oases of decency and compassion, magic and foresight, wondrous adventure and love. We should have learned from patients who have survived terminal diagnosis by doctors that it’s never too late for soulmaking. </p>

<p>Or for a de-titanized humility informed by the graphics of destruction. It would never occur to a consciousness humbled by contact with its archetypal ground of being to play with bombs, lie to a constituency, monopolize resources, damage its environment, oppress an entire gender, marginalize minorities, turn teachings into dogmas, take guidelines for legalisms, or allow its brothers and sisters to go hungry. Because such lapses of responsibility are less a matter of pathology than of immaturity. We are better served here by reflecting on initiation into responsible psychological adulthood, a taking of the caring self out into the world, rather than through vertical models of inward evolution. “It’s time, past time,”—Six Nations chief Oren Lyons strongly advised in a lecture he gave in Santa Barbara recently—“for us to quit playing around and grow up.” </p>

<p>Many people believe that Zeus chained Prometheus for bringing fire to humanity. But the real offence was in doing so without making a pious sacrifice to the gods. Like any egotistical inventor unaware of the powers he invokes, Prometheus faked the sacrifice —failed to give the daimones their due—and was punished for it by himself becoming the sacrifice. He learned from his predicament, however, and was released when he agreed to serve the rightful gods. “Only sacrifice to the deep"--Slater speaking--"keeps the culture afloat.” </p>

<p>If the cinematic arts truly reflect roads not yet taken, then we are faced—not only with “the desert of the real”, the fall of our Western Empire and the sinking societal ship whose apparent seaworthiness tempts fate and Poseidon—but also with images of regeneration that recollect those alchemical theories in which the blackening of decay comprised only the first phase in the distillation of the redemptive Elixir of Life. </p>

<p>Most of Kevin Costner’s long film, <em>The Postman</em>, unfolds in townships devastated by a Third World War, townships visited by a raggy, hungry man carrying a bag of mail. He is, he believes, pretending to be a postman on a mission from “the Restored United States”. But dreams have ways of willing themselves into being, and his is no different. The result is an awakening of culture and freedom connected by a widening band of idealistic young mail carriers. When at last he restores a lasting peace and returns to Bridge City, his mate gives him the child born in his absence, telling him, “Her name is Hope”. So the daughter of adversity is Hope... very fitting in that the feminine has remained so long at the top of the Promethean patriarchy’s hit list. Fitting, also, in that what we exile turns out to be the banished verdancy for which we thirst in our arid after-disaster exile. </p>

<p>Hope, the last occupant of Pandora’s famous box. But only if we keep on dreaming. </p>

<p>In the Star Trek universe, the Third World War destroyed most of the major cities, leaving bands of refugees flung across a world ruined almost beyond repair. It’s significant, by the way, that the first and the last Next Generation television episodes bring the “dangerous, childlike race” of humanity to final judgment in a virtual post-atomic courtroom of the kind that dispensed summary justice during the years after the conflagration that killed countless millions. </p>

<p>And yet the spacecraft whose maiden voyage—so unlike the Titanic’s—did so much to unify what remained of humanity was built, ironically, from the remains of a nuclear missile! Her name too is mythic, this dream with wings, the first ship to take us from the roaring fires of destruction to the silent fires of the stars: <strong><em>Phoenix.</em></strong> ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>"The Stuff dreams are Made of" by Sharon Bagley, and "Dreams on the Couch", by David Gelman: Newsweek, 8-14-1989 pg.40-46</em></p>

<p>One afternoon last summer, as I waited in the checkout line of a local market, holding a deli sandwich and gazing aimlessly at the magazines, I suddenly saw something that amazed me: there, in big letters, was a cover proclaiming "Dreams - New Lessons From the Theater of the Mind". And then I did a big double-take, for this was not the cover of <em>The National Enquirer</em>, but of <em>Newsweek</em>, one of the country's most respected and widely-circulated news magazines! </p>

<p>I grabbed a copy instantly and practically ran out to the park to read it. Forgetting my sandwich entirely, I opened up the magazine to see if it was really true: could they have written a cover story all about dreams? Sure enough, there at the top of the table of contents was the bold caption "Unlocking the Mysteries of Dreams" and a description of the articles. I laughed aloud... the dreamwork movement has really hit the big-time! Here are articles that millions of people will read, put together by a highly professional publication and given the tremendous status of a cover story.</p>

<p>Along with a wave of excitement, however, I felt an undertow of concern as well. "New Lessons from the Theater of the Mind"... I've always been hesitant to compare dreams to theater because in a culture like ours, which dismisses art as a pleasant but insignificant escape from "real" life, such a comparison can carry unwanted meanings<sup>1</sup>. "Unlocking the Mysteries of Dreams"... the use of key and lock imagery to describe dreamwork also disturbs me; it suggests an intrusive, aggressively masculine approach.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>As I continued to read the table of contents blurb, the worry wrinkles on my forehead grew deeper and deeper. The little paragraph began, "The act of dreaming is so basic a part of man's evolutionary heritage that it can be traced back 135 million years"... given that so many women are involved in dreamwork, this sexist language can only indicate a distorted and incomplete vision of the dreamwork movement as a whole. "But now modern science is finally deciphering... and harnessing... this nocturnal theater of the mind. Even executives are asking their dreams to solve their problems"... more language of domination and exploitation, calling up the image of yoking a beast of burden. And then, oh no, the idea that dreams are profitable! </p>

<p>I found that <em>Newsweek</em> had broken the story into two articles, the first focusing primarily on the work of sleep laboratory researchers and the second discussing the current status of dreams in psychoanalytic practice. By now my initial excitement had long been replaced by a mounting sense of disaster. Such a division of the story on dreams into two articles reinforces two of the worst public misconceptions about dreams: first, that sleep laboratory research and psychoanalytic therapy are the two important fields of dream study; and, second, that these two are best discussed separately, as independent approaches to dreams. </p>

<p>Before reading any further, I decided to put the magazine down for a moment. Eat my sandwich, try to relax a bit. OK, I said to myself, the articles aren't going to be perfect. I shouldn't expect them to be flawless or absolutely comprehensive. I'll just read them to see what the mainstream media finds most interesting about dreams. What do they want to know? What aspects of dreaming do the media highlight, and what aspects do they obscure, dismiss, or ignore? With my turkey and swiss safely entrusted to my digestive system, I began reading the first article, entitled "The Stuff That Dreams are Made of". The basic theme of this article is that dreams, once the province of "pop culture", have now become the object of legitimate scientific study. About half-way down the first page, the article comments "In the 1970s [dream] devotees launched newsletters and clubs whose members swapped dreams over herbal tea; they snapped up books that promised to reveal meanings as easily as looking up 'tunnel' in the index". (p.41) But, the article goes on, "what was a fad is now mainstream"; now serious, clearthinking people too have apparently decided that exploring dreams may have some value. </p>

<p>My resolve to stay calm just about evaporated right here; this slur against the grassroots dreamwork community almost made me toss the magazine out with my sandwich wrapper. In one sentence the author manages to imply that dream-sharing is merely the table chit chat of the natural foods set; that popular books on dreams are nothing more than deceitful, simplistic symbol dictionaries; and that the people who buy such books are gullible fools desiring instant dream interpretation gratification. </p>

<p>And then, what does the author offer as evidence that the exploration of dreams has gone "mainstream"? The fact that students in a "creative management" course at the Stanford Business School discuss dreams in order to solve business problems. Oh, I see: it's "progress" when fuzzy-headed New Agers are no longer the only ones talking about dreams because they have been joined by profit-seeking capitalists who use dreams as a new tool for beating the competition.</p>

<p>Should I go on with this? I eyed the distance between my bench and the nearest metal trash can. Twelve, maybe fifteen feet. I bet if I crumpled the magazine into the sandwich wrapper and put a good back spin on my shot... No, I said to myself, don't do that. Just breathe deeply for a couple of minutes, try to regain some degree of equanimity. Maybe the best way to get through these articles would be to think of them as indicating challenges for the dreamwork community. According to this article, dreamwork goes along with various other strange, counter-cultural activities; so, our challenge is to show how dreamwork is a valuable activity regardless of one's politics or taste for tofu. Likewise, the article suggests that popular books on dreams are simplistic how-to manuals for the psyche; well, we must promote those books that address a general audience and yet that offer a more sophisticated approach to understanding dreams<sup>3</sup>. It seems that many people first look to dreams in the hope of gaining as a reward something tangible; we need to nurture this hope and show people that a "tangible" gain is not always a financial profit. </p>

<p>Once past this terrible introduction, I found that the first <em>Newsweek</em> article does provide a pretty good summary of current scientific research on dreams. The work of J. Allan Hobson, Milton Kramer, Rosalind Cartwright, David Foulkes, Ernest Hartmann, Robert Smith, and Stephen LaBerge all receive accurate and complimentary descriptions. I was pleased to see that the article devotes a total of five or six paragraphs to Gayle Delaney and her approach to personal dream interpretation. Once again, she displays her great ability at communicating to a broad audience some of the most basic ideas of dream interpretation. While Delaney's method may not be especially innovative, she is the most effective spokesperson for the dreamwork community and deserves credit for that. </p>

<p>I had stopped fantasizing about slam dunking the <em>Newsweek</em> into the trash can; this first article hadn't turned out to be so bad. The author concludes that all the progress in scientific knowledge about dreams does not imply that dreams are merely the random firings of neurons without any meaning whatsoever; in other words, the study of brain physiology and the interpretation of meaning are compatible. Hallelujah! If the article has no other effect on the public attitude toward dreams, we can hope that it will be this: that "science" is no longer determined to denounce the meaningfulness of dreams. </p>

<p>The second article, "Dreams on the Couch", faced a more difficult task than the first. While it's a fairly straightforward matter to string together the greatest hits of sleep laboratory research (as the first article does), it's much harder to describe clearly in a short space the process of <em>interpreting</em> dreams. The author of this second article chose to discuss the ideas of two psychoanalysts whose approaches to interpreting the dreams of their patients diverge from orthodox Freudian theory. Both of these analysts reject Freud's insistence that the true meaning of a dream is disguised wish intentionally hidden from consciousness. Harry Fiss describes how the meaning of a dream is not hidden, but is rather expressed in the special metaphorical language of the unconscious. The other analyst, Edward Brennan, believes that it's not the wish that is important so much as how the dreamer behaves in the dream, i.e. the "defenses" he or she uses. Thus when a woman patient reported a nightmare to him, Brennan focused less on who is chasing her then on how specifically she struggles against her attacker. </p>

<p>This second article ends with an expression of respect for the often indescribable beauty of dreams, for their poetic, uncanny, fascinating powers. Again, I could only be pleased with such a conclusion, for it makes clear that dream interpretation is not a matter of <em>reducing</em> the dream contents into this or that hidden meaning. Whereas the first article contributes to a new public understanding that scientists no longer believe dreams are "nothing but" random brain activity, the second article makes it clear that psychoanalysts no longer believe dreams are "nothing but" disguised sexual or aggressive wishes. </p>

<p>I finished reading the two articles and decided to stretch my lunch break a bit longer by walking over to the lake. As I strolled I began to think about what the articles <em>left out</em>. What <em>didn't</em> get reported? Who <em>wasn't</em> interviewed? The more I thought about this, the more I realized how limited the public understanding of dreams and dreamwork still is. </p>

<p>To begin with, the only people to whom the authors spoke were professional academics or psychologists-and all of them from the U.S. There was no discussion of the vast numbers of people working with dreams in various community contexts. There were no interviews with the many talented and knowledgable dreamworkers who aren't affiliated with a university and who aren't doctors. There was no comment on the incredible discoveries made by recent anthropological studies of dreams in other cultures.<sup>4</sup> There was no reflection on the exploration of dreams as a spiritual process, or as a source of artistic creativity. There was no consideration of dreamwork as a social movement, beyond the dismissive "fad" comment early on. </p>

<p>In short, the two articles failed to report on vast areas of the study and exploration of dreams. True, we must thank <em>Newsweek</em> for making a big contribution to the general public interest in dreams, first simply by putting the story on its cover and second by accurately describing important changes in the attitudes of scientific researchers and of psychoanalysts. But still, I feel there's much to disappoint us in these articles. They support the common assumptions that only scientists and psychoanalysts have anything important to say about the field, and they ignore the many exciting developments that have emerged out of other approaches to dreams.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Nevertheless, this comparison of dreams to a theater is one of the most popular among modern dreamworkers. It can be found in the works of Carl Jung, Calvin Hall, and Gayle Delaney, among many others. If, however, we could raise the status of art as an important, meaningful realm of experience that is intimately related to the" real" world, the comparison of dreams with theater (or with poetry, or film, or dance, etc.) could become an adequate, indeed a powerful metaphor. </p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Consider, for example, Freud's comment regarding his bullying treatment of Dora, a young female patient, that "the case has opened smoothly to my collection of picklocks" (Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria (New York: Collier Books, 1963), p.7. - and then his later comment that "is not 'jewelcase' a term commonly used to describe female genitals that are immaculate and intact?" (p. 111) </p>

<p><sup>3</sup> I would include among this group of books Dream Work, by <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a>; Let Your Body Interpret Your Dreams, by Eugene Gendlin; Working with Dreams by <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>; and Living Your Dreams by Gayle Delaney. These are my favorites, anyway. </p>

<p><sup>4</sup> For example, the research gathered by Barbara Tedlock in her book <em>Dreaming - Anthropological and Psychological Interpretations</em> (Cambridge, Eng. Cambridge U Press. 1987).</p>

    ns1:description """<p>In his 1989 book entitled <em>Multiple Personality Disorder</em>, Dr. Ross said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The exclusion of extrasensory perception (ESP) from serious mainstream psychiatry is an artifact of our cultural history. There are only two possibilities concerning ESP experiences: Either they are real or they are illusory. If ESP is real, excluding it from psychiatry and mainstream science is prejudice masquerading as science. If ESP is not real, there is no more reason to exclude it from phenomenological study than any other set of delusions..." (p. 183) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a 1992 paper, Drs. Ross and Joshi say: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Paranormal experiences are so common in the general population that no theory of normal psychology or psychopathology which does not take them into account can be comprehensive." (p. 360) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have borrowed these two quotes from a 1992 paper by Dr. Hufford who continues by saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I would go further. I would say that conventional psychiatric theory does take them into account, but in a way that is at odds with the empirical data. This does not simply prevent theories from being comprehensive, it makes them likely to be wrong in very important ways."(p.362) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Hufford points out that there have been numerous surveys made and they all show that paranormal experiences are far more common than many scientists seem to want to believe. Moreover, they all unanimously say that déjà vu is encountered more often than any of the other paranormal experiences that have been studied. In fact, if the results of a Gallup poll made in June, 1990 of 1236 American adults can be believed, 55% of those questioned say they believe in déjà vu and 56% readily admit to have "had the feeling of déjà vu". (Gallup &amp; Newport, 1991)</p>

<p>I find it interesting that when inquiring about déjà vu, Gallup and Newport asked people if they had "been somewhere or done something before" (presumably while at the same time knowing that they had not). There seems to be some confusion about what constitutes a déjà vu experience: For some it has to do with living through an experience for seemingly a second time, while for others it is evoked in strange locations and places, where the "afflicted" are convinced they know their way around while at the same time knowing that this should not be possible. This is most succinctly stated in the Rogers and Hart song title "Where or When" (the lead song in their 1937 play "Babes in Arms"), or as an article in the May 5, 1997 issue of TIME magazine put it, "Been There, Done That"! (p. 46) </p>

<p>I am convinced that two different experiences are being referred to here, and they may very well have very different origins and etiologies. Neppe, in his 1983 book <em>The Psychology of Déjà Vu</em> listed 20 different déjà experiences (!). Rather than lumping them together and calling all such occurrences "déjà vu", it might be well to speak in general of déjà experiences, while the two I mentioned above could be referred to as déjà vécu (already experienced) and déjà visité (already visited). The former is situational, while the latter has to do with uncanny geographic knowledge (Funkhouser, 1995). This does not rule out the possibility that combined forms occur in which both aspects are present. </p>

<p>A poll comparable to the one mentioned above was made by Dr. Levin in 1988 with 1456 respondents with the result that 67.3% of those questioned said that they had had one or more déjà vu experiences (Levin, 1993). There, déjà vu is defined simply as "Thought you were somewhere you had been before" (which I would call déjà visité). He goes on to quote Greeley, who found an incidence of 59% in the general population and wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whether ‘deja vu’ can be termed ‘paranormal’ or not is a matter for debate.... I assume there are ‘natural’ explanations for these phenomena. However, I do not assume that such explanations explain them away." (Greeley, 1975, pp. 7-8) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Altogether I have seen 20 surveys and the incidences found for déjà experience range from 30% to 83%, depending on which population was questioned and very likely on how it is defined. This indicated that we are dealing with a very common experience which justifies serious consideration and study. </p>

<h2>Dream Theories of Déjà Experience by Literary Authors</h2>

<p>The earliest mention of a dejalike experience that I know of already mentions a connection with dreams. It is a quote taken from On the Trinity, chapter XV of book XII, by St. Augustine (354 - 430 AD) where he said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"For we should not credit the story of those who say that Pythagorus of Samos recalled some such things that he had experienced when he had already been here in another body, and of others who relate that there were yet some others who experienced something of the kind in their minds. That these were false recollections, such as we commonly experience during sleep, when we seem to remember as though we have done or seen something which we have not done or seen at all, and that the minds of those even who are awake were affected in this way by the suggestions of the evil and deceptive spirits, whose care it is to deceive men by confirming or sowing this erroneous opinion about the revolutions of souls."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Revolutions of souls" was St. Augustine’s way of saying "reincarnation," and he was worried about it being used to explain occurrences of déjà experience. </p>

<p>To my knowledge there was nothing more written about déjà experience, nor concerning any other theory about how it might arise, until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott published a book called <em>Guy Mannering</em>, or <em>The Astrologer</em>. There the protagonist was kidnapped by pirates from his home on the coast of Scotland when only a young boy. He was forced to become part of the crew and subsequently sailed all over the world, including India. Many years later, he happened to return to his birthplace but with no memory of it. As one might imagine, what he saw there evoked a strong sense of familiarity and that caused him to muse: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Why is it that some scenes awaken thoughts which belong as it were to dreams of early and shadowy recollection, such as my old Brahman would have ascribed to a state of previous existence? Is it the visions of our sleep that float confusedly in our memory, and are recalled by the appearance of such real objects as in any respect correspond to the phantoms which they presented to our imagination? How often do we find ourselves in society which we have never before met, and yet feel impressed with a mysterious and ill-defined consciousness, that neither the scene, the speakers, nor the subject, are entirely new; nay feel as if we could anticipate that part of the conversation which has not yet taken place!" (p. 294) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this short passage, Scott manages to imply and mention three theories about how déjà experience can arise. Dreams (please note: with images that are similar to that which subsequently occurs) together with reincarnation are both spoken about, while the actual explanation is that Guy Mannering had really been in that place once before and his sense of recognition is due to real memories.</p>

<p>Since reincarnation has been mentioned in both of these texts, I would like to quote something that Ernst von Feuchtersleben, a prominent Viennese psychiatrist (Laor, 1982) wrote in his 1895 psychiatric textbook: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"…one, for example, has the feeling as if a situation in which one finds himself was present once before as it is now, which some have assumed out of poetic error to be a sign of previous existence (Platonic reminiscence). If at all, it is unlikely that we sat together dressed in lace clothes [and] kid gloves in salons at tea and buns." (My translation) (Feuchtersleben, 1895). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incidentally, should anyone be interested, he classified déjà experiences as fantasies of memory. </p>

<p>Before turning to scientific authors, I would like to include a quotation taken from a little essay entitled "Speculations on Metaphysics" that Mary Shelley, Percy Byssche Shelley’s wife (a famous author in her own right), edited from notes he had written and she published after his untimely death. At the very end, he told of a déjà experience he had had while out walking with a friend near Oxford. He said they suddenly turned a corner of a lane and he described what he saw there. He went on to say: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The effect which it produced on me was not such as could have been expected. I suddenly remembered to have seen that exact scene in some dream of long… Here I was obliged to leave off, overcome by thrilling horror." (p. 297) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a footnote, Mary Shelley noted that she remembered his coming to her after writing this, "pale and agitated, to seek refuge in conversation from the fearful emotions it excited." This is the first account that I know of in which someone described in print an actual déjà experience that he had had (Funkhouser, 1996). Other literary authors of that period who concerned themselves with déjà vu include Rossetti, Tennyson, Dickens, Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Oliver Wendall Holmes. </p>

<h2>Precognitive Dreams</h2>

<p>A bit further on I hope to present further evidence, based on accounts of people who have had them, that at least some déjà occurrences can be explained by preceding precognitive dreams. Dreams and visions that presage the future have fascinated mankind for countless ages, and dream interpreters were long in great demand in many cultures around the world, mainly for that reason (Van de Castle, 1994, pp. 45-66). </p>

<p>One does not have to be content with prophecies and visions from the Bible or ancient Egyptian papyri in this regard, though. There is now an enormous body of evidence which has been assembled over the years seeking to demonstrate the existence of precognition and precognitive dreams. I have in my collection over 110 articles and papers dealing with these two topics, and more are being published every day. Excellent reviews can be found in a chapter Robert Van de Castle contributed to <em>Handbook of Parapsychology</em> (1977) as well as a chapter in his 1994 book, <em>Our Dreaming Mind</em> (pp. 407-9). Another good review is found in a chapter by Martin Ebon on <em>Parapsychological Dream Studies</em> for a book called <em>The Dream and Human Societies</em> (1966). In this connection three other books should also be mentioned, namely An Experiment in Time (Dunne, 1927), Man and Time (Priestley, 1968) and Dreams That Come True (Ryback &amp; Sweitzer, 1988). </p>

<p>In An Experiment in Time, Dunne, an aeronautical engineer and designer of planes flown for England in the First World War, told of his precognitive dreams. He became convinced that everyone had just as many images from the future in their dreams as they do residues from the past and he set out to prove it with investigations he did with students at Oxford University. His idea was that if you examine your dreams closely, you will discover elements that only make sense if you keep your eyes open on the days following the dream. </p>

<p>In a 1988 paper, Nancy Sondow found that 10% of her dreams contained such precognitive elements and that the amount of time that elapsed between her dreams and their "coming true" was quite short. She discovered that most of such future-determined elements in her dreams came from the day following the dream, while a lot fewer were from days later on. (Sondow, 1988). </p>

<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof reported that persons under the influence of LSD experience precognitive visions or, in his words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Occasionally, LSD subjects report... anticipation of events that will happen in the future. Sometimes, they witness complex and detailed scenes of future happenings in the form of vivid clairvoyant visions and can even hear the acoustic concomitants that are part of them; the latter range from ordinary sounds of everyday life, musical sequences, single words, and entire sentences, to noise produced by motor vehicles and various alarming acoustic signals (the sound of fire engines, ambulance sirens, or blowing car horns). Some of these experiences manifest various degrees of similarity with actual events occurring at a later time." (Graf, 1976, pp. 177-8). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physicists have also made contributions concerning such "loops" in time and have posited theories as to how knowledge of the future and even time travel might be possible (Deutsch &amp; Lockwood, 1994). There are also now several registries where premonitions and precognitive dreams can be sent for archival purposes. There is such a registry in an institute for parapsychological research at the University of Freiburg am Breisgau in Germany. Robert Nelson, the director of the Central Premonitions Registry in Manhattan, reported that as of 1976 after seven years of existence, over 3000 persons from all over the US and even 23 foreign countries had sent in their (presumed) previsions, dreams and hunches and he provided an overview of what sorts of categories were "generated by the flow of predictions" (Nelson R, 1976, p. 22). I have learned that the International Association for Near Death Studies has also established such a registry where survivors of near-death experiences can send accounts of things they have seen which they think may presage a future happening. </p>

<p>Dr. Mary Louise von Franz, a prominent Jungian therapist in Zurich, once wrote that there were two types of precognitive dreams: ones which she referred to as telepathic and ones which were symbolic in character (von Franz, 1978). The first are true to life and to what is going to happen, while the latter require interpretation and some acquaintance with symbols. I would add that a dream may contain only elements from the future (à la Dunne and Sondow), or may contain an extended prevision of what is to come. Dr. von Franz also pointed out that while most dreams, including precognitive ones, arose from the personal unconscious, there are also dreams which come from deeper, more collective and archetypal levels. In her words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In our analytic work, when one has to deal with a dream containing only personal material, one can generally relate its meaning to the immediate present as a reaction to the things one did or experienced the day before or which one would meet the day after the dream [which agrees with what Nancy Sondow found]. If we have to deal with an archetypal dream motif, its meaning is valid for a much longer period of time, for months or even for many years. Archetypal dreams remembered from early childhood even often anticipate the fate of an individual for his whole life, or at least for his first half of life. (pp. 181-2). </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dream Theories of Déjà Experience by Scientific Authors</h2>

<p>Strictly speaking, there are actually three dream theories which have been put forward over the years in an attempt to explain déjà experiences. The one says that the person has dreamt of something similar and the mind makes an association to what has been seen in a dream to produce the uncanny recognition or heightened sense of familiarity, which is the hallmark of the déjà vu experience. One encounters this in the writings of six authors that I know of: Jessen (1855), Kraepelin (1887), Guyau (1890), Ellis (1897), Störrig (1900), and Dwelschauvers (1916). The last investigator suggested that there are probably several sources which generate déjà vu experiences and that dreams with similar elements may be just one of them. </p>

<p>In addition, I have found two authors who maintained that the association with dreams is just a trick of the memory: one thinks one has lived through this event or seen this place in a dream, but that is an illusion (Hodgson, 1865; Royce, 1889). This would represent, then, a second dream theory. </p>

<p>The third theory (and the one I favor) is that precognitive dreams which are not remembered until they "come true" give rise to many if not all déjà experiences (Funkhouser, 1983). Of scientific authors who are of the same mind, Paul Radestock (1879) was the earliest that I have found. Going through his dream diary, he wrote that he could identify antecedents to the déjà incidents he experienced. Other authors from that period who maintained the same thing include Buccola (1883), Sully (1884), Lapie (1894), Allin (1895), Bozzaro (1901), Méré (1903), Lemaître (1904), and Grasset (1904). Many even provide accounts of either their own experiences or those of others. </p>

<p>More modern authors who also have suggested that precognitive dreams provide the best explanation for déjà experience include MacCurdy (1925), Carrington (1931), Ferenczi (1951), Moufang &amp; Stevens (1953), and Chari (1962, 1964) who, as an Indian philosopher, wrote some excellent, deeply thought out papers concerning this phenomenon and especially concerning the supposed connection with reincarnation. </p>

<p>It is hard to believe that twenty five years have now passed since ASD member Rhea White published her review with the title "The Mystery of Deja Vu" (White, 1973). In her article she quoted from many of the sources I have just listed. She mentioned, for example, that Carrington put forward a theory that out-of-body experiences could be an explanation for what I have referred to as déjà visité. She also says that Dr. Louisa Rhine of Duke University felt that either that or precognitive dreams were the source of déjà experiences. Dr. White also said that "The most commonly offered parapsychic explanation for deja vu is the precognitive dream." (p. 46) </p>

<p>In case further proof is needed, I can mention the late German actress Christine Mylius who had numerous déjà experiences and could trace them to her dreams. She began sending her dreams to Prof. Bender in Freiburg and could tell him where to find the dreams that subsequently showed up in her film roles. She eventually published a book about her experiences, the English title of which would be <em>Dream Diary: Experiment with the Future</em>. (My translation) (Mylius, 1974). </p>

<p>In preparing this article, I queried the alt.dreams and alt.- dreams.lucid news groups on what is called the UseNet. By entering déjà vu as the key words, I turned up 48 people who, between May 13, 1996 and April 26, 1997, spontaneously wrote to either tell about the déjà vu experiences they had had and/or to offer explanations as to how such an experience can arise. Compiling the results, I found that 32 or 67% favored precognitive dreams as the most likely explanation for déjà vu, while the others were evenly split with either some other explanation (8) or had none to offer (8). A few reported having déjà experience in their dreams: they said they would recognize in the dream that they had dreamt it before or been in that place in another dream. I suppose this experience could be termed déjà rêve (Neppe, 1983, p. 10). </p>

<p>I have long pondered the question as to why the events foreseen in the precognitive dreams that later result in déjà experiences always seem to be so banal. I would think that if my unconscious goes to all the trouble it may require to give me a "preview of coming attractions," it would pick out events and maybe places that are in some way momentous or memorable. This has never proved to be the case, neither for me nor for most of the people with whom I have had the pleasure of discussing déjà experiences. It may be that dreams of important, emotionally charged events are more likely to be remembered upon waking, and are thus known as precognitive dreams; they don’t then result in déjà experiences where the antecedent is only remembered when it happens. Future research will have to show if this is true or not. </p>

<p>Even though the scene pre-seen is banal, the effects of having a déjà experience is often not. Like Shelley, some people are very upset. Others, though, seem to find déjà experiences reassuring: They feel that they are where they are supposed to be. I would have to say that déjà experiences are also important in that they show us that we have a lot to learn about this space-time universe we inhabit and about abilities which are not yet very developed in most people. If pressed, I would have to admit that my initial interest in dreams was prompted by my déjà experiences and they are thus of great value to me, banal as they might be. </p>

<p>I would like to conclude this brief survey by quoting from Rhea White’s article in which she went on to say: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It may be that we are dealing with a continuum of experience here, with vague fleeting feelings at one end and with vivid, detailed impressions at the other. Or it could be that the experiences, at base, are not cut off the same bolt, but that different predisposing factors result in different types of experiences of familiarity and recognition which tend to get lumped together under the term "deja vu" (p. 48).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robert Hoss, former scientist at IBM and mainstay of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) has compiled and published a very helpful book that brings together knowledge about dreams from an amazing array of sources. Mr. Hoss provides numerous tips about how an individual can work with his or her own dreams (especially any color that appears in them). It includes exercises at the end of most chapters. </p>

<p>I think it is ideally suited for courses in dreamwork at the high school or junior college level. I highly recommend this book.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>A variety of animals have appeared in my dreams. The deer has been my most frequent visitor. Even as a child, I felt a sense of peace when I encounter one of these creatures. The buck and doe have delivered me messages on receptivity, survival, adaptability, civilization, wilderness, wisdom and my adventurous path in life. </p>

<p>I was born into a family of five boys. At the time of my birth, the ages of my brothers were 19, 17, 10, 9 and 5. When I was 11, a brother died suddenly. Thirty years later, another brother died unexpectedly. After both of their deaths, I was flooded with dreams about Wayne and Danny. </p>

<p>A year ago, I completed writing my memoir. It is about mourning the death of a sibling from the perspective of a child and an adult. The end of the book has a series of thirty-six dreams that provided comfort during my bereavement. Dreams were vital in my healing process. They took me through difficult phases, offered help and prepared me for a hopeful future. It was hard to lose my two brothers but I have accepted them being gone. </p>

<p>From Wayne, I learned how to communicate and initiate. Danny taught me when to be quiet and observant. They both left me with the knowledge and ability to accept death. As time passed, my dreams with Danny and Wayne became further apart. This was part of the healing procedure. Recently, a new animal joined my dreams. It was a bear and here is the dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Inside, I could sense that my car was full of fuel when I drove down the road. I stopped driving the vehicle because there were road barriers. A huge female bear was curled up in a ball and slept on the road. She looked contented and smiled. Behind her were two small bear cubs. One was quiet and the other made playful bear sounds. They both lightheartedly swatted their paws at butterflies that flew in the air. Next to the cubs were five slender adult bears standing on their hind paws. They pushed machinery around with their front paws and performed road construction.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream caught my attention because I couldn’t move forward. The five bears represented my five brothers. They prepared the masculine energy in my home life before I was born. The cubs were a symbol of Wayne and Danny. Their souls have moved on to new life. The sleepy female bear represented the feminine energy that I had to use in order to balance out the tilted male energy within my family. Inside, I had the power to endure hardships through my dreams. </p>

<p>This bear dream reminded me to hibernate and use introspection about my sibling bonds. My family has taught me the importance of death, rebirth and transformation. Next to my deer, I have gladly accepted the bear as part of my dream totem pole.</p>

<h2>Bird Horn</h2>

<p><em>by Marie Otte</em></p>

<pre>

my bedroom adorns me in down

while finding myself near a town

walking over a bridge

sensing a voyage



I can see a hill

with people standing still

on top is a goose

her honk is letting loose



a mixture of French Horn

and bag pipes vibrating forlorn

the sound is loud

and pulling the crowd



the goose takes flight

as the people follow ever so light

the mystery of migration

above the birch in V-formation

</pre>

<h2>Camouflage Fox</h2>

<p><em>by Marie Otte</em></p>

<pre>

nodding off with a problem

reaching the bottom

he is trying to appear

while trotting near



large ears, sharp snout

stopping and standing about

I sense his piercing eyes

as he replies,



“Notice what is hidden.

Listen to your intuition.

Opportunities will manifest

in what is blessed.”

    ns1:description """<p>Precognitive dreams work in a variety of ways for dreamers. They have informed people about things that occurred the next day. Sometimes they have been a mystery with a silver lining that later unfolded and benefited the dreamer. This link between the dream and the event has taken days, months and even years to comprehend. </p>

<p>For two weeks, I had dreams about art galleries and museums. The walls were covered with framed paintings and photographed pictures of individual portraits. Small groups of people walked around and admired the art. These dreams didn’t seem to have a deep message or meaning for me. When I woke up in the morning, I felt a calmness from experiencing the nightly artistic tours. I belonged to a writers group that met on a monthly basis. We brought in a variety of individual manuscripts, read the material, and critiqued each other. A week after I had these dreams, the person in charge of the group gave us a writing idea to get the creative juices flowing. She suggested taking a favorite painting and writing a story prompted by the subject matter. This thought appealed to me so I went to the library and check out a huge anthology on famous paintings for inspiration. When I opened the book, I felt a dé jà vu about the dreams I had two weeks earlier. </p>

<p>After looking at hundreds of paintings, I felt drawn toward five of them. I had ideas for all of them but I couldn’t figure out which one to start writing a story about. One was Andy Warhol’s <em>Marilyn Diptych</em>. The diptych format comes from the Byzantine icons of Christian saints. </p>

<p>On a weekly basis I met with a another group of people. We would read a chapter in a book on spiritual development, discuss the contents, and then talk about our nightly dreams. While meeting with this group, I noticed that a small stack of books had been removed from an end table in the leader’s house. They had been there for several weeks and covered up a diptych of Mary and Jesus on the table that was now in plain sight. This caught my attention. The next week, I returned to the leader’s house for our meeting. Her teen-age daughter walked into the house, set her keys and purse on the table in front of the diptych. The handbag had a picture of Marilyn Monroe printed on the front. I was stunned but aware of what was going on. </p>

<p>I hadn’t understood why I had dreams about paintings until this event occurred. They were precognitive about the inspirational writing idea that I received when I met with the writing group. Finding the <em>Marilyn Diptych</em> picture in the book got me close to coming up with an idea to start my writing. The keys on the table opened up the door to a synchronicity. This manifested in the icons of Mary and Jesus on the table. Seeing the likeness of Marilyn Monroe on the purse was even more verification to pay attention to these events. </p>

<p>My intuition told me to develop a story about the Monroe portrait. The writing just flowed. Within a few days I completed the work. I named it <em>Picture Perfect</em> and the short story was published a few months later. </p>

<p>It took some time to piece together the chain of events but it was well worth it. Some skeptics have said that this was an uncanny coincidence or selective perception on my part. Fortunately, I paid attention to my dreams and had them guide me to accomplish my creative goal.</p>

back in the dream

repeating as a theme

ascending stairs

with pillars in pairs



high ceilings, spacious walls

perfect light falls

this expansive art gallery

seems intriguingly bleary



many paintings discharge

while one portrait is

glowing saintly

preparing me for the

what I need to secure



emotions are added on

by this feminine icon

she makes flowing words

    ns1:description """<p>Are you able to recall dreams? If so, do you write them down? Have you ever tried posing a question before retiring in order to dream a solution? With practice, these concepts can be achieved. Throughout the day, remind yourself: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I want to remember my dreams.”</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>“Upon awakening, I will recall and write down my dreams.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incubating a question helps me to have dreams. </p>

<p>Entice yourself to savor this rejuvenating nightly experience. Create a relaxing environment in your bedroom. Decorate with a dream catcher and soothing srroundings. Maintain a comfortable room temperature. </p>

<p>Before retiring, enjoy your bedtime rituals. Take a warm bath and put on comfortable night clothes. Drink warm milk or herbal tea. Read a few pages on dreaming. There are numerous books on the subject. The internet also has information. Let yourself unwind. </p>

<p>Keep a few items close to the bed so that you don’t have to lift your head or move much upon awakening. It’s easier to recall dreams when you remain in bed with your head on the pillow. Move as little as possible to reach your dream journal, pen and flashlight. If it’s easier for you to verbalize, use a hand held recorder and tape to document your dreams. Do what works best for you. </p>

<p>Dreams and the Tarot deck of cards contain symbology. This form of language can help you gain knowledge about yourself and life. There are many versions of the Tarot. Select a deck that you feel drawn to and take your time getting familiar with them. There are seventy-eight cards in a deck. Fifty-six cards make up the Lower Arcana which are divided into four suites: wands, cups, swords and pentacles. </p>

<p>The Higher Arcana is based on twenty-two archetypes. They can help in your life’s journey when you invoke them in dream incubations. Consider a challenge in which you need help. Ask a specific deity a question on how to deal with your situation. This can bring about a dream that will give you a solution. </p>

<p>Consider the following examples: </p>

<h3>Challenge: Needing a change from your daily routine.</h3>

<p><strong>The Fool Incubation:</strong> How can I be more spontaneous? </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> You dream of driving your car over the state line for a weekend getaway. </p>

<h3>Challenge: Feeling confused about where to start fixing things at home.</h3>

<p><strong>The Magician Incubation:</strong> What is my next domestic project? </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> You dream of painting a fence. </p>

<p>Before going to sleep, write down the date and dream incubation in your dream journal. Draw or select a Higher Arcana archetype that you think will be able to help figure out your given situation. Meditate on the card and question before falling asleep. When you awaken, document your dreams. Don’t hold back, edit or judge what you have experienced. Let the thoughts flow freely. If you can’t remember a dream, jot down symbols, words, thoughts, ideas or anything else that comes to mind. Light your path to wholeness. With time, practice and consistency, you will become more in tune with your inner guide.</p>

His fellow columnist in these pages, Paco Mitchell, responded to his article in an email and this has led to an on-going dialogue between these two old friends. They felt their exchange might be of interest to readers of Dream Network Journal</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Here the two halves of the Dreamgourd are placed together</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> I just re-read your article for the fifth or sixth time. A couple of associations came to me, the result of recently having read a book by Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry called <em>The Universe Story</em>. The book tells the story of the universe, from the original fireball (which they call the “flaring forth”) to the present day. Why should this book have stimulated any associations to your <em>I Ching</em> gourd dream? Bear with me. They discuss the slow development of the Lower and Upper Paleolithic culture, followed by the relatively rapid inventions of the Neolithic period. They pointed out that Neolithic villages have provided a pattern for human survival and development for many thousands of years, enduring throughout the period of ancient and classical civilizations, persisting even into modern times. It is only recently that technological incursions have penetrated the deepest reaches of the furthest outposts, threatening the last remnants of Neolithic culture. What especially impressed me was the author’s insistence on the model of the self-sustaining Neolithic village as a viable alternative for human survival during the <em>post-technozoic</em> future—if there is to be any future for us. Their emphasis was on an appropriately ecological scale of human presence within, and as members of, what they call the “Earth Community.” But another aspect of appropriateness was the bedrock recognition that humans participate in and depend on cosmic forces to which we are all subject. As one example of this recognition, they cited the “throwing of bones” as characteristic of that original, primordial and natural religious attitude. Once the bones leave the human hand, they become subject to the laws and patterns governing the universe, with all the invisible interconnections of chance and necessity pertaining thereto. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf1-1.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Bronze-colored gourd" style="margin: auto;"/></p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>Here, the Dreamgourd is open to reveal the Dreamstones with elemental trigrams and the Dreambowl that holds the dream written out and rolled into a scroll. The dream I shared in DN Vol. 26 No. 3, pgs. 30, 31 will be the focus in consulting the oracle.</i></div>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> I can certainly attest to the numinous quality of the dream, filled as it was with that quality of something <em>other</em>, as well as originating in some <em>other</em> geography than my usual consciousness. And having made the <em>dreamgourd</em>, and now using it in my practice with dreams, I can say that its very existence calls forth a palpable religious dimension. But what, more specifically, was your association? </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Simply, that your <em>dreamgourd</em> and the “new” oracular technique that went with it—insofar as they were both original, spontaneous products of the dreamworld, rather than products of your conscious recall, intention, or cryptomnesia—point back to and simultaneously draw upon the most ancient, primordial sources of human creativity. This is to suggest, according to my intuition, that the creative activity of humans, from the earliest Paleolithic, through the Neolithic, all the way to the present and into the foreseeable future, comes about in large measure as a result of dreaming. Your dream with its gourd, stones and oracular technique, participates in that amazing, panoramic tradition, and even as it points to the past, it also points to the future. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf1-2.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Bronze-colored gourd" style="margin: auto;"/></p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>Here, the hexagram has been cast and the fixed and changing lines determined. The final determination is recorded on the Dreamscroll. This was the first casting.</i></div>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Part of the numinous quality of the dream for me was in the experience of this enduring stream of human history, not so much as something long ago and long forgotten and perhaps remembered only when archaeologists and anthropologists unearth bones, open hidden caves, and expose artifacts of these early cultures; but, as a living reality in the depths of the psyche of a person alive today in this world. And I mean this not as an idea or concept, but as an experience of that reality. Some dreams are able to “go there” and “bring to us” an awareness of this “past” which, as you say, points to the future. What was your second association? </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf1-3.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Bronze-colored gourd" style="margin: auto;"/></p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>The Dreamstones lying in the Dreamgourd</i></div>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> The second association comes from your cave-fingertips-fire dream. I recently re-visited your web page, [see <a href="http://www.ralockhart.com">http://www.ralockhart.com</a> for the dream and image] and later, when I read about the gourd dream, I immediately associated it with the fire dream and with the above reflections. They seemed to belong together. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> I did not immediately associate the two dreams. But when I worked on the etymology of the first hexagram I cast in using the <em>dreamgourd</em>, I realized two things: The first was that the cave that I was in in the dream you refer to, was gourd shaped; Second, that the strange feelings in my fingers as I was making the <em>dreamgourd</em> were echoes of the feeling in the cave dream when I touched the walls of the cave and could feel the markings there that turned out to be an unknown language. Both dreams had that amazing sense of “task” about them to which there was no saying no. In that dream, the “fire” that came from my fingertips enabled me to see. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Swimme and Berry make the point that “the controlled use of fire is the first extensive control of the human over a powerful natural force with almost unlimited possibilities that would be associated with human development over the centuries. Together with the shaping of wooden and stone implements, fire becomes the primordial humanly controlled technology.” </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> I can tell you that the “awe” I experienced in that dream when I rubbed my fingertips together, “remembering” I could make fire that way, must have been something like those early experiences of humans beginning to control fire. In many ways it is the origin of what we mean by technology. So much is hidden in this word we no longer hear, but probably need to, because it gets to the roots of what these early experiences were and which we can once again have access to. That sense of <em>techné</em> as “art,” as “weaving,” as “text” and in the earliest sense, as “becoming.” One might say that when humans learned the art of fire, they became human. The sad thing is that we have lost so much of the sense of this; what is hopeful though, is that these “root” experiences are still available to us, and most especially through dreaming. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> We can see that the intelligence behind Paleolithic and Neolithic oracular practices was refined during the early centuries of Chinese civilization into the magnificent edifice of the <em>I Ching</em>. That intelligence, that “art.” still percolates in the modern psyche—in your dream—possibly showing us ways out of our current impasse—ghastly as it is. I know that’s a lot to expect of a <em>dreamgourd</em> with stones in it, something so simple, so primitive, so... spooky. But it seems to me that further degrees of technical prowess are not really what we need, so much as a re-connection to something more basic in our being. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf1-4.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Bronze-colored gourd" style="margin: auto;"/></p>

<div style="text-align:center"><i>A closeup of the Dreamscroll in its holder</i></div>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Too often, I think, this yearning gets pictured as a romantic “return to the past,” when I do not believe that is the impulse at all in something like the <em>dreamgourd</em>. No, it is more like recovering something we have lost because we will need it to find our way into a sustainable future. I believe this happens one person at a time, and that the telling of these experiences to one another is the Eros that can “spark” a fire in the psyche from one to another. With the possibility of everyone in the world being connected via the Internet, such a “global village” of shared experience of these lost things is becoming more and more possible. The terrible fragmentations and polarities loose in the world now are presaging a momentous enantiodromia, a reversal, that I believe will form the basis of the new paradigm of consciousness that the recovery of our lost soul (which is what dreams are) will make possible. All the old calendrical systems, including the <em>I Ching</em> (which is also a calendar), as well as the science of creative epochs, all point to 2012, as a time point of this “end” of what we now experience as human consciousness. So, no Paco, I think you are right, that something like the <em>dreamgourd</em> dream is the very “stuff” of re-connection, the fabric of it, the weaving of it, the art of it, the technology of it. The eventual “discovery”— or actually, rediscovery—of dreams (which has only just begun) will be as monumental for our fate as the discovery of fire was in the early days of our becoming human. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Well, this fits with something else that Thomas Berry brings out in his book, <em>Dreams of the Earth</em>. He says that in coming to terms with the planetary crisis we need to create a new cultural coding which we can do only by reaching far into the past, beyond the old cultural codes which have brought us to the brink of devastation. We must, he says, make contact with our genetic coding and, out of that, bring forth a new vision of how to live on the earth. In my opinion, dreams such as yours, which reveal “the answers,” are trying to pull us back to Berry’s genetic coding, to the very source of those creative “spontaneities” as he calls them, which alone can bring us back into alignment with the evolutionary development of the universe. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> It seems to me a new angle on what Jung was saying in his letter to Herbert Read: “We have simply got to listen to what the psyche spontaneously says to us. What the dream, which is not manufactured by us, says is just so.” The dream would be one way in which the “new code” would come to us. And... note what else Jung says here: “it is the great dream which has always spoken through the artist as mouthpiece. All his love and passion (his “values”) flow towards the coming guest to proclaim his arrival.” In this sense, the coming guest would be the “new code” Berry is trying to get us to see the urgency of. Imagine what might happen if dreams were welcomed in this spirit! Maybe not today, but someday, it will happen. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Knowledge of the answers, in other words, lies “sealed” within the human, the only barrier between us and that knowledge is the boundary between consciousness and the dream. As you know, in spite of our general resistance to dreams (our cultural coding), that boundary is easily breached, like the wad of clay with which the Egyptians sealed their tombs to determine if the tomb had been violated or not. I also note the Celtic tradition of the “silkie,” a creature part man, part seal, capable of shuttling between the human world of cultural codes and the larger, animal- cosmic world of genetic codes (via dreams or visions). I remember your telling me a dream in which you encountered a seal which told you “the answers,” but which upon waking you could not remember. And then the following night, in the dark, walking along the beach, you tripped over a washed up dead seal, and you sat down with it and tried to remember. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Essentially everything I’ve done since that dream and that encounter with the seal has been trying to remember what I was told and to bring it forth. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I think of silkies as symbolizing the <em>daemon</em> of what Berry calls the “shamanic personality,” which he says is exactly what we need if we are to bridge the chasm between where we are and where we need to be. In this sense, I regard dreams such as yours as “shamanic.” </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> That is easily taken the wrong way, of course. I think the way I can agree with you is to say that we do not need to seek a shaman in someone else, but the shamanic potential in each of us. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Far from being an occasion for ego-inflation, the shamanic potential— when lived—actually brings a sense of responsibility. That’s how you’ve responded to your dreams— ever since I’ve known you, actually. It’s not about flying off on a broomstick. When you say—“the shamanic potential in each of us”—you bring it back down to earth. By the way, your image of dreams being “rediscovered” on a wide scale, is intriguing. I hope you’ll say more about that. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Yes, that would be a good place for us to begin in the next issue.</p>

<p><em>This is the second in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell. The first dialogue—and what prompted this exchange between them—is published in <a href="../bcpov6krdbf1/dreams-bones-and-the-future-1">Dream Network Journal/ Spring 2008. Volume 27 Number 1</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> Last time you said, “The eventual discovery—or actually, rediscovery—of dreams (which has only just begun) will be as monumental for our fate as the discovery of fire was in the early days of our becoming human.” Can you say more about this “rediscovery” of dreams and what it might mean collectively? </p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> Well, the audacity of that statement when reflected back to me is alarming! But then intuitions are frequently alarming. One knows the truth in one’s bones, but then trying to convey that truth to others is about as easy as trying to show someone your living skeleton! However, here are some things embedded in this idea. The first is centrality. Dreams will become once again ever more central and crucial in individual and collective life—in spite of all that animates against this process at the present time. Imagine a collective life at all levels informed and led by dreams! Almost impossible to imagine, but I believe it’s coming. The second is continuity. At present, our experience of the reality of psyche is terribly discontinuous— dreams are disconnected from our daily life, synchronicities are separated so as to seem unrelated, we experience our own dream life as not connected with the dream life of others, or with the world. But, at bottom, we are all linked by a kind of rhizome layer. There is the appearance of discontinuity only because our consciousness “dips in” from time to time and there is much that works against dipping in at all. But the future will bring the discovery that we are all connected at the rhizome level, that the full story of our dream life and the dream life not only of others but of all things is accessible there. The third is circulation. I think of the image of Aquarius here, the Water Carrier, which I imagine as individuals immersing themselves in the rhizomic layer and “bringing back,” that is, telling in words and deeds or in other ways, the “story” of what was experienced there. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I can imagine lots of different forms of public telling: books, articles, poems, songs, plays, films, conferences, rituals, dream-groups, discussion-groups, etc. But private telling as well—dreamsharing between couples, friends, parents and children, with strangers, and so on. Is there a fourth aspect?  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> The fourth is what I think of as coming—and I mean this in all its senses. We have hints of a climax of some inordinate dimension coming. While futurists such as Ray Kurzweil see that “the singularity is near,” and argue that it will be technology that ushers in “the Great Coming,” I think rather it will have more to do with the advent of “the Coming Guest,” that spirit of the future foreseen by (George Russell, the Irish poet) and by Carl Jung. I think people far and wide are experiencing what I call “inchoate anticipations” of this singularity in their numinous dreams and synchronistic experiences. What is it that will be born from this orgasmic singularity that all of humanity will experience? I tend to think that our consciously directed visions will fail us and that we will need to look with a more welcoming spirit to art and dreams to even begin to get a sense of what is coming. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> This resonates with what I came to in “Dreaming Planet” <em>(Dream Network Journal Volume 26, Numbers 3 &amp; 4; Volume 27, Number 1)</em>, where I expressed the hope that—if enough of us pool the wisdom we sometimes encounter in our dreams—a new jolt of evolutionary energy may work its way into consciousness in time to help humanity shed its skin and manifest whatever is trying to be born. What you say brings to mind this dream from the early 80s, which may be an example of what you are calling “anticipations.” In the first part</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...American military planes are returning from battle and they are dirty and dilapidated. They all turn into one large commercial airliner, likewise dirty and dilapidated, which subsequently crashes. Out of the wreckage rise four large, iridescent, translucent spheres. They are named: Gold, Silver, Zephyr and Harmonium. They stop in front of me. I feel they have some intention in regard to me. I go into a building and tell a dignified, authoritative woman what I have seen. “Yes,” she says, “people are working on that</em> (i.e., the four spheres) <em>all over the world.” The fourth sphere is somehow associated with the image of a tree.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> You know, when people hear dreams (or read them), they invariably ask, “What does this mean?” This, I believe, is a disruptive question. A more circulatory response would be to attend to what hearing the dream arouses. “Understanding” the dream is not nearly as important as following the hints the dream generates. That is what I call the Eros function of a dream and in that regard dreams are more like stories to be continued than objects to be put under the microscope of understanding. You had that dream some twenty-years ago or so, and even then, there is that clear image of people working on the spheres all over the world. Many people are working in isolation I am sure. What a difference it would make if more people knew of this! </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Here’s a more current dream that seems to work along the same lines: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A foundry has been setup in an outdoor location. The terrain is sloping and uneven. People are lined up in a long, serpentine column, waiting for their sculptures to be cast in bronze. Each person has made one piece. To my surprise, I am free to wander around observing without hindrance. I walk over to where the metal is to be poured, the “crucial” area where the “crucible” is used. As the first mold is being positioned for pouring, I see a very large hydraulic/mechanical arm swing toward the pouring area. It crashes into the mold and breaks it. Nevertheless, it seems, in the confusion, that the first mold has somehow been poured. The arm is holding a slightly tilted crucible. I see the molten metal inside and can tell that it is beginning to crystallize, which means that there is not much time left to carry out the remaining pours. If the metal gets too cold, it will stop flowing and will solidify inside the crucible. Suddenly, though, the first broken mold falls away and I see a perfectly round, polished bronze sphere</em> (in realistic terms of a rough casting, this would be an impossibility). <em>It is a stunning sight. My impression is that there is a relationship between the breaking of the mold by the “large arm” and the paradoxical perfection of the resulting casting, i.e., the perfect sphere emerges from “out of the wreckage.”</em>  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Imagine, everyone with their own individual sculpture! What a contrast to the current craze of near viral mimetic duplication where everyone wants to be like someone or something else. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Imagine how many other similar dreams are being witnessed each night by the “planetary dream brigade,” and what a spectacular benzene-ring those dreams would form, if only they could be brought to light. Hopefully, we can bring some of them forth “before the metal freezes.”  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Yes, your dream has a sense of urgency and I see this same sense of urgency in many dreams of this nature. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I recall Jung referring to “the last fifty years of civilization” just before he died in 1961. That puts his time point around the same 2012 that is so much the object of focus now. We don’t have forever to carry out the transformations implicit in the dream. Yet, to say that the situation is urgent doesn’t necessarily mean we have to “speed things up.” In fact, the opposite may be true. There is that Zen story where the Master addresses his monks: “There are many urgent tasks that we must attend to, and little time. Therefore, we must slow down.”  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Precisely the quality that is near extinction, but so vitally needed now. Only then would we be able to experience “the joy that dwells far within slow time,” as the poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O%27Donohue">John O'Donohue</a> tells us in <em>A Blessing for One Who is Exhausted</em>, a poem that might just be the necessary medicine for the exhaustion one hears as a wailing lament everywhere these days. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> “Lament” is a good word for it. I can imagine the world‘s symptoms— both on personal and environmental levels—laments for the loss of “slowtime.” By the way, Russ, can you say more about the idea that synchronicities are so separated as to seem unrelated?  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Synchronicities impact us so strongly because, for a brief moment, the “veil” that normally hides what Keats called the “penetralium of mystery”—that rhizomic layer I referred to earlier—is pulled aside and we have a momentary glimpse of our fate. These encounters range from invoking only mild curiosity to the most profound, stunning, even life-altering experiences of the conjoining of two “realms” of life. But synchronicities are not isolated events. There is a theme or motif, some “thread of destiny” that links synchronicities together, as if periodically we stepped into a darkened theatre to witness the play going on there and tried from these momentary and periodic glimpses to “make sense” of them. It is hard, some times near impossible. But there is a play, a story, going on behind the veil— of that I am convinced. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> An example?  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> I was a kid about 8 years old, horsing around with my Cub Scout buddies on a mountain trail. At one point, I lost my footing and began to tumble down, was getting pretty bashed up, when suddenly I “saw” a huge owl in the sky and its speech penetrated me: “Grab the tree.” I smashed into a small tree, breaking my fall, and held on as the owl instructed. That tree was the last thing in my way before going over the precipice and my certain death. This is synchronistic because of the conjunction in time of two realities. That owl saved my life. But all synchronicities have an “intention.” So, I must ask, “What for?” Since then there have been many synchronicities involving owls... in dreams, visions, and real owls as well. I feel as though I was inducted or initiated into... into what? When I look at these synchronicities across all these years, now I see they form something like stepping stones, a story-path if you will. I think this is what you are pointing to as well in your articles in these pages, on the way dreams reveal one’s destiny and fate. And you know how “animated” (as if animals were somehow involved) synchronicities have become between us since we began this dialogue. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I’ve also been thinking about all these remarkable synchronistic events we’ve been experiencing on both sides of our exchange. In particular, I’m intrigued by the owls. I’ve never dreamed about owls, to my knowledge, until recently. I still think there is a connection between the owl and the heron (my totem animal, so to speak). In myth, the heron is definitely associated with dawn whereas the owl is largely nocturnal. But then why did I once see a heron fishing at 1:00 AM on a cloudy, moonless night? I learned from an optometrist that herons have a <em>tapetum lucidem</em>—a layer of reflective cells at the back of their eye, like all nocturnal creatures: owls, mice, cats. Seeing into the dark–what a gift! The planet has been spinning since its inception; every creature is conditioned by diurnality. Therefore, we’re programmed for light and dark phases—above all, the animals, who were here long before humans. They carry so much more history than we do, and still they seek us out in our dreams and synchronicities, apparently for the purpose of dispensing their evolutionary wisdom, teaching us the value of seeing into the dark. Your early “tumbling” experience shows what life-savers they can be. Maybe someday we humans will remember just how vitally important they really are to us.  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Jung decried the loss of the animal spirit and felt it had a lot to do with the loss of vitality across the whole dimension of religious experience. The animals went the way of dreams in formalized religions, so the animals took up residence, as it were, in the dream world. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Yes, the dove of Aphrodite, the eagle of Zeus, the owl of Athena, the heron of the Egyptians and Greeks, the phoenix of the Romans—all virtually subsumed by the dove of the Christian Holy Spirit. But then the Holy Spirit itself has been subsumed by the Materialistic Spirit that has become the world’s religion. Where did that Holy Spirit as Paraclete go? Into the unconscious. And now it is pressing and forcing its way into consciousness through whatever cracks and channels are open to it: accidents, injuries, dreams, synchronicities, drug experiences, meditation, prayer... ecstasies” of all kinds.  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Yes, those are all places of “inchoate anticipations” of what is coming, what cannot be held back. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> In my opinion, humanity has reached a crucial choke-point, a funnel through which everything that will happen in the near future must pass. The amplitude of time that allowed the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans such leisurely elaborations of their myths is foreclosed to us. The funnel, like a venturi, or even a tornado, accelerates our experience of time to a disorienting degree. Our new myth will be born out of compressions of time and space such as we have never seen before. The best, most hopeful comparison I can think of is the compounding of heavy elements in the heart of an exploding star, or perhaps, in more earthly terms, the subterranean mystery of diamonds.  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Sounds like something we should dream on, Paco. </p>

<p><em>This is the third in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> Russ, at the beginning of our <a href="../bcpov6krdbf2/dreams-bones-and-the-future-2">Dialogue #2</a> you said: “But, at bottom, we are all linked by a kind of rhizome layer.” That’s a huge statement. For centuries we’ve labored under the opposite assumption, that we’re not all linked, that we’re separate, that the universe is a machine, even that we are machines. We’ve devoted ourselves to the principle that knowledge is served by slicing everything into finer and finer discrete pieces—we know more and more about less and less. But with a knowledge of the parts came control over the whole—or so we thought. We were bound to become... Masters of the Universe! </p>

<p>But now you speak of another level of knowing that has escaped the attention of our restless blade, like a baby in the bulrushes, hidden from Herod’s soldiers. This “rhizome layer” is some kind of unitary phenomenon that underlies consciousness. I’ve been thinking of it, provisionally, in terms of “continuous time,” as a way to contrast it from the “discontinuous time” that goes with our Western mind-set. </p>

<p>Current modes of thought scarcely admit the existence of your “rhizome,” even though it amounts to one of the most primordial of experiences. We need a different means of approach that will enable us to see into the darkness of what, in former ages, was common knowledge. This would amount to a new way of knowing... but one that is also very old. </p>

<p>In his book The <em>Dream of the Earth</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Berry">Thomas Berry</a> evokes the “shamanic personality” as something we urgently need to cultivate, now and in the future. To do this we must recover an old way of seeing imaginatively, but in the light of present knowledge. I understand the shamanic personality as a certain disposition—imaginative, poetic, alert to dreams and synchronicities, capable of discerning the patterns that emerge from both waking and dreaming experience. In short, a disposition to recognize the “imaginal realm”—Henri Corbin’s mundus imaginalis—as real. The shamanic personality, it would seem, is well-suited to healing the rift between the continuous time of the rhizomic layer, and the discontinuous time of modern consciousness. </p>

<p>Of course, we need to re-educate ourselves in those imaginative ways, which are so legion as to constitute a virtual labyrinth! How do you orient yourself in the face of these possibilities and how would you suggest others orient themselves? </p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> This labyrinth of possibilities is a core image, to be sure, and captures well the problem set before us. I want to say, first, that I do not think “orienting” can be codified, no matter how intense the effort. Think of Daedalus and his son Icarus in the labyrinth. So, following myth, we have the Icarian grand schemes whose promise always seems to melt away and crash; or, the Daedalian inventiveness that raises us just enough and over the edge to freedom, but generally freedom only to go on about what was before. </p>

<p>I remember now that my father-in-law wrote a poem, “In A Labyrinth,” in which—in contrast to the myth— something different happened: “I saw a tiniest crevice—see?” Well, an entirely different story unfolds from that, does it not? Thus, I see that an orientation to the “labyrinth of imaginative possibilities” is itself highly individual. </p>

<p>For myself, I pay most attention to what “presents” itself. Just now, for example, the memory of something I read in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fowles">John Fowles’</a> essay, <em>The Tree</em>, presented itself in my experience. Does it belong here? I don’t know that it does, yet I trust that it does. Fowles first described standing in the world’s most perfect garden, at least since the Garden of Eden. It was Carl Linnaeus’ garden, the embodiment of the spirit of Linnaeus’ “ordering of nature,” which to this day, determines so much not only how we “see” order in nature, but as well how we try to “order” the nature of our lives. Fowles declared himself a Linnaean heretic and even reveled in the fact that Linnaeus, at the end of his life, had gone completely mad. </p>

<p>Fowles then goes on to describe an experience of his childhood. An elderly man in his neighborhood had gone mad upon the death of his wife and simply withdrew from the world. What had been an orderly landscape turned to seed and weeds took over; all manner of “undesirable elements” took hold. It became a complete eyesore, blighting the neighborhood, the very antithesis of that for which we strive. Yet, into this complete horror, as Fowles walked by one day, landed Britain’s rarest bird, a waxwing, nibbling happily on a crop of wild berries. How does one prepare for that? </p>

<p>I know only that most of the time we are preparing distractedly against it and this is terribly costly to our soul and our spirit. So, this response to your question is itself an example of how I orient myself. </p>

<p>And... here’s something more. When I remembered that image from my father-in-law’s poem, I knew I had the title of the book I want to publish of his poems: Poems from the Crevice. Then, I asked my wife to find me a picture of him to use on the cover, and she gave me a small photograph that had been folded and so had an “imperfection” running across it. There was the crevice! The cover designed itself in my imagination and I sat right down and laid it out— as you can see in the accompanying picture. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf3-0.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Man standing in a blue suit on a book cover" style="margin: auto;"/><div style="text-align:center"><i>Book cover of Russ’ father-in-law’s poetry</i></div></p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> So, you orient yourself to imaginative possibilities by paying attention to accidents, imperfections and the unexpected—“gifts of the imagination,” we might say... threads that lead us further <em>into</em> the labyrinth, not out of it. </p>

<p>This suggests an artistic sensibility. A poet, for example, catches aleatory images, like butterflies in a net, dresses them up in words and borrows them to craft a poem. A scientist reading a numerical printout scans for anomalies in the “data”— that which is given—and from those unexpected patterns develops a theory. Your trust in the face of not-knowing is a bit unusual. Not everybody is as comfortable with uncertainty as you. You see opportunities in chance events—openings to another level of reality. And it is not directed consciousness that you apply to the initiatory event but a deeper sensitivity, perhaps even an “animal knowing.” Something about the moment fits an unconscious pattern. And something in you—in us— recognizes it. </p>

<p>I think of that something as a “subliminal knowing witness.” And you have learned, by experience and inclination, to trust, to listen to, this subtle witness. Who or what is the knowing witness? We can say, “Oh, that’s just intuition at work.” Fair enough. But I suspect there’s more to it than that. Something closer to an imaginal person, a “who” more than a “what”—whether the person be animal, human or both. From within the shadowy penumbra of our consciousness, this “something” directs our attention toward the scintillae sparkling there—a topic we might take up elsewhere. </p>

<p>You mention John Fowles’ story about how Linnaeus, after a lifetime of obsessively and devoutly classifying nature, went mad. It reminds me of Goya’s etching “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters.” </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf3-1.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Man attacked by demonic birds" style="margin: auto;"/><div style="text-align:center"><i>“The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters” by Goya</i></div></p>

<p>Perhaps if Linnaeus had listened to Goya’s owls, or had paid more attention to the “tiniest crevice” your father-in-law wrote about, Linnaeus might not have ended his life in madness. As it was, he exemplified the scientific spirit of his time, and he paid a price for the inherent imbalance within that spirit, the fantasy of rational control over nature. Goya’s etchings—Los Caprichos or the “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters” Goya “whims”—illustrated some of the dangers of that imbalance. And we’re still paying the price today. But your approach elevates hidden nuances and overlooked subtleties. How? By allowing your attention and interest—your libido to be deflected toward the background of consciousness? Let’s call that a kind of “liminal vision”—seeing into the dark—and recognize that it leads us toward the rhizome layer. The imaginal realm. The creative unconscious. The dream. So when you say you orient yourself to the imagination with whatever “presents” itself, you often start with what is small, negligible. But as you follow the trail of hints, you are led to larger and larger patterns, which together begin to reveal the rhizome. This is as much a way of working with dreams as of composing books, or writing poems.  </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Yes, further and further <em>into</em> the labyrinth would be another way entirely and one that would be a recovery of something long lost. Imagine, thirty-two thousand years ago, Paleolithic peoples ventured into those labyrinthine caves, deeper and deeper and it was then, in the deepest recesses, where they painted the most incredible images on the cave walls. I’m reminded of what Picasso said when he saw the cave paintings at Lascaux: “They’ve invented everything.” Now, why go so deep just to paint images of what is so available on the surface? Why this art at all? It remains a deep mystery. But my intuition tells me that this was not an exercise in rendering life-like images of bulls and horses and rhinos but more the expression of the animal’s role in the primogeniture of the human imagination itself as well as giving expressed vision to the dreams those animals induced in early humans. That’s one reason I think that in these early expressions there are so few human images. The walls are alive almost exclusively with animals. In this there was a kind of rhizomic integrity of world, imagination and dream. I think history can be read as a progressive fragmentation, a violent fracturing into disconnected shards of what must have been a more integral world. We have lost much; but for this very reason, we have much to gain. So, yes, I believe deeper into the labyrinth is the way to that recovery. You know, after writing this paragraph, I had a dream. In the dream, </p>

<p><em>I see outside a tiger moving along a path. There is a sense that everyone fears the tiger. But I know I must go and greet the tiger and to pet it as I do my own cat Samantha. I do that and the tiger rolls over on its back and I rub its belly as I do Samantha’s when she does that, and the tiger extends its paw to me and I grasp it and we “shake hands.” I can see that the tiger is enjoying this immensely as do I</em> and I wake up with tears in my eyes from the utter joy of this encounter. I don’t have a cave wall but I will find a way to bring this animal into visible manifestation! </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> What a moving dream! “Enjoyment” is the correct word. The tears make sense as a response to the deep joy of holding the tiger’s paw. It’s a potential connection that we all carry within us, but have mostly forgotten. Russ, there’s something important here—your intuition about Lascaux, combined with the subsequent, powerful dream of the tiger. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf3-2.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="Bison on a cave wall" style="margin: auto;"/><div style="text-align:center"><i>Cave paintings at Lascaux</i></div></p>

<p>It’s as if the dream, though it was not created by you, nevertheless came as a validation of your intuition. Even more, it is as if someone sought to validate your intuition. Let’s take it even one step further: It is as if the tiger sought to validate your intuition. For it’s difficult to escape the impression that there is some kind of consciousness or awareness in and behind these dreams. And where there is conscious awareness there is something personal—i.e., a “personality”— even (or maybe especially) if it comes to us in the form of a Tiger. Of course, we’re accustomed to thinking of our connection with animals either mythically—as in the Book of Genesis (even when interpreted literally)—or as “merely” physical, in the evolutionary sense of “vestiges”: bones, sinews and organs. But the persistence of psyche over time extending as it does as much into the future as it does into the past, therefore permits an extension of “personality” in both directions as well. </p>

<p>This suggests that those Paleolithic artists or shamans who wriggled and squirmed their way down into the deepest caverns for the purpose, as you hinted, of giving form to the animals who made up their imaginal cosmos, probably experienced those very same animals as “personalities”— i.e., persons—living presences who came to them bearing messages, warnings, teachings and blessings. Who is to say that, in those times, they did not in some fashion speak the same language? The animals, after all, were the already ancient “ancestors” of those earliest humans. It might not be too far-fetched to see in these animal persons parading through the human psyche over the millennia, prefigurations of what later humans called “angels.”</p>

<p><em>This is the fourth in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> At the end of our last dialogue, we imagined ourselves deep underground in the caves at Lascaux, looking up at Paleolithic paintings of animals. We marveled at the paintings themselves and wondered about the state of mind of the hunters/artists/shamans who painted them. </p>

<p>As I later mulled over your insights and intuitions, I thought about the vast gulf separating humans today from those early periods, especially where animals are concerned. In no phase of history during the past several thousand years were we ever so utterly dependent on animals as early humans were during Paleolithic times—before the advent of agriculture. (We could say that the ratio of importance between animals and humans for Paleolithic nomads was practically one-to-one. Agriculture introduced a multiplier into the equation, since one ox could plow many acres and help produce millions of grains, thus supporting a larger human population.) The very life of the nomadic tribes, however, depended in high degree on the individual animals they hunted, so they recognized in those animals the source of life. The central importance of animals thus gave rise to ritual forms of worship, cults and cosmologies and the campfire stories of an indispensable oral tradition. </p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> Of course, that state of mind, although lasting thousands of years, finally gave way to another spirit... what I like to call the cornucopian spirit—the advent of agriculture. The cornu of that word is the goat’s horn, so here is the transition image of the animal from earlier time, albeit only a piece and not the whole dynamic image we saw in the caves. The copia refers to the abundant outflowing from the horn, the full measure of grains, and flowers, and fruits— literally the great harvest of the “above ground” earth.</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I’m reminded of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade">Eliade’s</a> <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forge_and_the_Crucible">The Forge and the Crucible</a></em>, where he draws a remarkable parallel between the distant Paleolithic past and our current situation and future outlook. I think it’s worth quoting at length: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As for the crises of the modern world, we must bear in mind that this world inaugurates a completely new type of civilization. It is not possible to foresee its future developments. But it is useful to remember that the only revolution comparable to it in the past history of humanity, that is, the discovery of agriculture, provoked upheavals and spiritual breakdowns whose magnitude the modern mind finds it well-nigh impossible to conceive. An ancient world, the world of nomadic hunters, with its religions, its myths, its moral conceptions, was ebbing away. Thousands and thousands of years were to elapse before the final lamentations of the old world died away, forever doomed by the advent of agriculture.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliade continues: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One must suppose that the profound spiritual crisis aroused by man’s decision to call a halt and bind himself to the soil, must have taken many hundreds of years to become completely integrated. It is impossible to imagine the upheaval of all values caused by the changeover from the nomadic to the sedentary life and to appreciate its psychological and spiritual repercussions. The technical discoveries of the modern world, its conquest of Time and Space, represent a revolution of similar proportions, the consequences of which are still very far from having become part of us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Eliade's reference to the conquest of time and space could as well be thought of as the “triumph of light” over darkness, epitomized by the electric light that has severed the human tether to the light and dark cycle those Paleoliths lived by so intimately. But, oh, the unintended consequences! <em>National Geographic</em> recently in a cover story entitled “The End of Night: Why We Need Darkness,” speaks to our lost connection with the sky in urban centers and the cost of this “constant light,” not only in energy terms, but in disturbing our biological rhythms and portending major consequences to our health and well-being. I was struck by the inside front pages of this issue in an advertisement showing just those images from Lascaux right along with IBM's new slogan: Stop Talking, Start Doing. Yes, but doing what? Well, my response, as you well know, is something on the order of “Do the Dream.”</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> There must be something about deep darkness itself that invites and impels the human psyche to seek out, “to do,” if you will, transformative states. Partly this results from the protection “cave-consciousness” affords against sensory distractions (e.g., John Lilly’s isolation tank). Therefore we often close our eyes or “go blank” when we are trying to concentrate on an image or a thought. Caves, graves, catacombs, tombs, ossuaries, cemeteries, pyramids, sweat lodges, wilderness, deserts, forests, deep glades, basements, attics, closets, tunnels, dark taverns and pubs, abandoned places, remote places, small places, tents, mummy sleeping bags, dream helmets and, of course, dreams themselves—how many actual places have humans found, built, discovered and sought out in their effort to stay connected to the primordial, living imagination? Dreams may be the most direct opening we have today if we wish to enter the imaginal depths. They are not the only means of access, to be sure, but they are the most ubiquitous. Interestingly, we can still see in dreams—in their images, their mythic patterns, their amazing associative nature, their implication in synchronicities, their tendency to reflect totalities—remnants of that Paleolithic experience which you called the “rhizomic integrity of world, imagination and dream.” What Thomas Berry called the “shamanic personality,” then, is available—in principle—to anyone, virtually given, with close enough attention to dreams, or to dreamlike states.</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Your comments are rich loam indeed! I'm glad you refer to Eliade, as his fertile work seems largely neglected now and deserves a fresh reading. His vision of the modern world spawning a “spiritual breakdown” recalls the Hopi prophecy of the two paths that increasingly confront the world's people and the choice that each person must make. The Hopi called these the path of the two-hearted (the “fate of the world be damned” attitude that pervades nearly every dimension of our existence) and the path of the one-hearted (whose heads are one with their heart and whereby the fate of the earth becomes a primary concern). I am seeing these prophecies cited more and more but nowhere more poignantly than in singer and songwriter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060213002142/http://kristinerobin.com/sitemode/defaulthtml.asp">Kristine Robin's</a> on-line video called “Are we creating the world of our dreams?” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060203044258/www.kristinerobin.com/worldofdreams/oneisthesun.html">http:www.kristinerobin.com/worldofdreams/oneisthesun.html</a>). After seeing this video one might well say the world is becoming ever more a nightmare. But, like Kristine Robin, I'm basically an optimist, and so I look for ways to alter what seems like an inevitable flood of increasingly disastrous consequences of the dominance by the power and the rapaciousness of the two-hearted.</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> One way to counteract the destructive flood is to “listen” for Merlin's Cry, as it echoes the earlier lamentations of the old stone-age shamans. In effect, the unconscious itself is crying out for recognition, not just the “shadow side” of modern life or the dark side of the individual personality, but the deepest reaches out of which modern consciousness itself slowly evolved. And, as you have said so many times, this cry for recognition cannot be denied.</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> You have noted that Berry is calling for a kind of “rescue” by a hoped-for and wide-spread emergence of the shamanic personality. I like to think of this as an increasing possibility of emergent access to the shamanic potential in each person stimulated by the present extremities. We are not in want of gurus. The very idea of guru has become ever more commodified, so that we now have a “guru industry.” We need not seek out true or false shamans either in far away places or the nearest talk show, nor become apprentices for decades of training, or pay huge sums. I don't deny the value of those honest shamanic traditions. But the time is now for each and every person of the earth to seek the shamanic potential in themselves. And where is that potential? As you say, “dreams may be the most direct opening we have today.” I agree. Yet, look at any magazine or at the ads on TV and—as I forewarned years ago in these pages—you will see ever increasing use of the word or idea of dream in these mechanisms of commodification. An enormous effort is being made to associate dream and money. Not that anyone will pay you for your dream, but instilling in you the “triggers” of consumption so that you will dream what you then will feel impelled to buy—ah!—that is the dream of all advertising! In this way dreams too will become subject to the commodification of desire. Still, the dream itself remains remarkably subversive to this process and for that reason my optimism remains high. I am working on this in a book I'm calling Commodification of Desire. </p>

<p>I have emphasized in these pages on several occasions that every dream has to do—not with the past—but with the future. Let me add another layer of brashness to this assertion and say that every dream is a portal to shamanic potential, every dream a portal to the hidden caves of imaginal reality, every dream a potential gateway to rhizomic consciousness. </p>

<p>But, as you say, not in dreams only. Also in those “pregnant” moments where time itself seems to open up what Lorca called, “something else.” What I have in mind is not only those momentous synchronistic events which literally cannot be ignored, but those more frequent, almost everyday moments of experience passing through our consciousness like minute sparks only momentarily perceived, if at all. These too are portals. Let me give you a recent example related to our dialogue of what I mean. </p>

<p>In our last dialogue, I recalled the poem entitled “Magic Words'” by Edward Field, as a perfect example of some of the things we had been talking about. Before I could write out the words of the poem I had to find it because it was not fully in my memory. I knew the poem was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Rothenberg">Jerome Rothenberg's</a> <em>Shaking the Pumpkin</em>, but I couldn't find that book—not yet unpacked for shelving in my newly renovated office space. But I did have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bly">Robert Bly's</a> <em>News of the Universe: Poems of Twofold Consciousness</em> and I knew it was in there—and that is where I looked it up in order to quote in our dialogue. The next day I was at the library, and decided to see if I could find Field's original work, where the poem first appeared as he attempted to distill the songs and stories he learned from Knut Rasmussen's explorations of the Inuit. They did not have the book, but they did have two copies of his Magic Words—his volume of poems inspired by the Inuit stories and songs. However, there was no copy on the shelf. So where were the two copies? As I had done a number of times on other occasions, I put in a request for the book to be found. This they did and the next day I received notice that the book awaited my return to the library. </p>

<p>Before I went to the library, I unpacked more books as well as bringing in a number of pieces of art and other things that had been in storage for more than seven years since I closed my office in 2001. When I went to the library, I discovered to my surprise that the reason I had not been able to find the book was that it had been shelved in the children's section. Stupid me! I should have looked at the card catalog more carefully. Now, with the book in hand, I looked for the poem that gave the book its title and the one I quoted in the dialogue. The book was illustrated with what were called the “mystical paintings” of Stefano Vitale. </p>

<p>What I saw momentarily took my breath away. Here is Vitale's painting—a driftwood image with a person at one end and an animal at the other. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf4-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Two headed driftwood in an open book" style="width: 300px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>Now look at the piece of drift wood I had that very morning brought out of 7 years of storage— a gift from someone then living in Alaska! </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf4-1.jpg" height="auto" alt="Driftwood" style="width: 300px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>How, then, does such a congeries of “ordinary” events become a portal to rhizomic consciousness? It begins first, I think, in the capacity of these events to “stop” the flow of intentional consciousness, as if a far-off voice was calling. The “portal” exists in that moment of stopping. Still, unless these moments are profoundly synchronistic or deeply disturbing, intentional consciousness recovers quickly from the awkward moment and like a wave breaks over the portal and access to it washes away.</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Russ, I like what you said about the “frequent, almost everyday moments of experience passing through our consciousness like minute sparks.” That such moments can become openings to the “shamanic imagination” means that everyday experience can produce imaginal yields similar to dreams or synchronicities, an exciting thought indeed. This outlook places the creative imagination within reach of anyone. You also caution, however, that our habitual modern attitude— what you call “intentional consciousness”— predisposes us to rush past the sparks, quickly backfilling the breaches in our attention that might otherwise lead to our deepening. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Barfield">Owen Barfield</a>, in <em>The Rediscovery of Meaning</em>, has much to say about this. He refers to what is nowadays called “lucid dreaming", about which much has been made recently: a person dreams, and at the same time is aware of dreaming. Barfield finds in this phenomenon a useful pattern with which to differentiate between “intentional consciousness” and what you and I are variously calling the shamanic imagination, the eternal present, the creative imagination or the rhizome. Barfield locates lucid dreaming within the unusual category of “extraordinary consciousness” which, he declares, is not only subjective, but also includes what we now think of as “objective” phenomena. In fact, for Barfield, extraordinary consciousness— though associated with poetic vision and lucid dreams—is every bit as real as “rocks, stones and trees.” He equates this state of mind with what he calls original participation, the archaic mode of imaginative interaction between man and nature that “people took for granted as happening. That is why they were able to perceive mythical beings in trees and animals.” </p>

<p>Using lucid dreaming as a model, then, Barfield conceives of imaginative vision in general as “extraordinary consciousness—not just the dream stage, but the whole gamut of it—present with ordinary consciousness.” This subtly profound statement amounts to a resounding affirmation of your idea of the “minute sparks in ordinary experience.” </p>

<p>Your notion of “openings” that can lead to a deeper awareness, reminds me of the old engraving of the philosopher peering through a “crack in the world.” To me, the philosopher seems drawn toward the opening, not by accident, but by deliberate search. It is as if he left “village consciousness” behind, and was actually looking for the minute sparks that would lead him to a vision of the rhizome, symbolized by the Medieval mind as a Divine Realm of gears, orbits and spheres. I also note that he is crawling on his hands and knees. This suggests a willingness to forego the ego’s normal drive toward domination, even if only for a moment, in order to follow the hints that most often appear at the boundaries of our conscious awareness. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf4-2.jpg" height="auto" alt="Medieval style globe" style="width: 300px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>Your insight, as I understand it, invites the cultivation of a certain attitude: humility in the face of the unknown, a willingness to follow hints that others might disparage, and courage of a kind we are not accustomed to honor. These might well be qualities of the Hopi “oneheartedness” that you mentioned, so desperately needed in the face of the alternative “two-hearted” refusal to heed the cry of the suffering Earth. </p>

<p>Notice, finally, that the artist of the engraving placed a magnificent tree at the virtual center of the image. I cannot but help recall the image of the tree that appeared in my dream of the four large, iridescent spheres we discussed earlier. The litany of their names—almost an incantation—emphasizes the fourth element by capping the sequence of traditional elements with a surprising name, but also by mysteriously aligning it with the image of a tree. And what again were the names? Gold, Silver, Zephyr and... Harmonium. The tree, of course, as one of the oldest symbols, stands right in our midst, a living reminder of your sparks. </p>

<p>In your book <em>Psyche Speaks</em>, you said: “It was the poet, Paul Valéry, who observed the subtle irony that we understand ourselves thanks only to our speed past words.” Perhaps Valéry would agree that our speed past words is also a speed past those everyday moments, the “minute sparks,” you refer to here. It seems clear enough, then, that a deeper understanding of both ourselves and the world would come about if we could periodically “recuse” ourselves, so to speak, from the lock-step frenetics of modern time, and open ourselves to Barfield’s extraordinary consciousness or Eliade’s eternal present, both of which are implicit in your rhizome.</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> While looking for something else recently, I came across Eliade's journal from 1957-1969, called No Souvenirs. I mention it because I had forgotten Eliade's fiction, and most particularly, his book, <em>The Forbidden Forest</em>. He says of this book, "I still believe one day that <em>The Forbidden Forest</em> and other books will be discovered". I don't think that day has arrived. The last time it was checked out in my local library was 1981! I was quite taken by the importance Eliade attached to his writing of fiction. He says, "For me the writing of fiction—sketches, novellas, novels—was more than a violon d'Ingres: it was my only means of preserving my mental health, of avoiding a neurosis". I think what Eliade is alluding to here is specifically the importance of the imagination as we have been talking about it. Of course today we are drowning in medications for our ills. As far as I know, no one is prescribing a dose of imagination, fiction as Rx, for what troubles us. We might do well to listen to Eliade.</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I wonder if the title <em>The Forbidden Forest</em> is a Merlin reference?</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Not that he would say so but I believe it is so, and like Merlin's cry, it is the imagination itself that remains to be discovered in ways we do not yet comprehend. In this regard, I am so pleased you bring up Owen Barfield, another giant who is scarcely noticed today. It was Barfield who had shown C. S. Lewis (<em>The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Space Trilogy</em>), that mythology was essential to language and literature— one might say, more exactly, the mytho-poetic imagination. But Lewis had trouble fully believing this. One day, Lewis and Tolkien were out walking, and Lewis said to the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, " ...ultimately they are worthless, because they are lies". "No", Tolkien shouted, "They are not lies!" Just then, an extraordinary wind came up and blew leaves all about them and they stood there, holding their breath, suspended in wonder. When they began talking again, Tolkien used this as an example of the "truth" of myth. It is a clear example of what you refer to in Barfield's claim concerning original participation, that archaic mode of imaginative interaction between man [these two giants of the twentieth century] and nature [a most curious wind at just the "right moment"]. As Barfield noted, in referring to the Paleolithic (but also to two moderns walking the paths at Oxford University): "That is why they were able to perceive mythical beings in trees and animals". </p>

<p>The imagination of these men, along with T.S. Elliot, Charles Williams, and others, collectively known as <em>"The Inklings"</em>, catches hold of us even today and reminds us that it is the imagination—alive as sparks in everyday consciousness, sparks that break into our intentional consciousness— that offer themselves as portals to a vast underground. Vaster still than anything we have ever found. I believe that Barfield is correct when he says that the imagination is as real both in its deep subjectivity and its far-reaching objectivity as the "rocks, stones, and trees". Your Harmonium dream is such an amazing example of this! </p>

<p>You know, Paco, I think in many ways we have become prisoners of the high achievements of the the agricultural revolution, that achievement being the major cultural institutions—all those storehouses of the grains we call "culture". Perhaps we are in the advent of a new revolution, perhaps a new nomadism, perhaps one that begins in what Keats called negative capability, when one "is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason". In that space, the portals of imagination, like gateways, open to a "new world", open to exploration in ways that are only hinted at by what we have mentioned so far in these dialogues, and even more so by that to which we have not yet spoken. Dreams, as I have tried to make clear, are "calling" us to "explore the future", to enter into the rhizomic womb and to participate in the birth of what is to come.</p>

<p><em>This is the fifth in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> At the end of our last dialogue, I was saying that from a large cultural perspective we may be entering a new nomadism. I think the Internet is an example of this, where we can travel the world of places, ideas, time—most everything—in an “instant”. Perhaps the greatest danger is in not taking time to dwell in anything, but rushing off to “the next” as quickly as we arrived. We may indeed sacrifice what Keats called negative capability, when one “is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason”. It is not possible to dwell in these geographies Keats refers to if time loses “duration” in our experience. Yet, even if one is able to stay in such spaces for a time, there too we find a kind of nomadic wanderlust at work, for in that space, the portals of imagination, like gateways, open to a “new world”, one opens to exploration in ways that are only hinted at by what we have mentioned so far in these dialogues, and even more so by that to which we have not yet spoken. Dreams, as I have tried to make clear, are “calling” us to “explore the future”, to enter into the rhizomic womb and to participate in the birth of what is to come. In this sense, dreams are nomadic prods, urging us on. </p>

<p>As I was mulling this over, I fell into a liminal state in which I was traveling with a group of prehistoric figures— perhaps Neanderthals—producing a frisson of uncertainty as to what I was in this context. I could not tell, knowing only that I “understood” what was being said and that we were traveling to a “council of dreamers”, as the leader explained. </p>

<p>As I came out of this imaginal state, I felt that this was one of those “hints” that we have not yet explored, that has that strange quality of a root in long lost history and yet speaking to “the future” in some way not quite explicable. So, Paco, what does the image of a “council of dreamers” from prehistoric time conjure up in you?</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> As usual, your words and images have the effect of a blacksmith’s hammer on the anvil of my mind, and associations go flying in all directions, like sparks from red-hot iron. I hope I can do partial justice to at least some of those sparks as I chase them hither and yon. </p>

<p>You point out a dichotomy between two levels of the “new nomadism”. On one side, there is a fruitful seeking after new and even old but always lively ways of seeing; and on the other, a restless but sterile gaze upon mere objects. The first strikes forth in revolutionary ways, while the second turns in grooves of deadly sameness. </p>

<p>Why should we use the term “nomadism” to describe both phenomena? Partly, I think, it is a result of how undeveloped our language is in describing the subtleties of psychological experience. We have become so accustomed to what Blake decried as “Newton’s single vision”, that we forget there are two ways of seeing— merely looking at vs. truly seeing. When we only look at something, all subjective awareness resides within us. But when we truly see something, what we see addresses us as a living subject in its own right. Rilke recognized this phenomenon in his poem “Archaic Torso of Apollo”. At the end of the poem, the marble torso “still suffused with brilliance from inside, like a lamp” spoke to Rilke, in effect, and said: “...there is no place that does not see you. You must change your life”. </p>

<p>Of these two modern nomadisms, I know that you seek what we might call the “higher”, or revolutionary, nomadism. That is why you allowed yourself to dwell in the negative capability long enough to drop into that timeless reverie in which you walked with a band of Neanderthal hunters, all on your way to a “council of dreamers”. Had you hewn only to the mark of the lower nomadism, you would probably be up to your ears in electrodes, standard deviations and control groups. As it is, you have hewn to the mark of your <em>own experience</em>. </p>

<p>I accepted your challenge to respond to the “council of dreamers” image. Consigning myself to negative capability, I dropped into my own reverie. <em>I saw myself born along on the wings of a large heron, as if I was riding on its back. The heron and I flew toward the Neanderthal band and on to its “council of dreamers” When we arrived, I saw—or felt—that the dreamers formed a circle, the only configuration that made any sense. As I tried to feel my way into the goal of their council, the aim of their meeting, I was surprised to find that what they sought was... the future!</em> This was so startling to me that, at that point, the vision ended.</p>

<p>However brief and evanescent it was, this imaginal experience has given me much to contemplate. How ironic that, in our efforts to chart ways into the future, you and I both have fallen back on styles and methods of consciousness thousands of years old, only to discover that our Neanderthal counterpart—at least insofar as my imagination could see them— were seeking a pathway into the future, as if they sought to meet us halfway! </p>

<p>Also, I find myself wondering to what extent the heron and I are separate, distinct beings. Whether I say “I flew” or “we flew”, is there a difference? Are we discontinuous phenomena, as the modern outlook would have it, or are the two of us really one, parts of one integral unity? This would be an archaic mode of “thought”. I suspect that mysteries lurk behind these questions, which the modern outlook is ill-suited to answer. I know that imaginal experiences are susceptible to any number of reductive criticisms, as if they were only this, or only that. But years of living with the negative capability required to delve deeply into dreams has long since taught me to proceed in all such exploratory ventures in the provisional spirit of— <em>as if</em>. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Your reference to their seeking us as we seek them reminds me of Robert Sawyer’s wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neanderthal_Parallax">Neanderthal Trilogy</a>: <em>Hominid, Human, Hybrid</em>. Here is one artist who is fictionally pursuing this very territory. Who knows what future “hybrid” consciousness might develop if we recovered the deep roots of “knowing” that these people had? Aren’t we seeing a version of this in modern science when—freed from the confines of that Newtonian single-mindedness— we are freed to recover the wisdom of earlier traditions? Do we not see something of this in Avatar, James Cameron’s vision of the hybrid possibilities of human and alien? </p>

<p>This “going back”, in what ever manner, is an essential move in “going forward”. It characterizes the point of the new nomadism. Modern humans, for all our overall advancement, can hardly be described as fully “at home”. Half the world is fighting over “homeland”, and we all are witness to the ecological warnings that picture our earthly home in grave danger. So the new nomadism appears in many forms from impulses to “find meaning” (as old institutions crumble), to exploring dreams, imagination, and the far reaches of mental states, to our incessant nomadic “browsing” the internet. </p>

<p>If we focus on the word itself, <em>nomad</em>, we can see how this works. Nomads have no fixed home as they are constantly “seeking” food, water, shelter. The word came from the Greek <em>nomos</em>, from the Indo-European root <em>nem-</em> containing the fundamental image of “wandering”. But wandering is not “lost”. It is the stark “lostness” of the modern, post-modern, and contemporary conditions that claim there is no meaning, that dreams are random, imagination is illusion, and there is only now. True wandering is, ironically, a dwelling in the unknown of the future, the uncertainty of “next”, and moreover a kind of “appetite” for what Keats called the “Pentralium of Mystery”. Keats captured this sense in his “negative capability”, as did Rilke in his line, “There is no place to bide”. (Yes, it’s “bide” as in to bide one’s time, to wait, to dwell.) </p>

<p>If we focus on the etymology of the word “future”, it’s prehistory, we find the root <em>bleu-</em>, meaning “to be”, “to dwell”, “to grow”. In Greek this came to be the word <em>phulon</em> which referred to the “tribe that dwells together”. Of course, the future is “what is to be”, where we <em>will</em> dwell, that place we will “grow into” together. I love how “looking back” into a word’s roots, reveals so much. And this is a rhizomic layer each of us carries whether we know it or not. </p>

<p>By “going back” to the prehistory of the word “future”, we can gather up some intriguing images that begin to give more “body” to the word. I’m sure that “going back” into earlier consciousness would similarly give birth to experiences that would likewise give body to our wanderings in prehistory. I believe it is important, as the word itself conveys, that we do this together. In this regard I’ve been wondering whether the “social networking” craze (Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc.) is perhaps a step in this direction of non-hierarchical collective effort. </p>

<p>So how do we do this... <em>new community</em>? I think that most of us have an immediate problem with this because our consciousness is so filled with intention (or shoulds, oughts, can’ts, etc.) we get stopped from doing anything at all in this direction. So first, I believe, <em>dropping</em> intention as fully as possible is one way to dwell and wander in unintentional space. This cutting the moorings to our sense of “us”, becomes the potential for our experiencing something “other”. Being nomadic, after all, means leaving what we know and moving on into an unknown “something else”. This is the state I think we are talking about in these dialogues. Listen to how Lorca expresses this: </p>

<h3>Casida of the Rose</h3>

<pre>

The rose 

was not searching for the sunrise: 

almost eternal on its branch, 

it was searching for something else 



The rose was not searching for 

darkness or science 

borderline of flesh and dream, 

it was searching for something else.



The rose 

was not searching for the rose 

motionless in the sky 

it was searching for something else 

</pre>

<p>One of the ways I do this searching is through what I call “accidental” gesture. A specific example is to take coffee and a large sheet of soft absorbent paper and spill, splash, throw, drip, drop, smear, etc., without any “intention” to “make something” specific. After the sheet dries, I come back to it and begin not to “merely look”, but to “truly see” as you call it. What has been given form (“birthed”) in these accidental gestures? Here I include an image that was “found” in one such effort before we reached this point in our dialogue. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf5-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Dark leaf-like shape" style="width: 300px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p>This is from a collection of such found images with accompanying “word gestures” I am calling, <em>Foundlings At Large</em>. </p>

<p>We can talk about what I or anyone else might “project” into the “accidental image” as bringing out some aspect of our subjective state. I have no problem with this idea unless it is used as an “explanation” for what one sees. This is the single mindedness you referred to as Newtonian. But if we follow Goethe’s notions, and Rilke’s admonitions, and Keats’ insights, then we deepen into the experience, through a participation with what is there. What is important, crucial and so often missed, is being penetrated by the image, a genuine intimacy with the otherness of the image, and decidedly not “only” or “just” a solipsistic relationship with oneself.</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> “To be penetrated by the image, a genuine intimacy with the otherness of the image”. What a radical concept, Russ! This is exactly what we have spent centuries protecting ourselves against, the autonomous imagination, which came to be seen as a threat to our project of controlling nature (or, as Francis Bacon put it, “vexing” nature) in order to force her to yield not only her secrets, but her bounty, far beyond what she spontaneously gives us of her own accord. And so we seek to “conquer” and “dominate” not only the natural world but our own inner lives as well, as if we were at war both with ourselves and the world. What a tremendous inner divisiveness besets us. And, far from quelling the disturbance, we fan the flames and set one another’s teeth on edge. </p>

<p>But like Lorca and the rose, you are calling for “something else”. Instead of warfare, conquest and dominion, you evoke something erotic, a passionate yielding to the beloved, allowing oneself to be penetrated by the image and its otherness. This amounts to a prescription for a massive healing process, a virtual restoration of our inherent religious sensibility, our natural birthright. That’s why Sawyer’s reflections on the Neanderthals ring true. He seems to be focusing on inherent, evolutionary gifts that we, throughout our centuries and millennia of hubris, have lost track of. Jung used to cite what he called a “classical etymology” of the term religion: “a careful consideration of the effects emanating from the unconscious”. Your phrase of allowing oneself to be “penetrated by the image” says the same thing, in language favored by artists. </p>

<p>Your “accidental gestures”, those spilled-coffee paintings, images seen in driftwood, and so forth, show to what extent we are surrounded by clues and hints of that “other world”. I once wrote: “The beaches of our sleep are studded with the note-stuffed bottles of dreams”. Well, as you show, it really takes very little to shift from one reality to another, just that twist of attitude, away from hard-driving intention toward the moment of uncertainty, dwelling there, paying attention to what appears, like taking a breath, and pausing. This is how epiphanies happen: just that momentary pause, and staying with it. It’s amazing, when you think about it, how close the boundary is between apocalyptic destruction and creative renewal. But it does require a subtle shift in individual awareness to take place. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> I’m glad you mentioned <em>“as if”</em>. I don’t think this notion has penetrated deeply enough. It was Benthem who wrote his “theory of fictions”, and then Vaihinger, who wrote his “fictionalism”, and the psychoanalyst Adler, who wrote of “fictions as a final goal”. Strangely, Jung does not refer to Vaihinger, though James Hillman has righted this by combining the streams of Vaihinger and Adler with his own contributions resulting in his “healing fictions”. In one way or another, these efforts are working away from the literalism of so-called “reality”, and putting forth a valuation of the fruitfulness of the image and of the imagination. This is the difference between “merely looking” and “truly seeing” you referred to earlier. “Fiction”, in whatever form, is a way of “wandering” and “dwelling” and as such, is a means of “revelation” that so-called reality and the real world does <em>not</em> yield. </p>

<p>The fiction of dreams is a prime example. When “reduced” only to reality concerns, they will lose their deepest value to us. But a dream leading us into the future: there is its deepest concern. You saw this in your own imaginal experience of the “council of dreamers”. Rilke certainly had something like this in mind when he says, “You must give birth to your images. They are the future waiting to be born. Fear not the strangeness you feel. The future must enter you long before it happens. Just wait for the birth, for the hour of the new clarity”. </p>

<p>Here is an example of future enterings from another angle. Earlier in this dialogue, you said that my images had the effect of “a blacksmith’s hammer on the anvil of your mind”. Even though I cannot really “claim” the images as “mine” in any proprietary sense, I loved your expression. I knew that your image of the hammer and anvil and the blacksmith “hit” me. It was some time later, in the shower one evening, that I heard a voice announce with clarity: “hope is the anvil of evil”. </p>

<p>This is what I call a “presentational” experience. By this I mean that if one begins to “truly listen” to what one “hears” (similar to what you referred to as truly seeing as distinct from merely seeing), then the effort to “reduce” this experience disappears in favor of what I think of as “gleanings”. I wrote of this a long while ago in a paper called, <em>“Mary’s Dog Is An Ear Mother”</em>, which came from the voice of a hospitalized schizophrenic patient. I illustrated there what can happen when one truly listens to “the voices of psychosis”. Very often, these presentational experiences will find their way into poetic expression, not because one is or tries to “be” a poet, but because that is the form in which the listening goes. For example, this is what happened in response to hearing that line in the shower. </p>

<h3>Evil’s Anvil</h3>

<pre>

The voice whispered 

words not echoing 

off the shower walls not 

drowning in the pulsing flow 

but repeating as if mimicking 

the alarm this morning in 

not quite sing-song 

but something like 



    Hope is evil’s anvil... 

    Hope is evil’s anvil... 

    Hope is evil’s anvil... 



until I echoed aloud 

asking the questions 

What then is evil’s <i>hammer</i>? 

What then is being <i>forged</i>? 

Who then is <i>smithing</i>? 



Then I thought 

if all attention is fixed 

on evils loosed from 

Pandora’s jar, and only Hope 

remaining becomes evil’s anvil 

What <i>then</i>? 



Hesiod does not tell, nor 

anyone else; everyone is silent. 

But now I can hear the clanging 

metals as they collide in there. 

</pre>

<p>I invite anyone to respond to the questions posed. I wrote out these lines here not as a poem, and not as a poet, but as a “witness”, to illustrate the kind of poetic response that “flows” from the reverie on the line in the shower. I was not “making this up” so much as writing it out as I “heard” it— although it was not so much speech I heard as the “sound” of words “gushing forth”. I don’t expect this to make much sense; in fact, I’m not trying to make sense at all, but simply to “tell” in that sense I’ve written about elsewhere: eros means telling. Now I have to admit that I have in the past studied a good bit of Hesiodian scholarship and am aware of the myriad interpretations of Pandora’s actions and the meaning of Hope’s remaining. But I was not thinking any of that as these lines poured forth. In fact these mages would be a rather new approach to the underlying questions the myth propounds. I don’t want to go there, as the main point is to illustrate the “spark” and its effect that your words evoked in me, and became, in Rilke’s sense, a place to bide.</p>

<p><em>This is the sixth in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Over the course of our dialogue, one psychological factor has been implicit from the beginning. We have used it liberally and described its operations, but have not yet brought it front and center. That is the factor of <em>intuition</em>. Taken in the sense of “instinctive knowing”, or—as Jung once described it—“perception by way of the unconscious”, I believe it deserves at least a mention in our conversation. </p>

<p>I have often thought—intuited, rather—that intuition is one of the oldest functions of the human psyche, one that we share with our animal brethren. I would even be comfortable placing intuition in the context of <em>animal knowing</em>. As a mysterious, archaic function, intuition has suffered a certain depreciation under the hegemony of the modern demand for rational thinking. With rigorous thinking we build the systems that control the world. Intuition, in contrast, is not so systematic. Since it governs the elusive flow of information that approaches consciousness from the side of the unconscious, it is not so readily controlled or manipulated as the products of systematic thought. </p>

<p>Intuition is unruly. Sometimes it hits the bull’s-eye, sometimes it is way off the mark. What we tend to forget is that intuition is a skill which requires development, perhaps in the same way that Zen archery requires “practice”—trying, yet not trying. I believe intuition exists as a potential aptitude in every human being. But unless it is valued and attended to— honed like a blade, we might say—it is liable to remain dull and ineffective. Thinking, in contrast, is inculcated in students from an early age. We are generally taught how to think, but not how to intuit. To a considerable extent, then, intuition ends up being a solitary craft, cultivated by the few. </p>

<p>And here’s the paradox: Even as I’m calling for more conscious development of intuition, I recognize that a widened popularity could be the death knell of the very thing I seek. You can imagine the fate of intuition in the hands of “experts” — research budgets, marketing campaigns, amazing new breakthroughs, etc. </p>

<p>As you have pointed out, Russ, we already seek to “commodify” the psyche—images, emotions, dreams. In this context, intuition is just another frontier to be conquered, another market to be developed, another “taste” to be acquired. </p>

<p>But one of the values of intuition is precisely that it violates the pathways of convention. It doesn’t behave. And its ultimate mysteriousness brings us close to a recognition of the Otherness within ourselves and beyond. This attitude—the respect for soulfulness in oneself, in one’s fellow creatures, in nature, in the cosmos, even—is probably more deeply engraved in us, more fundamental to our human being, than the lust for limitless exploitation. </p>

<p>Let me emphasize: I’m not saying a wide-spread cultivation of intuition will redeem the world. But I am suggesting this: <em>Any redemptive forces that reach consciousness will come to us by way of the unconscious.</em> And if we are to discriminate among the counter-tendencies presently stirring in the human psyche—in order to discern the redemptive, healing ones—we will need the help of well-honed intuition, and plenty of it. </p>

<p>Thus we might have a chance of pruning away some of the deadwood that overburdens us, and doing the difficult work of locating and feeding the healthy roots. But we must go to that root-level if we are to save the tree. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> One-way to go to the “roots of the tree” is to go literally to the roots of the words we use. Take “intuition” for example. It’s composed of two elements in- and -tuition. As is often the case when we begin to do this we are thrown a bit off guard. Even though it’s in plain sight, when was the last time you thought of “tuition” in relation to “intuition”? What does tuition have to do with this important function? Is there a “cost” we must pay? And probably no one “remembers” the meaning of tuition as “guardianship”. We can understand this better if we dig further into the roots of “tuition” where we soon come upon the elemental root, <strong>-teu</strong>. This root means “to look at”, “watch”, and “protect”. Our English words tuition, tutelage, tutor and intuition come from this root. You can see here in the words blossoming from this root something of the idea of learning. You talk about intuition being attended to and you can see that in the very root of the word itself. </p>

<p>Now how do we do this? </p>

<p>What would it mean to be under the tutelage of intuition—intuition as tutor? I think what this means is that the only way to develop intuition in the sense you describe is to pay attention to and be taught by intuition. You speak of intuition being a “solitary craft”. I was struck by your phrase and immediately noted the sense of craft as art, the sense of craftiness as cunning, and the image of craft as a vessel. Alongside this came the idea that dreams and intuition often have the same fate— that is to be ignored and neglected and devalued. This triggered an avalanche of peculiar notions: the cunning of dreams, the art of dreams, the craft of dreams, dreams as vessel. Then came the spontaneous image of being on the ocean in a small craft. This image “presented” itself and in that sense was like an intuition or dream. So, I became “student” to this image and put myself under its tutelage, to let the image tutor me. I think you can see right away that as soon as we try to “grasp” the image and try to “understand it” and try to “interpret it” we step away from that sense of image (dream or intuition) <em>as tutor</em>. </p>

<p>So instead of any of that, I watched and listened and “paid attention” to what the image would “say”. I was suddenly struck by an “awareness” of the ocean’s “surface” all about me. It was more than that simultaneously, there was an awareness of the vast “underneath”. That was the “language” that was presented. It’s hard to say what the next thing was that happened but it amounted to the idea or awareness that I was traveling on “the face of the underneath”. I was startled by “hearing” these words, if hearing it was. When a dream or intuition comes to the “surface” we are staring, as it were, into the “face of the underneath”. We are face to face with something “other”. Some of these things that surface will of course come from “just beneath”, while others will come from vast depths and present us with utter strangeness, just as happens when we see creatures from the deep ocean that are nearly incomprehensible. It’s in that “face to face” where we would be better off to think of ourselves not as masters but as students in need of tutoring. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> I love your notion of being “under the tutelage of intuition”, of being “tutored by the image”. Sounds like a simple idea, doesn’t it? But in fact it’s quite profound. And in the context of contemporary orthodoxy, i.e., the modern mind-set, I would even say it’s revolutionary. </p>

<p>There is still a widespread commitment to hard-headed realism, to debunking “myths”, to a strict avoidance of fanciful thinking. In such a climate, to become a follower of intuition and the spontaneities of the imagination, is to subvert the conventional power attitudes that have been so highly prized. In 1875, the English poet William Henley was able to write heroically: “I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul”. In the context of those times, the words expressed a sentiment appropriate to the British Empire, perhaps. But your vision expresses a different sentiment, where “mastery” has little to do with mastery over one’s soul; it is rather a question of becoming a master in service to the soul. </p>

<p>One crucial detail: Such service, in order to be genuine, must be willing to proceed in the face of the unknown. This is what you sought, of course, in your etymological reverie. What began with a consideration of the word “intuition”, ended with your floating over the face of the “vast underneath”. Such a word-voyage into imaginal waters is in itself a colorful example of what Keats meant by “Negative Capability”. </p>

<p>Staying with poetic ambiguities, opening to dreams, seeing the world as a subject with a voice, attending to synchronicities, following intuition: In these and many other ways we unwind at least some of the “mental sclerosis”, the hardened attitudes with which we have become afflicted over the past few centuries—in heart, mind and imagination. A short poem by E. E. Cummings speaks to the restorative attitude you demonstrate in your work-play with words: </p>

<pre>

<i>Audience to poet: “You know what you’re doing, don’t you?”</i>

<i>Poet to audience: “Excuse me, I do what I’m knowing”.</i> 

</pre>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> One can ask why this is so difficult. Is it because we have lost the natural playfulness of childhood? We don’t teach children to imagine or even to learn that most complex thing we call language. Children are naturally under the tutelage of intuition and imagination and dreams —until we teach them otherwise. </p>

<p>In our education system we mainly unlearn our children from some of the most crucial things of all. This is a terrible misfortune and I only hope it can be remedied before all semblance of connection to the rhizome we come with is washed away. I want to be optimistic. But in relation to this the words of that old Peter Yarrow song, “Greenwood” that Peter, Paul and Mary used to sing, keep haunting me: </p>

<pre>

<i>If we don’t stop there’ll come a time when women</i>

<i>With barren wombs will bitterly rejoice</i>

<i>With breasts that dry and never fill with promise</i> 

<i>Gladly they’ll not suckle one more life</i> 

<i>Is this then the whimper and the ending?</i> 

<i>The impotence of people raised on fear</i> 

<i>A fear that blinds the sense of common oneness</i> 

<i>Common love and life or death are here</i> 

<i>If we do these things in the greenwood. What will happen in the dry?</i> 

</pre>

<p>It was Nietzsche I think who put his finger on the key idea: That for most people, <em>any</em> explanation is better than none. This drive, he said, is conditioned and excited by fear. It is that fear in one version or another, the fear of the unknown, of uncertainty, of ambiguity, all those things young Keats was referring to in his notion of negative capability: that fear is at the root that leads us astray from the roots we need. In 1933, a time not unlike our own, Franklin Roosevelt said, “...the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”. He was referring to the economic times, but the idea is much more pervasive and is not limited to bad times. We are equally misled by the fear of the unknown, really the fear of the future, at all times—it is just that sometimes we don’t notice it as much but its cost is always dear. That question, “What will happen in the dry”, is at the root of your concern for the tree you spoke of earlier. I fear the tree is us. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Yes, it’s true: The tree is us. And I like the way you constructed that sentence, placing the tree in first position, then us, as if to say: “We grow out of the tree”. The Tree symbolizes a fundamental, a priori condition of our lives, which is why it played a central role in the Garden of Eden story, that fantasy of mythic origins. But the image of the sacred tree was already ancient by the time the Book of Genesis was written, having figured prominently on many Mesopotamian cylinder seals—stone or fired-clay cylinders with figures carefully carved into them.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf6-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Seal" style="width: 200px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><i>Mesopotamian cylinder seal, ca. 2200 B.C.E., shows a couple facing a sacred tree, reaching for fruit, flanked by two serpents.</i></div> 

<p>When rolled onto a slab of fresh clay, the cylinder left impressions of the carved figures—often showing the goddess surrounded by trees and animals. We didn’t exactly lose those mythic images when the Bible was written, but we did alter the valence of the images themselves and what they refer to, downgrading and demonizing the earthy goddess and natural life—the old values—in favor of a distant sky god and a more mental, etherealized conception of spirit and divinity. </p>

<p>The examples you cite above underscore the importance of your image of the rhizome, a mysterious, underlying structure and process— as much psyche as physis, for all we know—in whose life we all participate, and out of which we grow. Rhizome, root and tree, of course, are related symbolic metaphors. If, out of fear, we choke off the life-sustaining waters from our own depths, or sterilize the nutrients of the inner soil, what becomes of life? It dries. And if conditions don’t change, sooner or later it dies. Bright sun and air alone do not avail. The moist darkness is just as important as the dry light. </p>

<p>Peter Yarrow’s unflinching song, “Greenwood”, was haunting indeed. The message was clear: “If we don’t stop, we’ll be sorry”. It reminds me of the importance of facing the facts. With all the news of current and impending crises today—especially in our relations to the natural environment— many people find the temptation to look away overpowering. They would “rather not think about it”. Jung’s references to conscious sacrifice, which implies a willingness not to shrink from unpleasant facts and images, certainly apply here. Any therapy patient facing the “hot bath” of analysis knows what this feels like. The ego would prefer to sail untroubled over fearsome waters, but the deeper life—the vast underneath — calls us out of our complacency. Robert Jay Lifton spoke of the difficulty of facing the “intolerable image”—referring to the implications and consequences of nuclear weapons. A collective unwillingness to face the intolerable image results in what he calls widespread “psychic numbing”. How are we to deal with the fear that hampers us if we are psychically and emotionally numb? </p>

<p>Interesting that you placed “the children” and fear-riddled adults in the same context. If children are “naturally under the tutelage of intuition, imagination and dreams”— until we drum it out of them—their example provides one antidote for the deeply desiccating fearfulness that infects our time. Speaking of children, novelist Dorothy L. Sayers wrote an interesting variation on the Biblical saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Except ye become as little children, except you can wake on your fiftieth birthday with the same forward-looking excitement and interest in life that you enjoyed when you were five, ye cannot enter the kingdom of God. One must not only die daily, but every day we must be born again.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>She could have said, “Except ye live with an awareness of the rhizome”. </p>

<p>Intuition easily connects these four imaginal realms—the Biblical “Kingdom of God”, your modern metaphor of the “rhizome”, the image of “little children” and the primordial symbol of “the Tree”. Not that anything is “explained” by such intuitive connections—rather, something “other” in me sees the overlapping parallels in those four ideas. In the psychic depths to which all these imaginal places refer, there is a shifting fluidity that defies final definitions. And yet the imaginal presences that finally rise to consciousness, eventually to inform a culture, “want” to be fixed... for a while at least, the way a bronze caster’s metal “wants” to be melted and poured into new molds, worked and finished. Then at some point, the metal “wants” to be melted down all over again to suit the needs of a different age. Most Greek bronzes were melted down for other uses by the Romans; and a wedding ring today might contain at least a few molecules of Egyptian or Inca gold. </p>

<p>One reason for the underlying fear you refer to may be the fact that we are so deeply in need of transformation, a new dispensation. We need to fill our well-bucket to the brim with fresh images by means of which we can meet the future. In fact, the future comes to us in the form of images, since it has not yet assumed tangible shape. The more tightly and hysterically people cling to worn-out images out of fear, the more they block the future. Dreams of blocked plumbing might echo this condition. </p>

<p>I am aware that a discerning balance between old and new is required. In one sense, the future has to be chosen, just as one has to choose which old forms get tossed into the crucible for melting—transformation— and which ones get salvaged, modified or restored. It’s a harrowing enough process when carried out on an individual level. How much more harrowing it is, then, when it occurs on a global scale! </p>

<p>We are faced with troubling, intolerable, melancholy-inducing images on all sides, to be sure. Yet there’s a strange consolation in facing them, for, as a French philosopher once said, “Melancholy can open a secret door to the sublime”. </p>

<p>Throughout our dialogue you have been demonstrating Keats’ Negative Capability, as a way to access “the rhizome”. This experience may be simple to undertake, but it is not necessarily cheap, given the context of our time. It requires a steep tuition payment, if only in the form of the courage required to leave the safe decks and cabins of the ocean liner that is our collective vessel. One has to lower oneself, step into the small, tender craft rocking on the deep waters, and then peer into the depths. There’s no telling what will rise to the surface to meet one’s gaze. But frankly, I’m more afraid of the consequences of not looking into the depths, than I am of the images that might come to light. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> To paraphrase Thorton Wilder, “there’s a bridge between the known and the unknown, and that bridge is curiosity”. Far too often, for far too many, for far too long, the bridge is fear. This fear will not “stop” the future, of course, but it will block that first of Leonardo Da Vinci’s life principles: curiosità. For Da Vinci this meant “seeking the truth”. When fear leads and dominates, truth-seeking is a casualty, and we become as well, victims of the failure of truth-telling at all levels. Engines of power, of whatever stripe—political, corporate, religious, institutional, or individual— count on this, and organize their structures and machinations to subvert curiosity, and deflect fear into hope. </p>

<p>Why is this? </p>

<p>I believe it is because curiosity inevitably leads to action, while hope leads to paralysis. (Recall Yarrow’s line, The impotence of people raised on fear.) Moreover, curiosity sparks the imagination, while hope tends to hunger after states already known. Etymologically, curiosity is rooted in care and cure; hope is rooted in hollow. For these reasons, I am no fan of the politics of hope, nor the attitude toward dreams as agents of fulfilling wishes. The linking of “hopes and dreams” keeps us bound only to what we know rather in the manner of Alice’s sister. What is needed is the spirit of Alice herself as she stepped through into the looking-glass world. To me, dreams and imagination and the art that flows from these sources, are not agents of hope, but agents of change, bearing hints and intimations of the future, of things we do not already know, but intuitively desire.</p>

<p><em>This is the seventh in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Russell:</strong> Last time, you brought up intuition as a focus. Another aspect to bring front and center is time. Our ordinary sense of time, our sense of linear time, the straight arrow of time, the flowing in one direction of time, the succession of events in time—all these concepts of time serve the intentionality of the ego, its purposes, plans and its sense of future. In relation to time in this sense we can measure “it” with high precision. We are on solid ground. </p>

<p>Notice, however, that intuition, dreams, imagination, serendipity, synchronicity, and art are “different” in relation to time. What is this difference? In a word: fluidity. In these exper-iences, time is more like the ocean. There is no singular direction; more like all directions. Two qualities stand out to me: a sense of “being carried” and a sense of “immersion”. Time loses its solidity. </p>

<p>When Alice moves through the mirror (that has become “like a bright silvery mist”) into looking-glass world, the mantel’s clock has the face of a little old man grinning at her. This announces that time is going to be different in looking glass world. And, when time is different, everything is going to be different. Everything is going to go all <em>jabberwocky</em>. Of course this is “nonsense” to the rational mind and so develops the habit of rejecting everything that does not “fit”, a high value of Alice’s sister. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krdbf7-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Two birds, perhaps representing the authors" style="width: 300px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<p><div style="text-align: center;"><i>“Time” by Cydney Hayes. 2000. 16”x20</i></p>

<p>But then how much more “nonsensical” is it to read the latest <em>Scientific American</em> on the topic entitled, “Does Time Exist?” Can’t you just see the Red Queen running rampant shouting, “There is no time, there is no time”. One thing we know about these fluid encounters with time in dreams and imagination and art is what Alice noticed when she read the poem <em>Jabberwocky</em>: “Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don’t exactly know what they are!” It’s that <em>not</em>-knowing that is so hard. As we’ve noted several times in our dialogue it is staying with this Keatsian notknowing and letting it lead that is so hard for our modern consciousness to do. Instead of “making time” to follow the lead of not-knowing, we fill up time with information, which is then rapidly replaced by newer information— and there is an ocean of new information, a tsu-nami coming from every direction. Why is it that whatever is happening via the gadgets we are hooking our brains to is felt to be more crucial than what is happening in the jabberwocky world of our dreams, intuitions, imagination? Instead of “taking time” with these things (and the art and story that become their manifestation), our culture seems intent instead on “filling time” with what Joseph Gold calls “endless distraction”, this endless flow of information. This seems to me some form of <em>entrainment</em>, as if we are all in one way or another being gathered, herded, captured. </p>

<p>It takes time to be engaged with the “story” mind that underlies all “nonsense” (read fiction). It takes time to become <em>dis-engaged</em> from the seductive pull of “distractions”. Whether writing stories, reading stories, dreaming stories, being drawn into the stories of imagination, the stories that birth art, the stories that open up to us in serendipitous and synchronistic happenings, it takes time to dwell with these things and to nourish our mind with them, to become bathed in this sense of time. </p>

<p>I agree with Gold when he says that our brains and our health are being endangered by this process. The consequences are portentous and there seems precious little awareness of this. </p>

<p><strong>Paco:</strong> Fascinating reflections, Russ. It’s true: We seem to be as little aware of time as fish must be of the water in which they swim. The uses and abuses of time to which we have become so dangerously habituated, affect everything we say, think, feel and do. We take it so much for granted that we can scarcely see the damage we are incurring and inflicting on ourselves and others. </p>

<p>Lewis Mumford points to the use of clocks in the ordering of daily chores and worship during the monastic period, citing this development as the earliest foundation of the industrial revolution, well before the power looms of the late 1700s. For many centuries we have been slicing up the otherwise unbroken fluidity of time— Henri Bergson’s <em>durée</em> or duration— until it becomes, along with the objectification of nature via science, a commodity to be used, exploited and priced. In contrast, Bergson emphasized the importance of intuition, of immediate experience, of the <em>élan vital</em>—all related, perhaps, to the fluidity you’re talking about. I imagine he would have been quite at home with your “ocean” of time. </p>

<p>I see the abuse of time as an abuse of the soul. How much of our modern alienation derives from this denial of the primordial experience of unbroken continuity? And similarly, how much of what has been called the tragedy of the commons, our trashing of the environment, derives from this same abuse? For, to a degree we may not expect, we treat nature as we treat ourselves. </p>

<p>When I recall the Bolivian riots ten years ago over <em>who owns the rain</em>— the people or the corporations—I am reminded of this question of time. If people can be dispossessed of the water that falls from the sky, can they also be dispossessed of time? Apparently so. But in the case of the water riots, there was a public outcry. Will we ever see <em>time riots</em>? I don’t know, but an active resistance would not be a bad idea. Who knows? We may hear a rally cry some day: “Throw off the shackles! Slow down! Take your time!” </p>

<p>As you say, we are being gathered, herded and captured, until most of us are time—stressed or time—deprived. It is as if time—once our common possession and treasure—is being stolen from us. But we can “steal back” time from our thieving culture, by various methods of time dilation. For example, your practice of stopping work long enough to spill coffee on drawing paper to see what results, or to examine books accidentally knocked off a library shelf, you are being dilatory with your allotted fragments of time, resisting those endlessly ticking seconds like some biblical Joshua calling for the sun to stand still. </p>

<p>And really, anyone who bothers to remember a dream, to write it down, to draw the dream, to carry it through the day, is participating in this “retro—fitting” of time, the re—conversion of <em>le temps perdu</em> into <em>la durée</em>. But I’d like to hear more about what you are calling the “story” mind. I suspect there’s a great deal implicit in that simple phrase.</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Articulating “story” mind begins with sleep. Sleep first appears in primitive life forms. From the level of worms on up the evolutionary scale, sleep becomes ever more definite and complex. While the basic questions concerning the “why” of sleep are not fully answered, we know that it is necessary for higher animals to “leave” the constant and demanding flow of “waking” experience—what we call the “real” world. Why do we need to leave the waking world? For one thing, it exhausts basic bodily processes—particularly those over which we have no control. Sleep restores these functions and is essential for health and well being. Sleep is also the “theater” in which animals dream. If human experience is any guide, a major feature of dreams is that they are stories in pictures. Not all dreams are pictures to be sure, but the visual mode is dominant. The similarity to “movies” is striking. But more than pictures. In dreams, whether bare fragments or full—fledged drama, all compelling aspects of narrative are present: characters (including versions of ourselves) undergoing conflict leading to actions and potential resolutions. This is what I call the story mind. We sleep not only for restoration of the body’s structures and functions; we sleep in order to dream, in order to experience and participate in story mind. Research now shows that dreaming is not just “ephemera”, not just “random images”, but shows just how necessary dreaming is to our health and well—being. But note how we must “leave” ordinary time and the flow of events in order to participate and be fully engaged in story mind. This time change is true whether we are dreaming, reading a novel, watching a film, or expressing images in art, writing, or other forms. [See interview with Pamela Hayes, this issue, in <em>Dreams in the News</em>.] </p>

<p>In contemporary life, in the pursuit of our waking life, we short change sleep and dreams. I’m convinced this is not only a losing exchange, but one that is disastrous for our overall health and well-being. The modern pressures of life and work are making us sick. If we take medications in order to sleep, almost all of these will deprive of us dreams, or the memory of dreams. If we try to escape our dreams by whatever means, even if they be nightmares, or by shouting claims that dreams are “nonsense”, we are deluding ourselves to our peril. And what is in common with the modern plague of work and ever increasing demands of ”being on-line” is that we lose contact with necessary narrative, with story mind. If we go into therapy, and our story mind gets translated via interpretation into “theory” mind, or the latest version of a consumer six-session “check list”, this amounts to reading critiques of <em>Moby Dick</em>, rather than <em>Moby Dick</em>; reading reviews of Inception, rather than seeing the film; talking about your dream, rather than painting the images that are chasing you or writing it out as a scene from your story mind. Being in contact with story mind takes time. Most everything our cultural engines are pulling us into, goes against this and “consumes” ever more precious time. This is why we are forced into “stealing” time if we are to gain any traction from the modern version of Metropolis that is gathering, herding, capturing us. The problem is not that we do not have enough time for the ever increasing demands of waking life. That is the great delusion. The problem is that we do not have enough time for sleep and for story mind. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> The Zen master calls the monks together and says, “There are many urgent tasks facing us, and little time. Therefore, we must slow down”. Like all good stories, that one deserves repeating, especially since it carries a profound truth. In the middle ages we used to say <em>Omni festinatio parte diaboli est</em>. All haste is of the devil. It was true then, it’s true now. How precarious must our psychic health be today when the symptomatic, timestarved condition even penetrates our sleep, in the form of “anxiety dreams” in which we rush to catch an airplane or take a test? The dreamer tries to sleep in order to enter the story mind, but instead ends up furiously striving to “measure up” to external standards. <em>Metropolis</em>, with its deranged ten-hour clock, is like the dream of modernity. </p>

<p>It’s intriguing to think of the story mind as beginning with sleep, and sleep extending all the way back to worms. The fact that our planet spins means that virtually every creature, from the very onset of life itself, has been conditioned by alternations of light and dark. No wonder we imagined gods of the night and gods of the day, especially sunrise. I can’t think of any life-form that lives in daylight twenty-four hours a day. These facts feed my suspicion that dreams—and not just sleep—in some mysterious way belong to the evolving biosphere. Everything you are saying about the story mind is all the more important today because we’ve become so unbalanced. And most of our narratives—from the most personal all the way up to the Grand Narrative of humanity—are suffering from the distortions and pre-emptions of marketing campaigns and political manipulations. So in addition to reserving time for the story mind, we also need ways to protect the story mind.</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Whatever protects dreaming, the art impulse, the imagination generally, will protect story mind. But the single most effective protection of story mind is the individual taking this up as a project. Humans are a social species and so herding is natural to our ways of functioning even if what we are being herded into may not be so good for us (not accidental that we spend time browsing, twittering, joining social networks, becoming fans). But protecting story mind is necessarily an individual thing, an individual project, like a writer writing a novel, a painter painting, a dreamer dreaming. Be wary of demands that these activities become “social”. </p>

<p>In thinking about your idea of the need for protecting story mind, I am reminded of Goethe. His work was essentially lost in the flood tide of the Newtonian socialization of science. Only when the quirky “individual” nature of quantum ideas came on the scene, did Goethe become “relevant” again. And I think his work, perhaps even more than Jung’s, certainly more than what Jung’s work has become in its “socialized” aspect, may become a crucial aspect of what you are calling the protection of story mind. </p>

<p>We can explore this further in the next dialogue, but let me mention just this. Goethe’s method requires one to slow down and take time and to engage in developing the fullness of the sensorial imagination. You cannot do this in an instant. You cannot computerize this. You can only engage your own individual mind as the way into this. Only the individual can protect story mind. </p>

<p><em>This is the eighth in a series of excerpts from a dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> At the end of our last dialogue, I referred to Goethe’s “method” and how it embodied taking time and engaging in the fullness of the sensorial imagination. What I was referring to may not be clear, so I think an example is in order. This example comes from something that developed into a second “dialogue” between us... and while this has developed into a kind of “play,” it will serve to illustrate the point. It began as I was mulling Goethe at Tully’s, a Seattle coffee shop I frequent. Here is the excerpt from my journal that day: </p>

<p><strong>October 11, 2010.</strong> <em>At Tully’s, Fourth and Union, where I go to write when I’m in Seattle—for coffee too. Today, mulling Goethe’s admonition to look at what one sees, to find the story there, I see two trucks. One is a FedEx, the other Costco. Looking, it’s Fe x and Co o—the Tully pillars blocking the actual seeing so readily “filled in.” Across the street there is a Sale, but in looking, only Sal is there. Next door there is STERLING BANK, but looking says it’s LING BANK. Key Bank is also across the street; looking reveals only Key. Those pillars again. The UPS truck goes by and when I look at what I see, it’s UP. Brooding on this nest, I wait for a line, a line from the story, perhaps the first line. It comes.</em></p>

<p><em>Sal is a teller at Ling Bank. He does not yet know that Fex and Coo have decided ending it is the key. They have been held up by matters that do not concern us. You may not agree. That’s fine, it is not a requirement. Just wait. You will see. To be continued or not...</em></p>

<p>I sent this to you, Paco, just as an example of what becomes of the “sensorial imagination.” I was startled when you sent me several pages of “continuation,” which began as follows: </p>

<p><em>Sal had come in early today, on account of the big brouhaha with Fex and Coo, the bastards. Fex wanted a pow-wow at Tully’s, just like that. So Sal would have to leave before his shift was over. He couldn’t miss this meeting. What do they mean, “it’s urgent”? It’s going beautifully, just the way Sal had planned. Just a few more days, Sal was thinking, a few more lousy days. Did they screw up in some way? Fex was the impatient one, always the big show up front, but in the end he’s the first one to walk. “Coo’s not so bad, just nervous,” Sal said out loud. The teller next to him looked up and said, “What? You OK, Sal?” “Sure, sure, yeah I’m fine. Just talkin’ to myself.” Gotta watch my step, thought Sal. This place is giving me the creeps. Maybe I’ll get outta here now and grab a coffee at Tully’s before Fex and Coo get there. We gotta straighten this thing out....</em> </p>

<p>I responded in turn and we have now continued this “play” for over 100 pages. What is this? The first thing I’d point out is that the detailing of my “looking” experience sparked something in your imagination. This is what Goethe called <em>“exakte sinnliche Phantasie”</em> (exact sensorial imagination), and what I gave free rein to in my experience at Tully’s. It proved generative in your imaginative response and what has followed from it—none of it “intentional” in any usual sense. My experience that day was unpredictable, unintended and unplanned. If I had stayed with what I “knew was true” (FedEx, Costco, Sale, Sterling Bank, Key Bank, UPS), none of this would have happened. If I had dragged back my “looking” to only what was “really” there, nothing would have come of this. It would have been only a list and a list is not a story until it finds entry into the imagination. This is the fundamental nature of Goethe’s method, and why the detail of what is actually experienced (Fex, Coo’, Sal, Ling Bank, Key, UP) is so crucial. It finds entry immediately into the imagination and this in turn generates an imaginative reply as soon as the <em>Urphänomen</em> (as Goethe called it) is told. This “telling” is an embodiment of eros and this is the nature of its generativity. </p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> When you were at Tully’s that day, mulling over Goethe with coffee, the story that grew out of the experience was surprising indeed, and has been generative for both of us. But as you say, it was only because you took the time to put Goethe’s insight into play, in both the conventional and the ironic sense. You put the insight into play—into action— by acting playfully. You invested a portion of your time into a form of play—hardly the nose-to-the-grindstone work ethic we were both taught. The subsequent burst of writing caught us by surprise. Whether it continues or not will depend on our ability to stay in that playful mode, resisting the pull of the “cultural engines” you mentioned last time. </p>

<p>Your emphasis on the unpredictable, unintended and unplanned is a subtle perception leading to profound connections, seemingly hidden, yet plain as day. They are right in front of our noses, but we don’t see them precisely because we have been trained to seek and value the predictable, the intentional and the planned. We learn to reject what is accidental as messy, dangerous and unreliable. Hence, the modern mindset invariably misses what you saw at Tully’s, and what Goethe saw two hundred years ago. What was the big secret? In a word, to look at what you were seeing. But what a gulf seems to separate the one from the other. </p>

<p>This may seem like a thin distinction, but it’s not. For millennia humans have assiduously observed chance events, accidents, the unexpected, etc., and found in them valuable clues as to the inclinations, the creative movements, of the divine, the gods, the spirits, etc. The word accident derives from the Latin <em>cadere</em>, to fall or die. It is related to chance, cadaver, decay, chute, even recidivism. No wonder there has always been a circle of ritual caution drawn around chance, accidental events. One never knows at what point the predictable human world will be disrupted by the capricious actions of the gods. Today, modernity views the ancients with patronizing contempt or amusement, but at least they had the benefit of a cautionary concept—hubris—with which they could remind themselves of their own natural limits. </p>

<p>Today we presume to have overthrown these limits. In our boldness, we believe that the ancient, superstitious attitude has been thoroughly overturned by the modern objective viewpoint. Or so we think. But in our pride we lose sight of Jung’s <em>enantiodromia</em>— the running toward the opposite—and forget that the more we seek and gain control, the closer we come to losing it. </p>

<p>I love the flamenco verse that expresses this wisdom: </p>

<pre>

Sirva de aviso, 

Sirva de aviso, 

Que a mayor confianza 

Mayor peligro. 



Let it serve as a warning 

Let it serve as a warning 

That at the moment of greatest confidence 

Lies the greatest danger. 

</pre>

<p>In your humble Goethean exercise at Tully’s you opened yourself to the creative, accidental element of chance that suffuses and surrounds our controlled world. No doubt there are many genies in the bottle you opened, not all benevolent. That’s why propitiatory rituals always attended the approach to the creative. Ancient smiths and founders would only melt or forge metal on certain days... and only after ritual sacrifices. To trespass on the creative was not something undertaken lightly. Therefore, Tully’s. Therefore, coffee of a certain roast. Therefore, just the right chair. The pillar positioned just so. The opening of the laptop. The first sip. The looking. The waiting. The writing. The care of attendance upon the unexpected. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> We have titled our dialogue, <em>“Dreams, Bones and the Future”</em>. There is, of course, no “end” to such dialogue. But perhaps, with the advent of “Fex and Coo,” a goal we neither specified, nor planned, nor announced, has been achieved and so it may be time to bring this portion of our dialogue to a close. I can think of no better way to do this than to make reference to Goethe’s experience of meeting himself, that is, a far-into-the-future self. I’m thinking of him riding his horse on the road to Sesenheim, and he “sees” a horse riding toward him, carrying an older Goethe dressed in clothes quite different than he was actually wearing, clothes he did not own. Years later, he is once again riding the road to Sesenheim, and realizes that— without plan or intention—he is wearing the exact clothes he had seen in his vision years earlier. He is now the figure he saw. What I “saw” at Tully’s has become an unplanned, unintended, accidental future. Whether through this Goethean “looking” at what we are seeing when awake, or whether further engaging the images presented to us in the night world of dreams, we are witness to the seeds of the future. </p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Throughout the course of our dialogue we have been trying to straddle a gulf that seems to widen by the day. Our effort might seem comical to some, as our feet get farther apart—picture Laurel and Hardy working as lumberjacks on a log pond, each foot on a different log, the logs drifting farther and farther apart. To others the seriousness of our intent should be evident. </p>

<p>The gulf we’re straddling, of course, is the distance between the primordial, innate gifts of the human imagination, psyche or soul and the kind of imagining that will be required of us in the future. What separates the two is the modern, objective outlook which depreciates imagining, deep seeing, in all but very restricted areas. Goethe, as you have observed, was ahead of his time, and the subsequent development of the scientific method—especially the scientific “attitude”—rendered Goethe’s views on science and knowledge “obsolete.” Only recently are his writings being revived and modern scientific “knowing” beginning to catch up. </p>

<p>The unexpected outbreak of Fex and Coo into our shared consciousness may have been incubated by all our musing and brooding over the Neanderthals, the Inklings, the artists at Lascaux, the shamans dancing, weaving, calling. Ironic that writing about something led to something else entering the writing. Perhaps that’s what Lorca’s rose was seeking, that “something else.” And perhaps, as you suggest, the exercise of our imaginative capacity, free of excessive intentionality, may lead us—each of us, individually—into the future that we’re capable of, at our best. That’s more or less what I think the idea of “angels” implies: The future coming to meet us, helping us to imagine our way out of the traps that encumber us, freeing us to discover those further possibilities. </p>

<p>We must not forget the critical element in all this—the Eros commitment to give our love to what exceeds our understanding. This amounts to giving the gift of our gifts back to the original donor—the circular interplay of creature with creation. </p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> At the end of my little Goethean exercise, I wrote: To be continued or not... While these dialogues have been between you and me, I find myself wondering what psychic wanderings, imaginal by-ways, dreams, synchronicities and such these dialogues may have stirred up in our readers. Let’s invite others to join in, an Eros invitation if you will, to participate in further installments of <em>Dreams, Bones and the Future</em>.</p>

<p><em>This is the ninth in a series of excerpts from an ongoing dialogue between Russell Lockhart and Paco Mitchell.</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>Queries &amp; Speculations Twenty-Three: Eros and Thanatos</h2><!--/nopreview--> </p>

<p><strong>Paco Mitchell:</strong> Russ, we’ve had many conversations about the contemporary and the upcoming world-situations, and we’re no strangers to its more “dour” aspects. You have the excuse of being a fully-fledged Scot, and therefore can claim to be “dour by nature”, though you also claim to be “optimistic by nature” at the same time—an apparent conflict. My guess is that this is simply human ambivalence, which expresses itself at the most basic levels, all the way down to the mystery of X and Y chromosomes during fertilization, for example, or perhaps the fact that <em>homo sapiens</em> is deeply rooted in the <em>reptilian</em> brain—wisdom growing from the serpent. On the other hand, I can only claim partial Scottish dourness, due to the mixed bloodlines in my family. Therefore, I will claim the remainder of my own dourness as deriving from a genetic <em>Bohemian</em> off-shoot which, fancifully, may account for my passionate involvement in Gypsy flamenco and the <em>cante jondo</em>. But that’s another story. </p>

<p>All this is a half-whimsical introduction to the extremely powerful impact your reply to Q &amp; S Twenty-Two had on me. We have been working our slow, sinuous, reptilian way for some time now, and I can’t help but feel that we are standing at the brink of something that is practically beyond words. In fact, between our last exchange and this one, I happened to re-read your book <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1391272.Psyche_Speaks">Psyche Speaks</a></em>, and I found you saying much the same thing, about the still-living possibility of a nuclear holocaust. In other words, it produced a sadness in you that virtually left you speechless.</p>

<p>I feel much the same way. Considering everything you noted in your reply to Q &amp; S Twenty-Two there seem to be no real “solutions” to the accelerating consequences of the global climate dilemma, solutions so many people expect others to find and carry out for them. Most of the proposed solutions will simply perpetuate what got us into this situation in the first place. Thus, we are approaching what you rightly see as an extremity that will quite possibly activate an <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiodromia">enantiodromia</a></em> of colossal proportions. It will take something supremely huge to shock us out of our slumber—something profoundly <em>different</em> from what we are comfortable with. And even then, as you say, it may not be enough to enable us to alter course <em>in time</em>. Recently, I had a brief conversation with a stranger in a coffee shop. Complementing him on his rakish tweed driver’s cap, we quickly lapsed into one of those “forbidden” climate conversations. Before I knew it, he was using the “E” word (extinction). But he could only follow it up with the notion of <em>giving up</em>, which he repeated over and over. In other words, it seemed that when he contemplated the possibility of human extinction, all he could see was “giving up”. Curiously, I don’t hear you doing that, or myself, or any of the avowed “collapse-niks”, as they humorously call themselves at times, who are devoted to this topic. Everyone I am aware of—the writers who take these dire and dour possibilities to the most extreme points imaginable—end up affirming some form of Eros, or love, or kindness, or generosity, even if it portends or accompanies the end of life. I found it remarkable that in your profound book Psyche Speaks, that’s where you ended up: the threads that ultimately lead us to death, also lead us to what may be the most profound human force of all: Eros. My Q &amp; S Twenty-Three, then, is: What do you think of this?</p>

<p><strong>Russell Lockhart:</strong> In Freud’s seminal paper, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ego_and_the_Id">“The Ego and the Id”</a>, published in 1923, he distinguished between two instincts: the <em>death</em> instinct, “the task of which is to lead organic matter back to the inorganic state”, and <em>Eros</em> which “aims at more far-reaching coalescence of the particles into which living matter has been dispersed”. Earlier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Stekel">Wilhelm Stekel</a> had called the “death wish” by the name <em>Thanatos</em>. Freud never used this term for the death instinct because of his dislike of Stekel. Freud continued to develop his conception of this duality between Eros and the death instinct, to the point where he wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents">Civilization and Its Discontents</a> in 1930: “The fateful question of the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent the cultural process developed in it will succeed in mastering the derangements of communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction… Men have brought their powers of subduing the forces of nature to such a pitch that by using them they could now very easily exterminate one another to the last man”. Freud here suggests that the combination of the death instinct and human ingenuity could lead to the extermination of the human species. This was <em>before</em> the possibility of nuclear extermination and before any apprehension about the ability of the planet to sustain human life given man’s destructive effect on the environment and other life forms. </p>

<p>This raises a question. The “return to inorganic matter” is the fate of each one of us individually. This is a biological given and each of us must come to terms with our life’s end in our own way. But can it be that the species <em>itself</em> harbors a “death wish” for the species as a whole? Would that be the <em>final</em> Ragnarök? This idea has more “explanatory” power than we might wish to acknowledge. Freud concludes his essay with this extraordinary statement: “And now it may be expected that the other of the two <em>heavenly forces</em>, eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain itself alongside of his equally immortal adversary”. It is fascinating that Freud here raises Eros and Thanatos—previously referred to as human instincts—to <em>heavenly forces</em> (Freud’s emphasis). Freud here is speaking of Eros as an immortal force beyond the human which will be putting forth his strength to “maintain itself” against Thanatos, its immortal adversary. What is it that led Freud to <em>expect</em> Eros to exert itself in this way? Whatever it was, something else happened to Freud, which led him two years later to write in his <em>New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…our best hope for the future is that the intellect—the scientific spirit, reason—should in time establish a dictatorship over the human mind. Whatever…opposes such a development is a danger for the future of mankind.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I wrote in Psyche Speaks, when first commenting on Freud’s conclusions: “Here Freud seems to forget his call to Eros and falls into the typical stance of siding with reason against the soul. I feel that Freud’s earlier stance was more correct, that the battle is not between Eros and Logos, but between Eros and Thanatos. Thanatos seems ever present in today’s world. But where is Eros? If anything, the world has grown darker since I wrote those words thirty-six years ago, and Eros seems even less visible and present. <em>Psyche Speaks</em> was my effort to point to Eros as what is needed. Jung called this a “great dream”. Jung said that this great dream has always spoken through the <em>artist</em> as “mouthpiece” proclaiming the arrival of the coming guest. It is the artist’s love and passion (the human eros) that needs to be listened to in order to proclaim and welcome the coming guest (the heavenly Eros). In my view, it was the artist in each of us that would be the source of what was necessary to welcome the coming guest. But we seem far from such a realization and manifestation. The earlier Freud expects the arrival of the heavenly Eros. The later Jung expects the arrival of the coming guest. I think both great men are talking about the same thing. Thus, in the face of the final Ragnarök, which seems ever more certain, one may either give up in despair, entertain oneself to death, or manifest ever more fully the human Eros that is love and passion and generative creativity. One must perhaps, celebrate both the final Ragnarök and welcome Eros, the coming guest.</p>

<h2>Queries &amp; Speculations Twenty-Four: Freud’s Religion</h2>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Russ, your reply to my Q &amp; S Twenty-Three was superb and fascinating. As usual, however, I did get caught up in some tangential questions about some of Freud’s language and epistemological assumptions—in use for over a century and taken for granted by many. I’m referring mainly to the terms “death-instinct” and “death-wish”. The questions I have about their early uses leave me wondering what to think about their altered use by the “1930 Freud”. Maybe you can help. First, I don’t pretend to be a Freudian, if only because of my resistance to <em>reductive materialism</em> generally and reductive dream interpretations. But, despite the ambiguity of the terms instinct and wish, both of which overwhelmingly lend themselves to life-processes, the gist of Freud’s “death-instinct” and “death-wish” seems to reside in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and its concept of the <em>entropic</em> running down of everything, in what many physicists seem to take pleasure—even a certain glee—in calling the “heat-death of the universe”. This “law” may be as close as we get in modern science to a religious absolutism. Absolute materialism, with no room for the psyche <em>per se</em>, as far as I can see. </p>

<p>So far, then, Freud lines up on one side with the reductive materialists, and Jung, more tolerant of mystery, lines up on the other, on the side of <em>teleological psychologists</em>, let’s call them. But then we arrive at Freud’s unusual reference to the two “heavenly forces”—“eternal Eros” and “his equally immortal adversary (the death-wish, aka ‘Thanatos’)”. Unless I’m missing something, this is anything but the reductive, materialistic Freudian language we’re accustomed to. In fact, one could avail oneself of these same kinds of terms in referring to the archetypal nature of Jung’s collective unconscious. It is certainly <em>not</em> language one would find being bandied about at a Thermodynamics Physics Conference. It’s as if Freud came around over the years and slipped a few non-materialistic “zingers” into his text. So, Russ, after all those decades of Freud’s obeisance to what I’m calling the “absolutism of Thermodynamics”, do you think he was freeing himself from the noose a bit—maybe even from his <em>theory</em>—and opening to his original supporter, then his adversary and failed Crown Prince—Jung? How do you understand this text of the “mystical Freud”?</p>

<p><strong>RL:</strong> Freud did refer to Jung as his “successor and crown prince”. This metaphoric phrase, which is based on images of monarchy, places Freud as King and Jung as Crown Prince. This is understood without any complications—psychoanalysis as kingdom. But when Freud says that Jung is his “Joshua to his Moses”, then we have Freud as Moses and Jung as Joshua—another kingdom, but now a <em>religious</em> one. Joshua was Moses’ assistant and he became leader of the Israelites after the death of Moses. But why would a devout atheist and devoted materialist such as Freud use this religious imagery—even metaphorically? Even more puzzling is Freud’s reference to Jung as “the spirit of my spirit”. When Freud made these references to Jung, the depth of connection between the two men is obvious. By 1907, Freud had suffered disappointment after disappointment in seeking someone to carry on his work and bring him and his psychoanalytic kingdom the international recognition that was his passion and his dream (in the “aspirational” sense). In a similar vein, Jung had suffered many disappointments in finding a true mentor, one might say, a deep and powerful father. </p>

<p>In 1907, they found each other, and the possibility of each other’s needs being met, in their first personal meeting, a meeting lasting 13 hours. Others have pointed out how Freud transferred his “homoerotic” connection from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Fliess">Wilhelm Fliess</a> to Jung. From their first encounter, Jung, though fully enamored, was troubled by Freud’s utter rejection of Jung’s invoking the paranormal dimension to explain the knife shattering during their encounter. Others have pointed out as well, Jung’s lifelong trouble in relationships with men. Later, Freud would accuse Jung of harboring a death wish for Freud. </p>

<p>Despite its promise of fulfilling each other’s deep needs, the Freud-Jung relationship was ill-fated from the beginning. I think this mutual regard followed by the complete break between the two men (1913), set the stage for historical crosscurrents still at work today. Freud wrote in his final personal letter to Jung, that Jung had remarked at the 1912 Munich conference, that an intimate relationship with a man inhibited his scientific freedom. By breaking off their intimate relation, Freud told Jung to take his full freedom and to forego any “tokens of friendship”. Freud had asked Jung not to abandon the sexual theory, but to make a dogma of it, an “unshakable bulwark” against the “black tide of mud of occultism”. Jung later characterized this as unscientific and a clear example of Freud’s “personal power drive”. But more importantly, Jung described this as “an indisputable confession of faith”, whose only aim was “to suppress doubt”.  Here, it seems to me, Jung is responding to Freud’s <em>religion</em>: Jung was <em>not</em> a good Joshua to Freud’s adamantine Moses. And Freud’s religion? Since Freud said he had no religion, was an avowed atheist and a profound materialist, why refer to his religion? I think there are grounds for a different view than the usual one and I’ll try to weave various threads together for a coherent sense of what I mean, keeping in mind I am trying to elucidate inchoate intuitions.</p>

<p>Freud, in one trip to Rome, had placed himself in front of Michelangelo’s Moses every day for thirteen days. What was Freud doing? We can say he was identifying with Moses. But in what sense? What is the <em>ground</em> of the connection between Moses and Freud? Freud’s last major work, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_and_Monotheism">Moses and Monotheism</a></em> published in 1939, caused Freud such difficulty, that he finally referred to it as his “fiction”. In this work, Freud claimed that Moses was not Hebrew, but born into Egyptian nobility. Freud conjectured that Moses was a <em>follower</em> of Akhenaten, an ancient <em>monotheist</em> ruler. Freud speculated that it was the <em>murder</em> of Moses by <em>his followers</em> that led to collective guilt that induced the hoped-for return of Moses as the Messiah. The Jewish religion, Freud said, was developed to alleviate this guilt. Freud died a few months after the publication of Moses and Monotheism. In this late “fiction”, Freud rationally constructs his “explanation” of the Jewish religion, while not observing how these very same factors played such a part—or metaphorically—in his own psychoanalytic kingdom, its followers, and its heretics. Is it possible that what this fiction reveals are Freud’s own deep religious currents, perhaps ghosts of his father’s Hasidism and accomplishments in the study of Torah? Critics have latched onto this and said that Freud’s audacious claims were, indeed, “pure fiction”. Perhaps it is in Freud’s <em>fictions</em> that his “underground” religious nature is most revealed.</p>

<p>Freud was identifying with Moses, not as the figure of the Hebrew religion, but with Moses as the murdered monotheist Egyptian. So, what is it that this “fiction” is picturing? In 1907, Freud was asked to produce a list of “ten good books”. On Freud’s list was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Merezhkovsky">Dimitry Seregeyevich Merezhovsky’s</a> <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Romance_of_Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci: A Biographical Novel from the Turn of the Fifteenth Century</a></em>, published in 1902, and read by Freud in German translation in 1903. This book was the second volume of a trilogy referred to as “Christ and Anti-Christ”. The first volume was entitled <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Gods">The Death of the Gods</a></em>. The third volume was entitled <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Alexis">Peter and Alexis</a></em>. Merezhovsky is no longer well known or read, but in Freud’s day, he was a major literary figure in Russia and in Europe. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature ten times. He founded the symbolist movement in Russia. He was seen as continuing the legacy of Turgenev, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. His poetry was set to music by Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky. He and his wife (a major poet) were the most prolific literary couple in Russian history. And, of most relevance to our present context, he founded the religious movement known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Merezhkovsky#The_Third_Testament">“The Third Testament”</a>. </p>

<p>The first symbolist novel, <em>The Death of the Gods: Julian the Apostate</em>, focused on Emperor Julian, who tried to reinstate the Olympian Gods after the triumph of Christian monotheism. In the novel, Christianity is pictured as a cult that denies the body and where redemption cannot be attained on earth. Merezhovsky pictured this denial as denial of reality. In the novel, Christians treat Julian as the Antichrist. In this and the rest of the trilogy, Merezhovsky argues that the highest level of human development is the uniting of spirit and body <em>on earth</em>. For these views, Merezhovsky was persecuted by the Russian Church and the Russian authorities, his books banned and burned. Shortly after the turn of the century, Merezhovsky and his wife formed a group called, “Religious-Philosophical Meetings”, devoted to perfecting the union of spirit and body. After a short time, the meetings were declared illegal by the Russian Orthodox Church, but were revived again in 1907, when Merezhovsky began promulgating the idea of the Kingdom to come under the advent of the Holy Ghost. </p>

<p>Merezhovsky revived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_of_Fiore">Joachim of Fiore’s</a> twelfth-century doctrine of the “Third Kingdom”, which was to be the Kingdom, not of God, not of the Son, but of the Holy Ghost. Merezhovsky saw such a time as the union of all previous polar opposites (e.g., body and spirit, male and female, rational and irrational, etc.), and manifest on earth. In this he saw art playing a crucial role in this evolution of what humans could become. This is the Third Testament that Merezhovsky proposed. He foresaw that this evolution would be preceded by catastrophes, not the least of which would be necessary revolutions and rebellions in the state, in institutions, in religions, essentially in all structures. Needless to say, his ideas were seen as scandalous and heretical, just as scandalous and heretical as did Freud’s ideas which followed. His books and prophecies have been, in the words of one commentator, “aggressively forgotten”, until the past decade, where his work is now receiving serious attention.</p>

<p>So, after this excursus, how does the work of Merezhovsky relate to your question about Freud’s eternal heavenly Eros? It does appear that Freud stepped out of his Moses self in talking about Eros and the death instinct (Thanatos) in 1930, before he fell back into “the laws” promulgated in 1932. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Russell">AE’s</a> “Pilgrim of Eternity”, Merezhovsky’s “Holy Ghost”, “Freud’s “Eternal Eros”, Jung’s “Coming Guest”, all point to some future time when life on earth will be changed from anything humans have ever known. Life on earth transformed. All these conceptions were intuited in the declining years of the Piscean age. All are perhaps intuitive pictures of life on earth in the coming Aquarian age. They all in one way or another embody the idea of <em>union</em> of opposites. </p>

<p>I have two sons. Hill is 6 months and Blake, 3 years old. They have caused my wife, Dale and I many happy days with much pleasure, as well as many sleepless nights and much anxiety. I know that I spend far more time with my sons than my father spent with me, through no fault of his own. Men of his generation (he's 65) left much of the early care of the children to their wives. This is less common in my generation. I've had to train myself how to be with my boys; it's something I taught myself. I've had to reach deep inside to extract a workable model, sometimes skipping a generation to remember my grandfathers. </p>

<p>Recently when I was fishing with Blake from our tiny boat one laid back afternoon, I remembered a dream I had before he was born, in fact, when I was deciding whether to become a father at all in my early 30's. The dream, though simple in itself, revealed complex generational layers of father-son interaction and helped give me the boost I needed to brave the waters of fatherhood. I dreamt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A sad boy's voice calls out "My father never took me fishing".</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke with a deep sense of grief that stayed with me for days. I discussed my dream and feelings with Dale, my most trusted dream analyst. I told it to my sister, Anne, who is 4 years younger than I. I even shared it with my mother, perhaps not judiciously, since she still harbors resentment toward her ex-husband, who divorced her in 1969.</p>

<p>In order to get a handle on what the dream meant to me, I returned to my childhood and remembered my love of fishing. Give me a hook, some old string, any slab of bait and some water to throw it into and I was a happy kid. I loved fishing and still do, with approximately the same skill as that 9 year old and his funky equipment. The truth is, that my father rarely did take me fishing. My friends' dads took me, my two grandfathers and an uncle someimes took me, but rarely my dad. Sons don't want substitutes, they want their fathers.</p>

<p>The emphasis on the word "never" in my dream struck me. It wasn't literally or completely true, since Bob had on occasions taken me fishing. Perhaps the dream image was metaphorical? I thought back to my many dreams of fishing. A common symbol in my dreams is of fish... catching or losing them: big ones, sick ones; fish from deep or shallow waters, pond or rushing river. I believe fish refer to my inner creative life, just as the fish historically refers to the Christ as the source of all life. Fishing represents for me pleasure, relaxation, creativity, sustenance. In short, both physical and spiritual sustenance.</p>

<p>So what was it that my father never did with me? He never taught me how to use my spiritual life to sustain myself in the world. He couldn't teach me what he didn't know... he was trained to take care of others, to be a provider for his family... not to nurture his inner life. That's "selfish"! He was a decent father. He provided for his family the best way he knew how. I'm not angry with him for not giving me what I needed... he was preoccupied completely with his own marital, work and personal problems to such an extent that he couldn't teach his children the most important human function: how to nurture oneself ("self-fish"?). Without this ability, which I believe Dad lacked through no fault of his own, one cannot satisfactorily engage in relationships. Life to me is about relationships. The inability to relate to children is passed on from father to father until someone in a crisis recreates it through inspiration. </p>

<p>I was finally able to mourn and understand what was lacking in my childhood. Instead of being preoccupied with my loss, I was able to have the courage to become a father, to "take my sons fishing" in spite of my fears. I've still never told the dream to my father, though I've told him many other things in our working through to a communicative caring relationship. Perhaps he'll read this. I know his father rarely took him fishing. I sympathize with him. </p>

<p>It obviously takes time to learn how to be an effective self-nurturer and thereby a nurturer of ones' children. Many in my father's generation automatically assumed the responsibility of parenthood to be a by-product of marriage. I waited 10 years for fatherhood not in order to indulge myself in a selfish "me generation", but so that I might know myself a little better than my father knew himself, so that my children could benefit from my "self-fishing".</p>

<p>I am in a motel in the SouthWest desert (I had been living in Sedona for awhile) with my mother and her sister, my Aunt Esther. It's a '50's decorated place. My Aunt had actually had her leg amputated and she was in this state in the dream. My Aunt and I are looking out of a big picture window, divided into a grid. It is sunset, and I say, "Look how beautiful the sunset is." </p>

<p>We gaze out the window at the horizon; it is brilliant orange and red. On the far-distant horizon I see what at first seems like a huge black cloud... but it's a flock of blackbirds flying towards us. As the flock flies closer, their shapes get bigger,change and I strain my eyes to see and I say in astonishment, "That's not birds, they're trees!" </p>

<p>A column of uprooted trees is flying in a vector formation toward us and is encompassing the whole vista of the dream. The trees have no leaves, they are black trees with huge roots and branches flying across the sky. As they fly over the motel, I panic and say "We've got to get out of here." </p>

<p>The scene shifts to outside the motel in the parking lot and a '57 era station wagon is parked outside with wooden panelled sides. I jump in the driver's seat, my Aunt beside me in front and my mother in the back seat. (I actually don't drive in my waking life.) I start the car and begin driving off across the desert. There are no roads. The gigantic trees are flying overhead of us now and I am racing to get out of their flight path. I think that they are going to start falling... and sure enough a tree drops on top of the car roof, denting it. I can feel the weight on my head. I know we will all be fine and continue to drive with the weight of the tree on the car. </p>

<p><em>I awaken in a panic-feeling that this was a big dream. My intuitional, emotional sense of it was that the trees were very angry, like they were saying we aren't going to take it anymore and they uprooted themselves and were flying away... off the planet.</em></p>

  <p><em>"The true history of the spirit is not preserved in learned volumes but in the living psychic organism of every individual." -C.G. Jung C.W. 11,56</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>I. Psyche Speaks</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>It is quite remarkable, because it is so rare, to see in public such a collection of unattributed, uncommented, unexplained, unanalyzed, uninterpreted dreams as those <a href="../bcpqoa3iell">on exhibit in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em></a> this past year. As your editor said in introducing this unusual gathering, she wanted "psyche to speak for itself" in response to the journal's research calling for "dreams which belong to the larger community." This simple appeal reaped a rich and varied bounty. </p>

<p>Yes, psyche has spoken! But to whom? To what end? Do not expect me to answer these questions by interpreting or analyzing the dreams in this exhibition. That would violate the spirit with which they were gathered. Instead, imagine we had been viewing these dreams in silence and began speaking with one another. A conversation. For some reason, in the face of these dreams, I want to speak in whispers, though these dreams stir strong passions in me. Of course, my murmurings on these pages are rather one sided. So I'll just set off and see what comes.</p>

<h2>II. Dreams as Gift &amp; Voice of Source</h2>

<p>What has been gathered together in this harvest called "Dreaming Humanity's Path," this dream gallery of psyche's speech? First, we find dreams experienced as gifts given to an audience of one (the dreamer) arriving unbidden, seemingly from some dimension beyond the personal and gifted again to a larger audience .... we, the community of the journal's readers. As the word itself reveals (com-, "together"; munnus, "gift"), it is precisely this circulation of gifts, this "gifting together" that identifies the essential nature of any genuine community. In some quiet time you might want to ponder how to keep such gifts circulating. </p>

<p>Second, we find dreams experienced as big dreams, dreams of strikingly numinous intensity, the dreamer impelled to share the dream with another, as if following some ancient imperative... perhaps even one of evolutionary significance.</p>

<h2>"This dream is not yours alone; it belongs to others as well. Tell it!"</h2>

<p>Surely one intention of such dreams and their telling is to stir us to wakefulness, to choicefull participation in the making of our future. </p>

<p>Third, the dreamer of the big dream experiences a strangely palpable contact with "the source" of that dream, and in gifting the dream to others, this sense of contact and thus potential community with "the source" is enlarged. All readers and hearers of the big dream may become directly or subliminally more related to "the source" of such dreams. I'll leave it to the reader to imagine the social and political consequences of this. </p>

<p>Fourth, this "source" is not experienced as personal or individual. One feels a bit shy even at saying "my" dream. Rather, there is a sense of something "sent", as if by courier, a meaning-filled message from underneath or beyond the personal. There is as well a definite feeling that it is this "rhizomic" dimension in which we all may be connected in some mysterious and unfathomable way. We can't say much about this "source" with any assurance. And while there are many names for this source, I will refer to it here simply as the mythic realm. I think the reason why such dreams are sensed by the dreamer as having immediate significance, not only to the dreamer but to everyone, is because such dreams are intimations of myths in formation, myths that will underlie the fabric of all that we are and all that we do, and all that we will become. Such dreams are not just recyclings of old myths or retellings in new clothes, but <em>new</em> myths that will be the structure and dynamics of our future.</p>

<p>The dreams collected here might be titled more accurately, "Dreaming Humanity's Path<em>s</em>", for it is surely more meaningful to think not of one fixed future, but of many possible futures. What our conscious role in such futures might be, what determinant role our choices might have, could be informed by big dreams in a way that we have scarcely allowed ourselves to imagine.</p>

<h2>III. Dreams &amp; Community</h2>

<p>The reason why interpretation fails big dreams is that interpretation tends toward understanding even big dreams only in terms of what already is known, while the big dream is speaking, as Jung said, in terms that are not yet fully known. The big dream cannot be fully netted by interpretive approaches because it speaks in a language (or languages) not yet fully known. In this sense, we must always be students of the big dream, trying always to learn the language of the mythic realm, to learn psyche's speech. </p>

<p>In earlier times, when communities were truly local, such dreams were conveyed to "the elders" and if judged to be big dreams, they were then conveyed to all members of the community. This way with the dream played a crucial role in engendering the fabric of community life because such dreams became the source of and foundation for the myths of the people. In the present time, this natural sense of sharing the big dream with others is so rare we have very nearly lost all sense of the crucial importance of this. We no longer even have rituals for doing so. We need to relearn this art. </p>

<p>In the contemporary world, how do such dreams find their way into community? What and when does the larger community ever hear of such dreams? Where in the world do we hear these messages from the mythic realm in a collective sense? I hear nothing of this on the TV talk shows. I see nothing in the newspapers. I do not hear our "elders" or world leaders telling us of big dreams. </p>

<p>This is where <em>Dream Network</em> is doing important work and where the dream sharing groups and communities have their ultimate significance. We have no larger forums for hearing our big dreams. In <em>Psyche Speaks</em>, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...to have psyche's speech heard only in consulting rooms will not suffice in the time to come; psyche's voice must be heard in the world, enacted and incarnated in the world."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How I would love to see a journal, a TV program, a radio show, even a web site in which only the dream text itself is presented, a cultural repository for big dreams. Seeing these dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em> is like a seedling for such possibilities. We need places to hear big dreams. As a community we can contribute to this need by continuing to send in our big dreams to Dream Network. Something will come of this! </p>

<h2>IV. Alterity, Fate &amp; Dream's Desire</h2>

<p>We can't say much about "the source" except to emphasize its strong sense of alterity, its otherness. It is this alterity that the big dream brings to our awareness and, I believe, stirs a yearning, a deep desire, an eros. Part of this is reflected as noted above in the impulse to share the dream with others. But telling others, as deeply satisfying as this is, is not sufficient. Something else is at work on us in relation to the big dream. A hint as to what this might be was offered to me in a dream several years ago. In it, I found written on a slip of paper, poem like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>A dream wants a dream</em></h2>
  
  <h2><em>A poem wants a poem</em></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as I enjoy interpreting dreams, teaching others to learn and exercise the craft of interpretation, and even as an analyst getting paid for it, I know that interpretation is not the desire of the dream. The dream wants a dream! So, now I imagine that the purpose of the "small" dream is to make us conscious and more complete (that is through resolving complexes, integrating the shadow, developing our human relatedness), essential, crucial and necessary tasks. </p>

<p>And the purpose of the big dream? Its purpose is twofold: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>To engender community through the medium of telling the dream, that is, dream calling to dream, the dream of one desiring the dream of the other, and </p></li>
<li><p>To create a sense of task, the sense of what the dreamer is <em>for</em> in this life, and from that, for the dreamer to bring the manifestation of that to some realization in actual life and therefore into the reality that is the world. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps this sense of human community may become realized in the Aquarian age, the age of the water bearer. This is an image of each one of us in some unique contact with "the source" and from that contact bringing something back to the larger community. Part of that "bringing back" is the dream itself and part of our contribution to the weaving of the threads of community is to tell our big dreams to one another. In this way, the "otherness" in the big dream is able to call forth the "otherness" in others through engendering dreams in others. </p>

<p>The dream wants a dream. But our task is not complete by telling only. The big dream always imposes some task on the dreamer. That task has a great deal to do with whatever we mean by "fate." It is the work of the dreamer to bring into presently lived life some manifestation of the big dream. That manifestation, too, will likely be shared and will constitute, through its giftlike circulation, a vitalizing presence in the world. </p>

<h2>V. Dream-Formed Communities</h2>

<p>Klee said he didn't want to give talks about art because people would listen with their ears and not their hands. And if one were to listen with one's hands? Of course! Listening hands would be painting hands! A painting wants a painting! That's why Baudelaire said the only proper criticism of a work of art is a work of art. Art wants art! This desire is not ego's desire but the desire of the "other" in us for connection to " the other" in our fellow beings. It is out of this connection (deep psyche to deep psyche) that there could arise a basis for community that would be generative and give birth and manifestation to the deepest intentionality of the psyche. This is what I see as the ultimate significance of sharing big dreams: <em>a dream-formed community</em>. This is not a picture of only single, isolated individuals individuating apart from the world. </p>

<p>The purpose of individuation cannot be isolation. Rather, the purpose of individuation must be for an individual to develop sufficiently to hear the "deep song" of the psyche, to bring into the world what is experienced there, and to pour this into the living history of humanity. This in turn will call to the deep psyche in others and stimulate this self-same process. It is the iteration of this process across individuals that is the promise of the postmodern spirit. The intent is not narrow, narcissistic individualism, but to so engage individual development so that the common pool becomes a rich resource for the nourishment and growth of each and everyone. As Jung saw, <em>"individuation gathers the world to itself."</em> </p>

<h2>VI. Forming the Vessel</h2>

<p>A newspaper published recently a story of two women artists who decided to correspond only in painting. So, one woman sent a painting to the other. After living and being with that painting for a time, that woman painted her response and sent it off. Back and forth, paintings only. Twenty of these paintings are now on exhibit in a gallery. Very instructive! For anyone drawn to dream sharing, corresponding in dreams (just the dreams, not the interpretation!) may open up many new and unexplored possibilities. As a community we might try just this and see what happens. Or, in your dream sharing groups try this. Sit for a time in silence and bring to mind dreams or visions that had a powerful impact on you. When you feel ready, simply speak out an image from such a dream. Others will do the same. Round and round, speaking out only images from dreams, no comment, no interpretation, no explanation. Telling images without the apparatus of explanation engenders a powerful field effect in the group, a palpable dimensionality that begins to generate an enormous eros. One gets the impression of a vessel of information, a place of potential incarnation of something beyond the personal aspects of the dreamers in the circle. The potential of this is unexplored. And waiting. </p>

<p>What is certain, however, is that working on the group's aspirations, difficulties, troubles, issues, or other concerns following such an experience, is remarkable. We don't generally seem to have much faith in the idea that the dream (like a story, like art of any sort) can engender its effects all by itself. We seem addicted to the idea that for the dream to have its effect it must be interpreted and explained. </p>

<p>This would be like insisting that a poem always be published with its explanation, a painting always viewed along side its critique. That is nonsense. The whole point of the poem, art, and yes, the dream too, is to "get through," to achieve some conception in the psyche of its audience. It is what happens next that is crucial, not what we say about it, but what it engenders in us as response from our own depth. A dream wants a dream. A poem wants a poem. This nexus of relationship: dream to dream, poem to poem, painting to painting, is largely unexplored territory. What did you dream in response to those "naked" dreams in the pages of <em>Dream Network</em>?</p>

<p>It's something like the above that leads me to imagine a future in which the dream once again takes on a value and role even in the centers of power. Is such a thing possible? As I watch the leaders of the world gathered together in a truly extraordinary way at Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, how I would love for them to sit circled with one another and with nothing else as agenda, simply tell the images from their dreams, round and round, until they feel that dimensionality of alterity. Such experience could become a basis for experiencing what "the source" has to say about what needs to be manifested in the future. In this, they and others would discover that the basis of their rejection of "the other" in human form, is a result of not genuinely experiencing "the other" in mythic form. All true experience of the mythic dimension generates an eros of inclusiveness. The failure of this generates the power of exclusiveness and becomes the secret source of the ubiquity and power of prejudice.</p>

<h2>VII. Dream as Subversive</h2>

<p>In these times there is, on occasion, a yearning for something that truly punctures our consciousness, something that breaks through the increasingly addictive fog of image-driven consumerist miasma. Occasionally, world events (atrocities, assassinations, natural calamities), often times local events (killings close to home, the rage at horrific secrets revealed), sometimes personal experiences (a sudden loss, a reversal, a tragedy) break through this fog. Still, so much of this is now mediated by media, rather than direct experience, that its shock value, its potential of penetration, is lessening remarkably in our lifetime. It's as if we could arrive very shortly, perhaps more shortly than we care to imagine, at having TV cameras showing us bodies being delivered to the ovens, or the killing fields, while we sit silently couched to inaction, hungering for the next scene. When reality becomes entertainment what then? </p>

<p>Today, we are double yoked to insatiable work and endless entertainment. Underlying all of this is the commodification of desire. This is what is whipping us along. I continue to believe that the last holdout to this process, that which will retain the power to puncture our increasing insensibility, will be the dream. I continue to believe that the dream will be the last resistance to the devouring dynamics of money. And because of this, we may be edging close to a time when it will be a crime to dream and there will be every effort made to control this uncontrollable access to a source beyond the world of power. The dream is always subversive of the status quo, particularly the big dream. The dream will always be outlaw, always alien. At some point the dream will threaten the established order, as that order becomes ever more rigid and confined. As more and more of the population becomes medicated as a means of coping with the increasing density of events and their demands on our time and attention, the dream will begin to fade away as is the fate of dreams under most medications.</p>

<p>Power will attempt to appropriate the dream. Already this appropriation is happening in language where "dream" is now the buzzword in advertisement. Listen to this add for Compuserve: "What do you dream of doing? Does it involve work? Or travel? Or your children? Is your dream to create something? Or go somewhere? Or meet someone? Is it a big overwhelming dream? Or just a tiny dream the size of your baby? Is understanding a part of your dream? Is joy? Is fun? No matter what you dream of, go online with Compuserve. Maybe if you had ten free hours on our online service, you could get that fat, lazy dream off the ground." Watch for how dream increasingly is used in relation to money, possession, and power. </p>

<h2>VIII. Embracing the Future</h2>

<p>Dreams are not "about" the past at all; instead they are the psyche's way of <em>preparing</em> the future. Not preparing for the future, but preparing the future. So a dream does not "predict" the future so much as it is a thread from which the future is woven. It is not that there is a future fixed and immutable that incarnates itself inevitably, nor some pre-design that is rolling out like clockworks; rather, the future is prepared as a cooking, a weaving, and these things we call dreams are as if tasting a dish in preparation, a weaving in the making. Are these the futures we want? Are we free to choose? What part can we play consciously?</p>

<p>What is privileged, then, in my view, is the dream. We mortgage our future when we mobilize our energies only to re-birthing the past. We are coming to a time of the bankruptcy of these methodologies -the old psychologies of the dream. The past is known (or we like to think so) and is therefore secure and provides us with limits within which to operate. The future is insecure (and cannot be predicted) and so we try to reduce it inevitably to the knownness of the past. We see the future only as an extension of the past and therefore we are secure in the legitimacy of privileging the past as the source of our facing the future. </p>

<p>But what if this is not so? Let us imagine that different futures are possible from the same past and that it takes only a minor variation to lead to a profound bifurcation with the past.... and that the source of that "minor variation" is pictured to us in those experiences we call dreams, particularly big dreams. So it would be what we "construct" with the guidance of the big dream, how we enact the big dream that will yield a rich new way of leading us into the future. </p>

<p>That is why I so value what we have begun here in <em>Dream Network</em>. The raw dream, dream brut, is the most powerful antidote I can imagine to the not so subtle and escalating fascism throughout the world, that seeks increasingly to control our thought and soul. We must take solace and inspiration from the simple fact that no one will pay money for a dream. Dreams are freely given to us and must be freely given in return. </p>

<p>The community that learns to operate on the basis of the circulating gift of dreams will be the community immune to the commodification of desire that so threatens the true potential of the human spirit. </p>

<p>I'd like to know what these dreams and thoughts have stirred in you, so by all means, whether in shouts or whispers, let me know.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Illustration by <a href="http://www.dalegottlieb.com/">Dale Gottlieb</a></i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>During the summer of '83 I was working in a dirty, crowded pottery studio in downtown Manhattan, trying to get my small business organized. My wife Dale and I had moved to Brooklyn the year before in order to help her rapidly growing illustration career. I missed the home we had built and still owned in New Hampshire where I was more used to the "laid back" attitude of country life. I also missed our 5 year old meditation group where we had frequently shared dreams. In short, I felt disconnected and miserable. </p>

<p>One day, while glazing some teapots and listening to the radio, I heard about the "Self Help Clearinghouse," a service that people could call for information about meditation groups, self-help groups, and other activities. I called that day and asked if there were any dream groups in Manhattan. But I got the number of the <em>Brooklyn Dream Community</em> instead. I met Tom Cowan the director, and a week later found myself in a group of 15 strangers at his apartment in Brooklyn, where I volunteered to share a recent dream. <a href="../@billstimson">Bill Stimson</a> was leading the group that night, using <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman's</a> method of group adoption of the dream in a protective environment. Here is the dream I shared: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I am teaching a baby - a gorgeous infant - how to swim underwater. I begin by teaching him how to hold his breath, then we work our way to progressively more difficult things. He is fat and happy, learns fast, and loves the water. I am astonished at how well he swims underwater. There are other people watching us from the beach - I sense there may be some disapproval of my actions but I ignore their fears. I don't think the baby is my child but am unsure."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the group, led by Bill, adopted and worked with my dream, I felt a powerful insight that I was about to embark on a new project in my life, one that would involve a spontaneous exploration of my unconscious that would be witnessed and shared by others. </p>

<p>I felt strangely moved and sensitized, and wrote Bill a <a href="../bcpov6krusep/separation-is-the-problem">letter</a> the next day, which he published in his two year old project, The <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>. Bill began the <em>DNB</em> about the same time that he started The Manhattan Dream Community the winter of '81. He was looking for a way to connect people to one another through the sharing of dreams in groups and everyday experience. His motivations were personal. He was looking for a way to connect with himself, and also for a way to help others connect with each other. For two years, through exhausting bouts of poverty, late night organizing and letter writing, he established a network of individuals interested in dreams throughout the US, Canada, Europe and even the Soviet Union. Soviet parapsychologists met clandestinely and shared their insights through DNB, as did Roman Catholic nuns, psychoanalysts, "shamanistic" dreamers, lucid dreamers, and other varied people. He always printed their names and addresses and hoped that interested people would contact one another, especially to form dream groups. Often they did, and articles, letters, and experiments in group dreaming came into being. </p>

<p>I met with the <em>Brooklyn Dream Community</em> for several months and also kept in touch with Bill and his work. One day he suggested I attend a Dream Leadership Training Workshop with him at Monte Ullman's home north of New York. I called Monte only to find that the workshop was filled. "Does anyone ever drop out?," I asked him. "Extremely rarely," was the reply. "Well if anyone does, please put me at the top of your list!" </p>

<p>That night I had the following dream (excerpted from my journal): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dale and I are driving Bill Stimson to Monte's workshop... Monte and his wife are very gracious. We all sit down. I'm aware that Dale and I will only be staying a couple of minutes. I say to the group, 'It's nice to have a home so full of light'... there suddenly seems to be room for Dale and I to attend, because someone cancelled. We decide to stay."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very next morning, Monte called to say that a woman had dropped out and there would be room for me if I wanted to attend. At this point, I felt I had no choice! I drove Bill up and back each day of the workshop, talking over dreams, plans, and goals for the future. At one point Bill asked, "Why don't you take over the <em>Bulletin</em>?" Touched by his offer, but not feeling ready for such a venture, I was hesitant. I really felt I didn't want it, but I began to have powerful dreams encouraging me to accept it. Here is an excerpt from one of several such dreams:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>" ...I sense Yoda's presence. The beauty of being joined through his eyes to an ancient, permanently connected Unconscious Mind that I usually deny. I think of Bill Stimson and how we are so alike in strange but similar ways, that the DNB is his "baby" - that to give it up would be hard for him... I feel a vision of the sharing of dreams realigning our perceptions to take in another, "unseparate" sense of other people, especially the ones we care about. I feel love reawakened. I feel joined to others in a sweet, "sexy", primal intelligence that does not "think" about love but "feels" about love, and reveals loving faces in my mind so gently that I can hardly bear it. I feel at one with these people and my self."</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke crying, overwhelmed by the connective power in dream work, and in sharing dreams, so strongly that I felt I had no choice but to accept editorship. </p>

<p>So, for over a year and a half I have buried myself in writing letters, developing a new graphic look for the <em>DNB</em> with computerized typesetting and Dale's beautiful drawings, have enlarged it to 20 pages and 6 issues a year... other people have generously volunteered to help with editing, paste-up, computerizing the subscriptions and a dozen day to day details. As a result, the <em>DNB</em> has more subscribers and more exchanges of dreamwork ideas and experiences. And I still have dreams about the importance of this network.</p>

<p>However, after 8 issues I've become overwhelmed by the worry and work, and am passing on the editorial torch to <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Bob Van de Castle</a> and <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a>, who in the past have offered to help out. The editorial staff and advisory board (as well as the general tone and format) will remain basically the same. I hope Henry and Bob will put their own fire into it... financial needs especially have pulled me in another direction and I have to devote time and energy to my new woodworking job in Claremont, New Hampshire.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6krudnb-1.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Illustration"/></p>

<p>I laid awake several nights over this decision and finally received some clarity from some dreams. In one, I was a construction worker at the woodshop where I now work, with a small group of other men. My right arm was covered with silver bracelets which the other men regarded as odd. But I felt a deep sense of belonging and peace. When I awoke I also knew the silver meant prosperity. </p>

<p>Although the DNB has always (usually just barely) paid for itself, there has never been money left over to pay editors and so forth. But a lot of attention and time are required to keep the thing rolling. Perhaps a shared editorship will make it less of a time-consumer. Many of you are aware of Henry's involvement with <em>The Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> and Bob's long involvement with dream study through The University of Virginia at Charlottesville. Both men have been active in dreamwork longer than I have and are also more experienced. Their success will be your success; DNB is ripe for another growth burst. </p>

<p>I never intended to take the Network on permanently, but it truly has been "my baby" for a while, and not easy to give up. I hope to write occasionally on these pages and help out where I can. <em>You</em> can help with letters, articles, resubscriptions and any feedback.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>One of my abiding interests in dreams is their relationship to the "Inner Voice" or "that of God in every man" (as the Quakers phrase it). This is because I came into dreamwork from meditation and prayer as well as being a 5 year student of an attitudinal healing workbook called <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. Edgar Cayce remains still today one of the clearest voices for the connection between dreams and God. My prayers led me into dream study because for me it was the clearest way to understand my feelings. It is possible to meditate very hard for years and still not know how one feels. Specifically, dreams made me aware of feelings toward members of my family. Subsequent healings have occurred between me and my father, mother, brother and sister... all attributable indirectly to feelings I came upon through dreams. All the members of my family send me dreams or discuss them over the phone and when we see one another. The family can be the best dream group! </p>

<p>When I was cutting wood with my older brother Pete last winter at his home in northern Maine, we got up around 5 a.m. It was dark and we sat groggily around the stove discussing our dreams. He later said it was one of the best visits he ever had with me. He knew nothing of "technique" but as a voracious reader his whole life his awareness of metaphor was sharp. I can hardly wait to discuss a dream my sister Anne sent me. It turns out that we have a mutually occurring scary dream that I'm certain has a common history that we can explore together. I know it will bring us closer. </p>

<p>The most important attitude I have learned while nursing the DNB is that dreams can be trusted to bear the truth. They will not maliciously fabricate metaphors that are meaningless or random. There is a message and the message has meaning. Generally my eyes are closed to myself and my life is like an iceberg. I am dumbly convinced that the 10% that I can see above the surface is all there is. Until I run aground on the other 90% under water!</p>

<p>There can be a danger to excessive dreamwork if it is an attempt to escape from waking life. If this happens, the dream images will point one back to life responsibilities and grounding activities. At least this was true with me. The more common problem is the <em>lack</em> of attention to inner life. </p>

<p>The personal healings within my family through dreamwork were accompanied by a gradual dissolving of distressing feelings of separation from other people and society in general. Feeling "separate" is one of the severest of social diseases of our time, one that can be helped through group study of the workings of the personal unconscious. Once last year when I was feeling disconnected from others I had a dream filled with images of family and friends, alive and deceased, that was so vivid I awoke literally shaking with joy. The only other place I have experienced such rapture was when I have surrendered my will up in prayer and felt wordless connection to all life... healed, safe, forgiven and whole. </p>

<p>Another element in dreamwork is the accompanying force for change. When I resist the nightly messages it is because I'm <em>afraid</em> to change, I want to hang on to my little neurotic securities. My ego does not go happily into sleep. I drag it there. In the hypnogogic stage before early sleep, conscious thought is released as another level of the mind steps forth. In my way of looking at things, that's where God speaks to me. My problem is that every night my timid definition of God is shattered once again. "How could a loving God give me such awful images?" "Why can't God be straightforward instead of metaphorical and speak verbally instead of in images?" I don't know. I only know that... [TO BE CONTINUED... MISSING PAGE NEEDS RESCANNING!] </p>

<p><img src="../images/joannapenn-article-img.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Dreaming The Soul Back Home"/></p>

<p><strong>They say the novel is ill.</strong> The novel is dying. The novel is dead. The fashionistas of literary criticism, many of them novelists themselves, condemn whatever current cultural phenomena they see threatening the novel’s mortality. The latest culprit is the Internet. With everyone able to publish without limitation, the guardians of quality are aghast. Still, more people are reading than ever before, and more people are writing as well. Maybe this is good. Too soon to tell. </p>

<p>One writer caught my eye recently. She’s self-publishing eBooks which have become Amazon best sellers and now has a print edition of her first novel available in the US and UK. As a result of her success, she has acquired a New York agent. Her web sites for helping authors navigate both creation in the digital world and marketing books and oneself on-line have been among the top-rated resources for writers for three-years running. She’s sparkly, vibrant and very much alive as are her books. After reading her ARKANE trilogy (<strong><em>Pentecost, Prophecy, Exodus</em></strong>), I decided to have a chat with Joanna Penn and she graciously agreed. She’s a Brit with a background in corporate information technology, psychology and religion, and a degree in theology from Oxford University. She’s been able to realize her dream of being a full-time writer and she loves it.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p><strong>Russ Lockhart.</strong> British accents mesmerize me, so if I go off into a trance you will know what is happening. I want you to know that I thoroughly enjoyed the ARKANE trilogy. I just devoured all three volumes. I have been reading a book called <strong><em>My Bookstore</em></strong>, with essays by 80 or so writers describing their experiences with bookstores that have played an important part in their becoming writers. Is there a bookstore in your background that played an important part in your becoming a writer? </p>

<p><strong>Joanna Penn.</strong> Absolutely. I love bookstores. Nowadays I read a lot of eBooks. But I still love to frequent bookstores. One that springs to mind is <strong><em>Blackwell’s</em></strong> in Oxford. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Ah, yes, a wonderful place. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I was a student there in the ‘90s. I used to hang out in the Norrington Room, which is downstairs. It’s a massive non-fiction area filled with religion, psychology, science, and travel books. I could just spend forever there. I used to spend all my money in Blackwell’s. I got so many books! And, I got to study at the Bodleian library as well which was marvelous. So, yes, print books definitely. Now I work in the London Library in central London and I go to Waterstone’s in Piccadilly, which is an amazing bookstore—six floors of books. [It’s Europe’s largest bookstore.] </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> So in spite of the fact that so many bookstores are closing—at least here in the U.S.—you have some hope for their survival? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> People want community around books. Bookstores that enable activities around books like writer’s groups and readings—those will survive and carry on. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> I’m glad to hear that. You’ve gone so deep into the new digital revolution that one wonders about the future of bookstores and also the future of libraries. Glad to hear that you see these places as not going away. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> It’s funny you should talk about this. One of the things I’m going to do, probably this year, is try my hand at making books. I’m going to a bookbinder and learn how to make limited hand-made editions for people who love my work. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> I’ll be very interested to follow what you do along these lines, as my wife and I have some experience in making books, from setting type, to making paper and binding. I don’t hear this idea of making books by hand much anymore. Such a wonderful thing to do. This is exciting! </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Yes, everything is so digital. I spend so much time with words I want to do something with my hands, something creative with my hands, to actually make something. I figure this is a good way! </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Tell me, Joanna, what have been the most important influences on you becoming a writer? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Probably the first writer that led me to feel this is what I want do was Umberto Eco, with <em>The Name of the Rose</em> and also <em>Foucault’s Pendulum</em>. Have you read those? </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Oh, yes. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I’ve always been interested in religion, and Eco showed me it was possible to write about religion in a fiction book. Trying to write like Umberto Eco obviously was not something I was going to do and that froze me up a bit. But then Dan Brown came along with The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons and this made me realize you could write fiction with religion, history, architecture, and archeology— deep and meaningful things—but in a fast-paced way that people would enjoy. Dan Brown helped me decide to write this way. Eco and Brown are two ends of a spectrum. I’m a massive reader and read very widely. In thrillers now, I like James Rollins. He writes from a religious angle. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Your ARKANE trilogy is certainly a thriller. The thriller is often described as “escapist” literature, a kind of distractive entertainment from the drudgery of everyday life. I’ve never been happy with this idea of escape. To me, fiction, no matter how great or poorly done, offers a portal of possibilities, an opening into possible worlds and has the potential of going deeper inside us then we often realize. Are you writing for people to escape or does your fiction have a deeper significance and purpose? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I have to say that when I started writing I had a job as an IT consultant. I really was miserable. Reading fastpaced thrillers was all about escape, about how to get out of this commute for 45 minutes before I get to my job and how to fill my lunch hour when I was really down. I’m lucky now. Since becoming a full-time author and entrepreneur, escape isn’t so necessary. But I want to write fiction on two levels, to make people think about deeper things and at the same time to have a really good ride. I will be writing more in my next series and think it is deeper than the ARKANE series. I‘m addressing some depth issues without trying to lecture people at the same time. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Harold Rosenberg, literary critic of <strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong>, back in 1975, expressed the hope and dream that everyone would be an artist, what he called one-person cultures. With the advent of digital publishing and the Internet as everyone’s stage, are we close to realizing Rosenberg’s dream, or are we falling into some potential nightmare? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I hope it’s not a nightmare. I like the sentiment that everyone can be an artist. I think that all children are artists and then we grow out of it and we push down the artistic tendencies. It took me 25 years to come back to it. I am self-published. I’m not a patient person. I think self-publishing my books made it possible for me. If I had to wait on traditional publishing, you would not have had my books. There are pros and cons with this new environment. I think, though, that if people want to express the stories inside they should be given a chance to get them out there. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Wordsworth long ago complained that the psyche was shut out because “the world was too much with us.” Can you imagine what he would say today when we are flooded by so much din and distraction? How is it amid this flood you can get yourself into the solitary space and time and place and energy where you can create, where you can write? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I’m an introvert. I make sure I have a place. When I had a day job I got up at 5. Now, I make sure I have silence. I have ear plugs. There is no music, no email, no logging on. I just set aside specific times to create. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> You titled your trilogy the ARKANE trilogy. There is a certain play on words, of course, because you bring a great deal of arcane knowledge into your writing. You are very deft at doing so. It never seems like filler. It’s not something where you turn the pages and skip over. I was thoroughly taken by the richness of the material you brought to bear on the development of the plot and the development of the characters. The history, the mythology, the religion, and the cultural aspects—it was wonderful. It is part of that sense I have that there are ways that fiction can bring in material that can seep into one, and into the popular culture, into collective consciousness, where ordinary non-fiction may have trouble doing so. You are doing that and I look forward to your new work that you say goes even deeper. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Thank you. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> But your ARKANE stands for “Arcane Religious Knowledge and Numinous Experience.” How did you come up with that? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I had this secret agency that investigates spiritual things located under Trafalgar Square. But I wanted to come up with a name for it, an acronym that meant something. I wanted to use arcane and I thought if I changed the “C” to “K” that would be cool. I’m glad you liked it, because a lot of people don’t get what “numinous” is. I wanted to go into all kinds of arcana as such. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> After reading the name the first time and what it meant it was clear you had an interest in Jung and archetypal psychology. How did you get interested in Jung? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> It was when I studied theology at Oxford. I wrote a paper on psychology of religion and of course Jung was one of the first psychologists I studied. I was particularly taken with Memories, Dreams, and Reflections. While I was writing Pentecost, Jung’s Red Book was published, his personal journal of breakdown and filled with images. It brought out all the things I had learned about Jung in the beginning of my studies and let me investigate him again. In his life story I found he had been in Tunisia and in America, and also in these places I write about. In the Red Book there was this painting of the Pentecost flame. That was amazing to me because as I was researching that whole synchronicity idea for the novel, it actually happened to me. What I love about writing these books is that as I research this stuff it seems almost to be true. I just tweak it a bit. It’s fiction, but it’s based on a whole load of facts. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> One of the things that impressed me was that you would bring in some fact that had just happened—like the story of Arafat’s poisoning—and mix it together with ancient arcane things. This brings together disparate things to create a meaning with a trajectory, not just some far out thing, but meaningful things that get through that aim beneath the surface. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> That Arafat story was synchronicity again. Just the other day, someone emailed me about a show on the Ark of the Covenant. People are always interested in these big archetypal stories. That was part of the reason for writing the books because I wanted resonance with the collective unconscious, the memory we have in our culture around these big religious questions. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Well, I think you are succeeding in a way that is very effective. I don’t think I would have devoured the books the way I did if this was not happening. To me it’s a good indicator of that “getting through” the surface into the deeper regions that I refer to as chief among the possibilities of fiction. You are really on the right track. </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Thank you for that. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> So far we’ve been talking about “dreams” in the sense of aspirations, a common usage I will be writing more about soon. But what about actual nighttime dreams? Do your dreams ever come into your work, or your work into your dreams? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I don’t record my dreams as in writing them down when I wake up. I definitely dream richly and I have nightmares. I have quite a dark mind, as you will have found in my books with all those violent deaths and horror aspects. I think the supernatural can be horrific. I like the shadow idea and I like going into the darker side of us and I do sometimes dream very violent dreams. Sometimes, I worry that when people read my books that they think that’s me; that I am into violence and death. But part of what’s great about writing is that writing about these dark things helps us reconcile these darker issues. In fact, writers like Stephen King and James Herbert and hopefully me are actually more psychologically normal because we can tackle horror in our work. What do you think? </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> I couldn’t agree more, Joanna. This leads to the next question. Your heroine, Dr. Morgan Sierra, seems modeled somewhat on one Joanna Penn. Is this an example of the old saw, “Write what you know?” Or, is something else involved? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> The author wants to have an experience through her creation. Now Morgan is kick-ass, ex-Israeli military, which I am not. She’s like my superhero alter ego, I suppose. I certainly love writing her story. I like writing a strong female aspect. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> In the documentary, Bergman’s Island, Ingmar Bergman says that before he writes a screenplay or a stage play an image seizes him. Sometimes it’s from a dream, sometimes from a childhood memory, sometimes from something he encounters on the street. He can’t get these out of his mind until he relates to them seriously and begins writing from them. You will remember the iconic scene from the Seventh Seal where death and the knight meet on the beach and play chess. This scene developed from a childhood memory. Bergman had seen a small painting up in the lofty ceiling of a church where a dark figure and a knight were playing chess. Do you experience this? Does something grip you and that becomes the basis? Or do you plan out, outline, and write from there? How does it go? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Oh, the idea or image comes first exactly as you say. I am a very visual person. A lot of my writing comes from the places I’ve been—Israel in particular. I’ve been eleven times. A lot of my passion for these topics comes from things I’ve seen in Israel and other places. Also when I’m researching, things really happen! For example, Pentecost was originally called Mandala and was even more about Jung. Then I was in St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice. I looked up and saw the Pentecost in those golden mosaic stones and this changed the whole book for me. That image. I had the idea for the stones. And then I saw the flame coming from the stones in Jung’s painting. This happens to me all the time. The other day I saw on a billboard a man with an octopus tattoo up his back and this image was seared into my mind. I wrote the scene yesterday in my new book. The man has become a woman with the octopus tattoo and she’s become a whole new character. I plot around the images. And then I do research and find nuggets that help to make it more real for readers. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> It’s quite an adventure for you! </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> I’m so pleased to be able to do this full time. I love the research. Last year I went to Budapest to research another book. Budapest is chock full of horrific stories of the past, what happened to Jews and all kinds of horrible things that would be brilliant in a book. I love this kind of traveling, researching, writing life. I am a very happy writer. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> What about your new work? </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Well, it’s a new series and new characters. Before that, there will be a new ARKANE book. This one will be on the Kabala and the Spanish Inquisition. That will be ARKANE number 4 and will come out later in 2013. And then next, a novella as well about Hungary. </p>

<p><strong>RL.</strong> Can’t wait. Thank you, Joanna.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p><strong>JP.</strong> Thank you for having me, Russell. </p>

<p>The crucial aspect of dreamwork to me is its personal, humane approach. Our dreams help us to understand ourselves and relate to others, they enrich our lives from the inside out. There's a lot of extraneous psychobabble that can be discarded. No Ph.D. is required to understand that dream messages usually explain our feelings about our day to day lives. These can be felt and shared. </p>

<p>What excites me about my dream group is the personal sharing that results from the careful exchange of dreams. My own help me reach into myself and out to others. They encourage me to feel included in the Universal Mind. My intellect tends to say, "This part of me, that part of me," but in my dreams, all "parts" are aspects of a psychic family. In the same way, individuals are "parts," but only intellectually. Actually we are on the same evolutionary path toward the recollection of our natural wholeness. </p>

<p>Dreams are things we share in common - they are "safe" because the message is veiled in symbology. Sharing a dream message about feeling scared is easier than saying "I feel scared" to a group in a room. Dreams also seem to "happen" to us, even though we usually create them.</p>

<p>I have a vision of a network of dream hotlines, where listeners could receive calls from people who wanted to understand their dream message. It could be a one to one interview method, anonymous unless the caller wanted to join the larger network. Then they would pay dues and be entitled to newsletters and meetings. They could become listeners themselves. </p>

<p>The most serious problem facing people is the separation we feel from our selves and one another. This manifests in the social attitude of "every man for himself" and damaging competitiveness. We all long for community and family. If we look deeply into our dreams, this common thread becomes evident. It cuts through all the red tape in relationships.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>According to a front page article in the July 1988 <em>New York Times</em>, an estimated 12 to 15 million North Americans are members of self-help organizations. This number has doubled in the last 10 years and includes roughly 500,000 separate organizations. The article, by Patricia Leigh Brown, goes on to define a self-help group as: "one in which people who face a common concern or condition come together voluntarily for emotional support and practical assistance. They generally meet without professional supervision, though they may draw upon professional expertise". Brown quotes numerous sources describing the "worldwide phenomenon" of these groups, which are partly inspired by the Alcoholics Anonymous movement begun in the 1930s. </p>

<p>Dream groups are a growing part of this awakening giant of mutual aid. People who believe dreams are meaningful need a safe place to share and understand their dreams. There are a large number of people who believe that dreams have only neurological or biological meaning, as well as an even larger number who aren't sure or don't care. I personally am convinced that all my dreams have meaning and I want to understand what that meaning is. What concerns me is how to get together with people who feel similarly, because my dreams are complex, need a social context to reveal themselves, and I frequently can't see beyond my own nose, while someone else can. </p>

<p>The following are ten of many good reasons why I encourage people to form or join dream groups, based on my own belief &amp; experience:  </p>

<h3>Kindred Spirits:</h3>

<p>I need to be in a group that values dreams and believes as I do, that dreams are meaningful and have practical healing value on many levels.  </p>

<h3>Inexpensive:</h3>

<p>These groups are either free or relatively inexpensive, especially compared to therapy.  </p>

<h3>Not therapy:</h3>

<p>With the emphasis on helping the dreamer with his or her dream, there is no focus on interpersonal relationships in the group, as in group therapy.  </p>

<h3>No ideological pressures:</h3>

<p>In therapy, the training or bias of the therapist (often unspoken) will flavor the attitude toward dream work.  </p>

<h3>More attention to the dream:</h3>

<p>In therapy, there is a 50 minute hour, much of which is allotted to discussing the emotional life of the client; time is too precious to 'waste' all of it over discussion of dream material. </p>

<h3>No hierarchy:</h3>

<p>The group is egalitarian; the facilitator doesn't have to be a clinically trained therapist who is "doing" therapy and responsible for the emotional needs of any individual or the group. The facilitator also shares dreams.</p>

<h3>Dreamer controlled process:</h3>

<p>The dreamer controls the level of disclosure and is under no pressure to reveal more than s/he is comfortable with in the group. The dreamer is assisted in coming to an interpretation for him or herself.  </p>

<h3>Socializing:</h3>

<p>Dream groups are an exceptional way to meet people and make friends, as opposed to the "problematic" nature of seeking psychotherapy or analysis. (Try inviting your therapist to dinner, and see what happens!)  </p>

<h3>Generalize-ability:</h3>

<p>The skills learned in dream groups may be used and taught to spouses, friends, children. No formal training is necessary to become more fluent in the language of dreams.  </p>

<h3>Pleasurable:</h3>

<p>We spend so much of our time wearing the persona of our different roles in our relationships at work, home, and socializing, that it's pleasurable to "strip down" and share more of our deeper selves in a safe environment with others. There's something intangible that happens in that environment; sharing &amp; helping are brave, human acts that cause us to feel more connected to others and feel better inside. </p>

<p>There are a host of other therapy related issues that are avoided in the setting of the non-therapist facilitated dream group, but in my mind there is one that stands out: self-empowerment. You can easily start your own group if there are none available locally or you don't like the "feel" of what's available in your area. Especially beware of therapist-led groups in which the leader insists one "has to be a therapist to do this": That is a tip-off that it's going to be dreamwork and therapy. There are many therapists who have successfully removed their therapists' hat and led such groups; but in general, experts don't like to be co-opted. Professional therapists serve functions that cannot be fulfilled by dream groups and vice-versa. I'm in therapy and find it very rewarding, but in my dream group, I feel I get the best help with my dreams.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, would you describe for me what it is that you do with dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I do dreamwork with individuals, teach and give presentations at bookstores, community college, conferences and at the Dream House in San Francisco, and write articles and columns for dream-related publications. I have been involved in several networking activities such as the "Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers Group" (which Fred Olsen and I co-founded); the "Seth Dream Network" (for which I served as coordinator); the "Association for the Study of Dreams (as membership chairperson); and as a co-chairperson for the "Dream Educators' Network". Also, for the past three years, I have facilitated an international lucid group dreaming experiment called "The Lucidity Project". </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6magai2-0.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Linda Magallon"/></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Linda Magallón</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Do you find time to keep your dream journals and to do your own dreamwork? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, yes, definitely! A dreamworker is first of all a dreamer. I must admit a bias. I find it very difficult to understand dreamworkers who do not keep journals or pay attention to their own dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What methods of dreamwork do you use? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Being an eclectic, I like to experiment with many different methods: first with myself, then with my family and finally with the public. My three favorites are Fred Olsen's Waking Dream Re-Entry and Relmaging method which is a Jungian active imagination technique; Gayle Delaney's Dream Definition Analysis method which clarifies personal symbols; and Fritz Perls' Gestalt method which incorporates dialoguing with dream symbols and characters. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Have you always recalled your dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I can remember that as a child I had nightmares which often ended with Mafioso types clutching at my ankles as I tried to fly away. However, my first love was not dreams but rather imagination because I could control the scenario. This lasted until March 8, 1982, when I had my first lucid dream. That life-changing dream lead me into dreamwork. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> It sounds as though you moved very quickly from a strong interest in dreams to active involvement with the dreamworker community. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> From the onset I was really very interested in the way in which dreams fit into the context of society. So I very purposely sought out other dreamers and dreamworkers. For example, after I read the book, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, I wrote the author, <a href="../@jeancampbell">Jean Campbell</a>. When she wrote back, we began correspondence that culminated in friendship. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> You mentioned that as a child you preferred fantasizing over dreaming because of the element of control. And now you are an avid and frequent lucid dreamer who enjoys varying degrees of control within the dream state. How would you respond to someone who is concerned about the effects or applications of control within a dream? </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6magai2-1.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Linda Magallon"/></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Linda Magallón</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Lucidity brings you to the point of being aware that you are dreaming. That is a point of decision. You could choose to be very manipulative or completely passive. What you choose to do can be quite revealing when you compare it with how you usually act in the waking state. </p>

<p>To me the dream is powerful, wise and self-regulating. I don't have to worry about over-controlling my dream because when I start doing that, my dream characters turn around and give me a bad time. the trick is to befriend the dream, to develop a cooperative relationship. </p>

<p>I have many different types of dreams other than lucid dreams which give me the opportunity to dwell in the dream in a more passive role. All kinds of dreams can bring me knowledge and guidance. </p>

<p>One other thing that I would say is that it is my belief that some people use their dreams primarily as a pressure valve. If I am taking care of business in the waking state, I don't have to rely upon dreams to straighten me out. This frees me up to look at dreams in other ways, to approach them like creative compositions, neat little movies or explorations of consciousness. These other ways are therapeutic and beneficial as well because I awaken from them with my self-esteem lifted and my spirits high.</p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, in addition to regarding you as a resource on dream lucidity, I also regard you as a resource on dream telepathy. Would you tell me how you know when a dream is telepathic and whether or not you do dreamwork with a telepathic dream? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I do a fair amount of checking with other people for correlations and that is the usual way that I discover that a particular dream is telepathic. Of course, it's easier if I have incubated a telepathic dream. Those times when a symbol just seems to drop in from out of nowhere are the times when I suspect that I am borrowing symbolic shorthand from someone else, especially if I identify that person in my dream.</p>

<p>A telepathic dream, like any other, can be viewed as meaningful metaphor for the dreamer. The dreamer is ultimately responsible for his or her own dream. If the dream is telepathic, the dreamer can ask "Why did I attract that information? Why am I picking that up?" </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Before you became immersed in the dream profession, did you hold positions in other fields? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, yes. I hold a Masters in Business Administration and have taught in public schools from the elementary to the college level. I've worked in business, social service agencies, government and in career counseling. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> How does this background affect you now as a dreamworker?</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> The wide variety of careers that I have had enables me to deal with the whole spectrum of the dream community, from the avid dreamers to the academicians and clinicians. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> One of my concerns is how the dream community can minimize factionalism between these two groups. What would you recommend? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> In my view, dreamwork is as multi-layered as the dreams themselves. The best benefit for the dream community is to acknowledge and encourage the entire range of dreamwork from clinical research to personal application. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> That reminds me of your idea of the dreamwork community as having "a lot of stars". </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Exactly. Since most dreamworkers have survived in a vacuum, they have had to be very self sufficient. They are strongly individual. Of course, all of this diversity means that there is more flavoring to the pot. The trick is to pull together enough to make what could be called a movement out of it. My hunch is that if the dream movement can piggy-back on the self-help movement, it will take off. </p>

<p>One of the issues facing dreamworkers today is how to be considered legitimate. Those of us who do not have degrees after our names, want validity without necessarily coming under rigid structure and rules. Those of us who do have degrees, want to be considered legitimate by the scientific and psychological communities and by the sources for research funding. I think that one of the solutions to this quest for legitimacy is simply for dream information and dreamwork to be made widely available to the public. <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em> can help. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Linda, what are the goals for <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em> under your editorship? </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> First off, I would like to say that I intend to keep the basic format the same. I give a lot of credit to the former editors, the people who work behind the scenes (like co-editor <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a>) and to the subscribers for putting together an excellent periodical that serves as a forum for the entire dreamwork community. </p>

<p>My goals for the Bulletin are to build up the readership base; to encourage the academicians to submit hardcore informative articles in readable English; and to add more artwork, interviews and humor to the menu. I would also like to see some pro/con articles and more letters to the editor. Contributions are welcome. Everyone is invited to dream up new ideas for <em>DNB</em>.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>De Chirico's paintings come from dimensions of awareness that our kinds of understanding are only imperfect derivatives of. Yet the paintings speak to us, loudly, deeply. They mysteriously transport us to nuances of comprehension not readily grasped or expressed in the ways we have been schooled to be limited to. In this sense they are not unlike our own dreams. could this be because they are our own dreams? I think so. The visions that de Chirico was able to express with such genius on canvas are not unique to him. It is our own deepest stirrings that he has brought before us. His paintings are mirrors of our own minds and souls, How much we can see in them is contingent upon how well we can know what is happening in ourselves. So they may convey quite different messages to different individuals, depending on how far along on the path to self-realization each is. Which message is real? Of course it's the one you feel the strongest that's most real for you. </p>

<p>In our commercial culture art is mistakenly confused with the objects produced by artists. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Art is a mode of perception. The objects or paintings themselves are only ancillary. Yet they are essential to the process just as it is essential for me to put my impressions of these paintings into writing. Anything I can say about de Chirico's paintings is only what some part of me already knows but putting it into words liberates me by bringing this awareness to areas of my mind that aren't privy to this kind of knowing and thus causing them to release their restrictive hold on my natural unfolding. sounds like working with dreams? It is. </p>

<p>Let me emphasize that I know nothing of de Chirico, nothing of painting, and certainly nothing of art criticism. It's the ways we have been taught to approach the art of the masters that kill the process in us all. I am fortunately unburdened by these. The three paintings I have chosen to write about are done scant justice by the photographs reproduced here. De Chirico's paintings don't work in black and white. To miss the color is to miss the meaning. But color paintings are prohibitively expensive to reproduce accurately. These black and white pictures of his paintings still convey the sense of something like dimly remembered dreams, but that "something" itself is gone. I urge our readers to attend this spectacular exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. What this man is saying on canvas and what dreamwork is about are the same thing.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-0.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="The Joy of Return"/></p>

<h2>The Joy of Return</h2>

<p>We live in a world of gray facades flying their black sperm flags of a false fertility, but they are no longer anything but facades. we can see through them, especially at the top. The machines have becomes the center of our world. We are alone, colorless, going to the somewhere that is nowhere to go. But there is a light behind the machine, there is something dawning behind the facades. There is a hope behind all of this bleakness. We can see through all this we know there is something brighter; the dawning of a post-industrial mentality. The man's head isn't on straight. He is each of us. De Chirico entitles this painting "The Joy of Return". What is returning is the light in the sky. It's dawn. It heralds the end of the night that our kind of consciousness and civilization has been for the human soul. It announces the dawn of a new age, a new way of being. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-1.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="The Seer"/></p>

<h2>The Seer</h2>

<p>Creativity is the key. The maker is the made. The artist is the work of art, sitting squarely on his pedestal. It is himself that he is working on. Self-tailored, still incompletely formed: a human, yet a dummy. How deformed are we who create, how powerless of limb. Yet how beautiful, erect, noble. How dead our heads are: deaf and dumb and blind to the inner vision that is burning brightly within us like a star. Could it be that we have to let go of all that our senses have been trained to see and hear and taste, and all that our arms and hands have been trained to touch and feel? Certainly these trained systems are like so many trained monkeys seeing only what they have been taught. Relinquishing all that, we feel a different kind of sight emerging within us. we become the seer. The eye we see with is inside of us. It is the third eye, the eye of enlightened vision. This painting shows our predicament as creators. We have distanced ourselves from our blackboard of mental constructs, and even more so from the massive structure of our civilization. We are in a bare room that is no room at all but opens out into the infinite. It's only out of this emptiness that a new world can be born. Only by owning our creativity will the new human emerge within each of us. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6master-2.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="The Transformed Dream"/></p>

<h2>The Transformed Dream</h2>

<p>An exploration of nuance and mood is what this painter's work is all about, the nuance of subtle metaphysical perception, the stuff of dreams brought to waking perception. The dream we are living is our culture - the heritage of past knowledge, the remains of the great men and thinkers. This dead dream of industrialized architecture that the thinking mind has constructed all around us is transformed with the more delicate substance that comes from within us, not just from night dreams but from altered states of perception that move from them into our waking life - ephemeral things, these modalities, luscious and fresh like a banana, bountiful and ripe like a whole copious stalk of bananas, aromatic and delicious like the prickly pineapple with its teasing promise of sweetness. The past we've constructed all around us is transformed by these newly emergent modalities of perception. </p>

<p>The dreams we have dreamt into reality all around us are dead substance but become transformed when we open up to the continued unfolding of this dream which places its precious bounty on the altar of the reality that we worship and is its only legitimate compliment. Our world - that empty parade of forms like the ruins of some dead civilization becomes transformed. To dream and to become: only this will populate our world with the life that is the most precious and exotic food for our souls. Only this makes everything else beautiful and fitting. Only this brings life into what all around us is dead. </p>

<p>If art such as de Chirico's is invaluable it is only because it brings us closer to what is happening within us all. His genius mirrors our own. We can't all be great painters like him but we are all - yes, every one of us - great dreamers. And each of us, to do justice to this great dream emerging from within us, must struggle to find his own ways to bring it to the light of day as de Chirico did. Only in this way, and in no other, can we save a world that has grown dead and gray.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I dreamt that most of my front teeth had fallen out. I held them in my hand and looked up into the mirror at my toothless mouth. Horrified beyond measure. it suddenly struck me, "Hold on! This might just be a dream."</p>

<p>"If it is a dream," I reasoned with myself, "then I can fly because in dreams I can fly." Whereupon, remembering how I had done it in previous dreams, I looked down at the floor and, sure enough. with some kind of intentional energy I caused myself to lift up off the floor. I flew right out of that nightmare into a wonderful odyssey of different dreams and adventures that seemed to last throughout the night. I awoke in the morning wonderfully refreshed, feeling I had visited another reality. I had had my first major lucid dream. </p>

<p>Ever since l read Patricia Garfield's <em>Creative Dreaming</em> years ago I had been trying unsuccessfully to dream lucidly. It happened a few nights after THE DREAM COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK had a preliminary meeting with Bill Surgio with regard to the lucid dream machine we are going to test out for him. This illustrates an interesting paradox of human nature. The individual functions at his creative best when part of a group. Individual dreamwork, which the best dreamwork must be, progresses most rapidly when one is working on a regular basis with a dream group. For this reason we have taken it upon ourselves to publicize existing dream groups as they come to our attention. If you know of any that are not listed below or if you are forming one yourself please let us know so we may include it in future issues of our newsletter.</p>

  <p><em>I dream that a conventional appearing middle class woman is calmly and confidently shooting two young lovers with a rifle. She shoots the young woman point blank and then turns the rifle on the young man who stands there horrified as he is shot to death. She is standing in the shadow of the roof of one of those concessions that lined the Boardwalk of Coney Island near where I lived as a child. I can’t see into the room, but by its dimensions this might have been an amusement gallery, the kind with the fortuneteller doll in a glass case in the center who will hand you a paper fortune for a penny or a nickel.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Having killed the lovers, she turns her rifle toward me, where I am watching from about a hundred yards away across the Boardwalk. She wants to silence me, to prevent me from writing about the extraordinary intelligence—and the plight—of the Elephant People. In the dream, my essays are being reprinted and becoming influential. I manage to escape her by fleeing to the Boardwalk entrance ramps where I meet Ron Kovic, the Vietnam veteran antiwar activist whose own story is told in “Born on the Fourth of July.” We greet one another, having been in the anti-war movement at the same time.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Suddenly, I am with him in a small room. He is not in his wheelchair but is standing. I am standing with him and we are embracing each other as comrades. He has healed almost all of his wounds in the course of these years. And he is still Ron Kovic standing up for what he believes.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6meleph-1.jpg" width=500 height="auto"/></p>

<p>I write down the dream and then learn that there was a showing of “Born on the Fourth of July” at the Museum of Modern Art on July 5th, 2012. Alexander Reed Kelley wrote about the event in Truthdig, on July 19th <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/speaking-truth-on-the-fifth-of-july/">http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/speaking<em>truth</em>on<em>the</em>fifth_ of<em>july</em>20120819/</a>. There is a scene in “Born on the Fourth of July” where Kovic, played by Tom Cruise, and a small group of veterans enter the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My name is Ron Kovic. I am a Vietnam veteran,” Kovic says as he attempts to stand up from his wheelchair. “I am here to say that this war is wrong, that this society lied to me. It lied to my brothers. It deceived the people of this country, tricked them into going 13,000 miles to fight a war against a poor peasant people…” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the film, speaking to the audience, Kovic said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s a chill in the air. People are intimidated. … Protest is supposed to be part of our constitutional right and our freedom of assembly, the freedom to question authority and the freedom to redress our grievances, which we saw during the Occupy movement… Since 9/11, those who protest are almost made to feel as if they’re the enemy. …They’re afraid of being called traitors and being called un-American,” as Kovic himself has been called continuously, since speaking out against the wars, while sitting in his wheelchair, bearing wounds he sustained while attempting to defend his nation. “I think one of the most American things you can do is to speak your mind, to gather on a street corner and express yourself.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As in the dream, it is easy to pick off individuals one at a time, but perhaps the gathering of minds is a different matter. </p>

<p>Kelley’s article hits home. I was preparing to lead a writing retreat among the ancient stones and megaliths of Ireland, and had just read of the defeat of the Druids by the Romans.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The power of the Druids was so feared by the Romans that in 60 CE, their legions… made the crossing to the island of the dreamers and began the destruction of the sacred groves… With great effort the Roman governor, Suetonius Paulinus, rallied his men to attack this “band of females and fanatics… The next step… was to demolish the groves consecrated to their savage cults. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long these wars against the innocents have been going on! </p>

<p>The conventional woman in my dream has no difficulty killing the innocents; it is what she does, just as the militarists have been engaged in endless war for millennia. It is how things have been and it is what must be undone. We know that consciousness is real and so we can change and reintegrate ourselves into the ecology of creation. Why else would spirit have sent this dream at this time? </p>

<p>The woman aims at me with her rifle because I stand with the Elephant People. Let us not imagine for a moment that the aerial war against the wolves, the hunting by helicopter of elephants and rhinos, the conscription of dolphin into suicide missions, the devastation of the forests, the sacred groves, the mountains, the waters, air and land, the contamination of Mars with plutonium, the requisitioning of aboriginal lands and their resources everywhere, are not the same as the horrific acts of war we have witnessed and are living through in this and the last centuries against all the different peoples of this earth. </p>

<p>In the dream, I meet the violence and probably save my life by making an alliance with an elder anti-war activist. After a long common history, we still stand together. </p>

<p>Why this dream at this time, I asked and then looked for Ron’s recent activities, not even knowing if he is alive. Then I found the article about the talk he had just given. </p>

<p>In the dream, anti-war is anti-war. A No Enemy Way. At Daré, on Sunday, the 19th, a woman told a story of an old ghost in the attic of a church who asked for help cleaning up a mess. She knew it was his mess that he needed to clean. He had caused her family injury. She resented having to help. But when a ghost wants help in cleaning up the past… </p>

<p>I remember a line from a play I saw many years ago. The identity of a former Nazi officer living incognito among French resistance members is uncovered. Their intention is to kill him in retribution. “Hate the deed, but not the man,” he pleas for his own life. </p>

<p>The No-Enemy way is committed to undoing war without engaging in war. We will have to be so very clever, determined and dedicated to clean up the grand mess. We will have to do it together. Many of the peoples on the planet, like the Wolf People, the Elephant People, the Tree People, cannot defend themselves just as indigenous people have ultimately been unable to defend themselves against the warmongers over the years. And yet the planet must not die. </p>

<p>I met Ron Kovic in my dream last night. He stood up and I stood up next to him. Today, Day 119 before 2012, a dream calls me to stand up with / for the young lovers of the world, the Elephant People, and ‘the others,’ that is, for ourselves. ∞</p>

  <p><strong>Apokalypsis:</strong> (from the Greek) literally "revelation" or "a tearing away of the veil, of that which conceals" (kalyptein)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enantiodromia:</strong> The qualities or personas, carried to their extremes, tend to become their opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Editorial preface: When Michael and I were setting up this interview, I mentioned the shocking similarity of the dreams Michael built his book, 'Dreaming the End of the World' around and those received on this end as a result of our call for visionary dreams -resulting in this year's theme, Dreaming Humanity's Path. Similarity sufficient to cause trembling! This phenomenon, for me, confirms the essential message/story Psyche is communicating to the human community in these times.</em></p>

<p><strong>Roberta Ossana:</strong> Before we go into the heart of the crucial dreams and messages that you communicate in your book about them, will you share a little about yourself, your interest in dreams/especially dreams of apocalypse, and how the book came about?</p>

<p><strong>Michael Ortiz Hill:</strong> My background and education have definitely not been traditional. My mother is an artist and Mexican; her family goes back 250 years in Santa Fe, New Mexico My father was a Buddhist/Jungian intellectual. They met in the artist community in Santa Fe back in the 40's... so, I grew up in a certain ferment around artistic and psychic concerns. The beginning of my education was in my father's library, for sure! I was raised Catholic and learned the Buddha Dharma from my father when I was 15.</p>

<p>My own practice has been largely Buddhist. When I was a teenager, I was homeless for three years and I regard that period as the real ground of my education: on one hand it was three years sleeping under freeway bridges, rummaging through garbage cans; on the other hand, I sat in on classes at the university, spending a great deal of time reading in university libraries. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell were certainly my mentors. When I was homeless, a great deal of what I did was get an education. It was very deep, very rigorous and actually very devastating...  as one can imagine. What I call the apocalyptic rite of passage was first enacted in my life when I was on the street.</p>

<p>I rather reconstructed myself when I was in my twenties. Got a job working with dying people and began to piece myself together. I trained as a registered nurse and entered into a quasi-monastic Buddhist practice for 6 1/2 years, sitting zazen at the bedside of my patients during graveyard shift. So my work now is what I call curandeeismo, a Spanish word meaning that I do healing, both in the context of the hospital and doing ritual work with my wife, Deena Metzger. Dreams play a big part in all of this. I work very strongly with dreams with my patients/clients, also with the Tarot and doing ritual work. My training the last three years has been in Ifa, which is West African (Yoruba) religious tradition. That's my life in a nutshell.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6mhilli-1.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="Deena Metzger &amp; Michael Ortiz Hill"/></p>

<p>The dreams that I've collected for the book are about the end of the world, about apocalypse. Because I'm from New Mexico, originally and because of the circumstances of my background, I literally grew up under the shadow of the bomb. My father was born and raised at Alamogordo, which is where they blew up the first bomb... outside of town, there. And my mother's town, Santa Fe is very much in the shadow of Los Alamos.</p>

<p>My mother tells a remarkable story about when she was a teenager in the early forties, walking on the ridge near my grandfather's ranch with a nephew and pointing to the lights of Los Alamos—not having a clue what they were doing over there—and telling him that that was Santa Claus preparing Christmas for everybody!</p>

<p>So, I grew up within the mythology of the bomb, within the duck and cover generation. The terrors of the cold war were always an over-arching presence. I'm of a generation—the post Hiroshima generation—that truly did not believe we would live to be 20 years old. I grew up in an atmosphere that took apocalypse as a given.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> An extraordinary history, Michael. Thank you. It seems to me that the dreams and your narrative in the book, are re-telling or reframing the archetypal motifs of the Creation Story and Hero's Journey, in contemporary terms. Does this ring true for you?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> That's a very good point because one of the startling things is, if you look at the roots of what is called apocalypse in Western culture... if you look, for instance, to the roots of the Gospel and the revelations of St. John about apocalypse in the Old Testament, you go back to the old Babylonian stories of Marduk and the slaying of the primordial dragon, Tiamat. An ordered Universe, the sky and the stars, comes from the body of the slain dragon.</p>

<p>So, the story of apocalypse, at its root, is really the story of creation...not the story of the end of the world. It's the story of the end of one world and the beginning of another. So, you're absolutely right about that. </p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> That's how this time seems, like an updating of the Creation story and being on the threshold of creation. Let's hope! It can't get too much more chaotic.</p>

<p>There are some quotes from your book that orchestrate these archetypal stories—and which also outline the three stages of the Hero's Journey—which I would like to frame this interview around, if I may:</p>

<h2>DEPARTURE</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"This dream—the (collective) Dream at the End of the World—is the awakening of the Beast."</em> p.23</p>
  
  <p><em>"The Beast is an autonomous complex loose in the collective psyche..."</em> p.33</p>
  
  <p><em>"The Beast is very often associated with the realm under the ground."</em> p.25</p>
  
  <p><em>"Very often the Beast's violence is located specifically in its hunger."</em> p.25</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> What are some alternative, constructive suggestions you might make... what can be done to satisfy the hunger of the beast?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> There are two things that come to mind. One, I suppose has to do with my reflections on the beast the last few months. My wife and I have been talking about the vortex—our shorthand for this acceleration of time we're experiencing. Deena and I have been talking about this autonomous complex, this vortex, that we're drawn into and toward—where things just seem to speed up and speed up and speed up—and more and more is demanded of us and we try to keep pace with it and things literally start disintegrating around us. The feeling is that when you find all of your peers and most everything you see around you being drawn toward this acceleration, then there is more going on than a personal situation.</p>

<p>When I was his student years ago, Llama Sogyul Rimpoche used to talk about the Kali Yuga. Kali, is of course, the devouring mother from Tibetan and North Indian mythology. The Kali Yuga being the apocalyptic age, he used to speak of it in terms of a time of things accelerating and therefore disintegrating. So, in terms of the hunger of the Beast, there is way in which we are feeding our lives, our very selves, to this particular vortex. Lately, I've been struggling to re-imagine the vortex as a relentless demand to seize the present moment, carpe diem, to serve the sacredness of what is immediately present.</p>

<p>The other thing about feeding the Beast is that the passage through apocalypse is hopefully a passage to a much smaller and humbler way of seeing things. There's a big attraction to thinking apocalyptically...in enormous categories. There's a shift, it seems to me, between the Beast (with a capital B) and the animals. There's the little kangaroo rat that you see the track of in the desert. That's the shift to me, in terms of archetypically feeding the Beast. How do you "feed"—that is to say acknowledge and nurture—the world it lives in? The real question is, What is the Transition We Have to Make? so that we're weaned from these heroic, titanic battles between Messiah and Beast and come back to seeing the little particulars that surround us.</p>

<h2>INITIATION</h2>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> So when we're talking about an autonomous complex loose in the collective psyche and how we might satisfy the Beast's hunger...it seems to boil down to the individual and to a recognition of shadow, leading to the rite of passage or the Initiatory stage of the Journey. More quotes from your book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"The Messiah, crazy in his desire to eliminate the enemy, easily becomes the Beast."</em> p. 31</p>
  
  <p><em>"In this dream, (at the end of the world) Beast and Messiah co-habit the same image."</em> p. 42</p>
  
  <p><em>"It is in coming to terms with the reality of the Beast that our salvation lies."</em> p. 44</p>
  
  <p><em>"Sub-scending the madness of the 20th century means descending into the Underworld to be initiated there."</em> p. 45</p>
  
  <p><em>"The dream of apocalypse depends on descending into the Beast's lair with tenderness of heart..."</em> p. 44</p>
  
  <p><em>"Rather than enacting apocalypse in the world unconsciously, we deliberately enter the apocalypse of the psyche for the sake of the world."</em> p.53</p>
  
  <p><em>"We are far more likely to participate in the world's destruction by clinging to the fiction of our innocence than if we have a conscious and living relationship with the darker aspects of our own nature."</em> p. 53</p>
  
  <p><em>"...apocalyptic initiation may well require destruction; one's 'world falling apart' can be intrinsic to the way of transformation."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"The recognition of apocalypse begins with looking into the face of what is falling apart and finding it unbearable..."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"...the project of preserving the fiction of normality in an apocalyptic time is itself the opium of the masses."</em> p. 85</p>
  
  <p><em>"These dreams speak of the end of denial, both of what is going on and of our complicity in it."</em> p. 99</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> In these quotes, Beast and the Jungian concept of Shadow—or that which is not yet conscious—are relative, almost synonymous, are they not?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Yes, I think so, although when I speak of the Beast I'm talking about Shadow in a collective way... though obviously it's very personal, very intimately personal. When we speak of what we don't even want to know about ourselves, that's about as intimate as you can get.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> If Shadow has become a collective, autonomous complex, how do we each begin to do the work of withdrawing (shadow) projections? Of befriending the Beast?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> There's an initiation in looking the Beast in the eye and our transformation is literally in the arms of the Beast, so to speak. There's a recognition of the sacred here. What happens in the apocalyptic battle is that there's a raging between the Messiah and the Beast that feeds this energy and that is precisely what we have to withdraw from. It's not about fighting the Beast, it's about recognizing: Ah...I See! It's not the enemy "out there" that's trying to destroy the world. I myself am also participating.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Therein lies the paradox and the beauty in comprehending these realities. While the Beast is becoming visible—e.g. while we have collectively projected our shadow-side out into the world via wholesaling/marketing violence, via—as you speak about so eloquently in your book—the ravages that we're visiting upon Nature...the Beast has become so BIG! Yet each of us can only do our part, our own work. Can you, having been through the rites of passage many times yourself, offer courage and encouragement to people who have yet to make that passage?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Courage is a wonderful word, I think, because—as I understand the root of the word—courage is about coure, heart. How do we have heart?</p>

<p>Somebody was asking me what apocalypse actually was, psychologically and as I got to the core of it, I believe it's the image of heartbreak. I think our terrors of apocalypse are terrors of heartbreak, of things falling apart. Psychological apocalypse is the experience of the lament or the rage or the compassion of living in the world at this time. And it is heart breaking, it is terrifying in many respects. That part of it can't be diminished, can't be pretended away.</p>

<p>One classicist I quote in the book, L. R. Farnell, says that the quality that Hades holds—Hades being the God at the bottom of the underworld—in his primordial self is tenderness and melancholy.</p>

<p>My own experience in making this passage—for all the drama of going down, which can indeed be very excruciating at times—the bottom line of the experience is this quality of tenderness and melancholy. I work a great deal around the Greek myth of Hades and the Eleusinian mysteries and I always ask, "What will it require to change the hell of the Twentieth Century into a Hades of initiation, rather than look at this time as a period or place of damnation? What if we look at the particulars of living in this time as a rite of initiation?"</p>

<p>Initiation always serves the life energy and the life energy is the vitality within us and that is reliable. To move in that direction, to recover a portion of one's vitality, is a profound act.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, American culture is a fundamentalist culture in many respects. It proliferates fundamentalisms and about 80% of what passes as ethics in this country is about identifying an enemy and throwing one's life force into fighting it! It's better than not being ethically committed, I suppose but there's very little imaginative space for what might be an ethics of reconciliation. When I work on the dream level, the question is, "How does one apply an ethics of reconciliation? How does one reconcile oneself with these aspects that are hugely troublesome, disruptive and confusing?" One can rely on the ego psychology that fights them to the bitter end but we all know that, in itself, drives us crazy.</p>

  <p><em>"These dreams show that the Beast may well be presenting to us one of the many faces of God."</em> p. 145</p>
  
  <p><em>"One cannot behold the birth of light out of darkness without having been first rendered naked."</em> p.131</p>
  
  <p><em>"The light is revealed when one no longer knows who one is—when one is a mystery to oneself."</em> p. 131</p>

  <p><em>Therefore, Cultivate Compassion!</em> Title, chapter 13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Here, in the midst of apocalypse—as we approach the threshold of the new forms/the new creation story—how do we dream, Now, the beginning of the world?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I'm going to answer on two tracks here, one which may seem a bit elliptical. One thing I noticed in apocalyptic dreams of the Compassionate One is that he or she only appears after the apocalypse. It's fascinating! The Compassionate One in apocalyptic dreams is not the one who saves the world. The one who saves the world has a very different character. Before apocalypse, there's a trickster character, who is like an animal that will do anything to survive. One who is trying, in trickster fashion, to sabotage the machinery that would generate apocalypse. So this is one figure in the psyche, the one who will save the world.</p>

<p>The Compassionate One comes after the world has been rendered to ash. I speak of that act of binding together, of storytelling. One woman dreamt of the feet of the wounded children while she led them out of the devastation to a greener world. There's a difference here between the view of before the apocalypse and after the apocalypse. Before and after the apocalypse are two different ways of speaking about where we're at now; two different windows in which to look at the present time. So, we're asked to carry a duplex sensibility, two contradictory images of where we're at now, two contradictory forms of activity.</p>

<p>Again, we have to come to the willingness to let our hearts break. To let the simple shape of the human being emerge: uninflated, tender and with an acceptance of the limitations of being human, with all our flaws. Striving for perfection is...it's simply a distraction. We're not perfectible beings and our beauty is not in our perfectibility. I believe that heartbreak and the willingness to live lives that have a human shape, lives that are responsible is the way we wake up from the dream at the end of the world.</p>

<p>Because the bomb is no longer the primary image, there is an archetypal shift in the apocalyptic psyche. Now we're imaging apocalypse as the unraveling of nature—which of course was happening all along—the bomb was just eclipsing it. Greek myth talks about the Furies, the ones who torment, harass and cause miasma—bad blood or poison blood—to those who violate the Earth, the Mother.</p>

<p>My feeling is that we're moving into a more horizontal mode. We're not looking up to the sky, to the bomb coming down anymore. We are beginning to recognize that our human lives are being shaped by the presence of other beings that are not human. They surround us, they shape us. How do we live in a way that honors that humans exist within a mosaic of communities? It is said that between 30 and 50 million species live on this planet, each of which is a community in and of itself. So, one can enter into that reality—this thin film of life called the biosphere that envelopes this planet and that vibrates as we walk in the midst of it. It has always beckoned to our hearts to listen. Right now, nothing is more crucial than learning the art of listening.</p>

<p><strong>Roberta:</strong> Oh, thank you for sharing your thoughts and your time, Michael.</p>

<h2>The Oceans Above, The Sky Below: A Dream</h2>

<p><em>I have been to a huge party in some kind of military compound, or military headquarters—either Air Force or NASA—and one of the officers wants to show me something. I sensed that this man was not only lonely but also alone, in that he knew something that nobody else knew. Some sort of secret mission. He wanted to show me what it was.</em></p>

<p><em>He takes me into a room that has what looks like an aircraft trainer in it, with seats for a pilot and passenger. He straps me into the passenger seat, makes sure I have a helmet securely strapped on, shows me how to "sight" in something like a rifle sight. (What am I going to be "sighting?") then he gets up into the pilot's seat, presses a button on the stick and we're immediately catapulted into outer space! It happens so fast that it fairly takes my breath away. We hover there for a few minutes, then we're suddenly back in the training room. He mentally tells me to go get something (what?) and come back to do this again. I wander through the halls but don't know which door to go into to get whatever it is I'm supposed to get. Finally, I go into a room full of officers who are just standing around and talking. I ask the one who seems to outrank the others where is this Colonel that I'm supposed to assist. He looks at me with disdain. The others turn around to stare at me as though they thought "Who do you think you are, to be assisting Colonel what's-his-name in such a secret project?" The officer studies me for a minute and then says "Oh, yes, you must be Maria" indicating that he knows this Colonel has need of me. He leads me through the hall toward the training room.</em></p>

<p><em>I say, "Yes, we lifted off a while ago and I must admit I was scared pea-green at first but then I began to enjoy it." He smirks and says: "Yes, I guess there are some people who enjoy doing something different." I wonder what he means by this. Suddenly, before we get to the training room, I see we are in this huge room. It is round, like a transparent bubble. There are windows all around, from floor to domed ceiling and the ceiling is also transparent, like a domed skylight. There is something like a ballet bar against the right side of the wall. Suddenly, the entire bubble-room tilts sharply to the right and everything and everybody starts sliding and falling against the opposite wall. Some of them are yelling, all wondering what in the world is going on.</em></p>

<p><em>The officer who was leading me is the most nonplused by it all. I say to him: "Well, there's something different going on right now and we're all experiencing it." I'm frightened, wondering what it is and what all these people think about it and what's going to happen to Planet Earth. Suddenly, in a flash, I know that the Earth's poles are shifting and what was "up" is now going "down" and vice-versa. It's like the oceans will be above and the sky will be below...a complete REVERSAL of what once was and it would probably mean the extinction of life as we now know it. Not "life" per se but "life as we now know it."</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The River of Light by Lawrence Kushner. Published by Rossel Books, Chappaqua, N.Y., 1981</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Even with its descriptive subtitle, <em>Spirituality, Judaism, and the Evolution of Consciousness</em>, Lawrence Kushner's book THE RIVER OF LIGHT would hardly find its way into the hands of someone looking for the latest good book on dreams. A friend recommended I read it because the first chapter was about dreaming. I found the whole book was. "The dreams we have dreamed are none other than the lives we live," Kushner writes in his simple, profoundly penetrating prose, "We made the dream. We wrote, are writing, and will rewrite again its lines. Shifting its selves and plots and scenery and sequences in accordance with our abilities to endure awareness." </p>

<p>Our ability to endure awareness: that's it! We can only admit so much of reality into our conscious mind then the picture becomes too painfully at odds with the script that society or our parents or we ourselves have devised for us to survive by. That script is called deadness neurosis. It's our survival tactics that get in the way. The secret is that more than survival is possible. We can prevail, we can transform. We can become beings of light. Our dreams don't make sense to us because our lives make no sense. What comes up pure from within is distorted as it nears the surface of our consciousness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Unable to withstand the going up from our depths, enough to remain in its simple form, it cloaked itself in mystery, transformed intolerable desires into dense imagery and words, deleted the 'good parts', substituting them with parts that seemed 'good'. Now all we have left is the piously handed down scroll. filled with square black letters, the spaces between them, and of course, our own fragmented memories of a dream... Once a dream is told, it becomes something else. No sooner has it been recorded or told or even remembered then it ceases to be a dream. Now it is part of waking, it is torn from what shines beneath it and bore it, no longer part of the totality, only a story, perhaps. Waking consciousness closes out more than it lets in." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way waking consciousness has of closing things out is to compartmentalize. We learn new ways of perception from working with dreams but don't apply these to our waking life, which is only a lived dream; or to films and literature, which are merely externalized dreams. Kushner is a rabbi, not a psychotherapist. He obtains his material from the source that is most familiar to him. "Not long ago," he writes, "we dreamt the Bible. From deep within our several and collective unconsciousness, we brought it forth. Twisted, convoluted, and mysterious. But nevertheless true... By reading holy literature as if it were a dream, we gain access to a primary mode of our collective unconsciousness." If the Bible is an ancient product of the dreams we are all still dreaming, though imperfectly aware of, then it follows that the techniques of dreamworkers can properly be applied to it to yield a blueprint of our own psyche and an understanding of the processes by which we undergo transformation and renewal. The Old Testament abounds with short, clipped and seemingly disconnected passages. "There isn't much left to work with " Kushner observes, "like with a dream."</p>

<p>The techniques Kushner employs are not unfamiliar. Yet he seems to draw them from a different, or perhaps earlier, tradition. For instance, here is how he presents what certain dreamworkers would call a "rewrite": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This deliberate leaving of the text of the 'remembered dream', creating a story and returning to the next word, is called, in Hebrew, Midrash. Not the creation of a story from out of thin air, which is called 'fantasy'. Nor the elaboration of one word or event and returning to this same word or event, which is called 'commentary'. But the deliberate filling in of the gap between two words. Not to dissolve their individuality, but to fuse them into the even greater totality from which they have risen and of which they are only a part. This is called <em>Midrash.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kushner's aims, likewise, are as refreshingly stated as they are familiar: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Health (to heal, to make whole) is the result of connecting the discordant and apparently unrelated pieces. And illness is pretending (or believing) that what is broken is really whole... Because we do not perceive our actions as responsible to previous events... our lives seem to be ruled by the caprice of distant, uncaring powers. Our joy is irrelevant. And our grief is unbearable. On the other hand, if we can create a story connecting one 'fragment' of our lives with another and thus join with <em>Midrash</em>-gossamer like webs those separate fragments of our existence, there is now a sentence where before there were only words. Meaning is literally in the connections. And meaninglessness obtains when the events in our lives seem to us unrelated, discordant, and fragmentary... If Scripture is like a dream, the <em>Midrash</em> is like therapy. It is the creative process whereby some of what is concealed is brought to the light of awareness... Unconscious thoughts, repressed and out of sight, exert more force than those that have risen to the surface. It is what we once saw, imagined, planned, and knew as a child but have now forgotten that can free us. Indeed it is from their hiddenness that they derive their immense power. The force of any secret to control human transactions is well known." </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The River of Light</em> abounds with the simplicity and insight that comes from working with dreams. To quote again from the book: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"By the time you're old enough to do what you've been waiting to be old enough to do, it has all changed into a world that you did not make or want... Ultimately, all we seek to learn is what we as children once knew. All genuine learning is this the self's disclosure to itself. How odd and yet how universal the misconception, on the part of all who would learn, that the knowledge they seek is outside them ... Go down through your layers, through your childhood and your dreams... For the layers run back through time but also run all the way down to the source..." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How beautifully Kushner writes and how impossible to sum up his book except in his own words. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The one who pays attention to the dreams, draws on them, and lives them out is blessed, even as the one who dreams is also dreamt. We each take our turn at living out the dream. Like some ageless wave, Scripture flows through us ... The Bible's image for the resolution of all paradox is the coming of the Messiah. The final transformation of consciousness itself ... The coming of the Messiah does not depend upon anything supernatural, but rather upon human growth and self-transformation... The world will only be transformed... when people realize that the Messiah is not someone wholly other than themselves. Knowledge of the self at the deepest level is, simultaneously, knowledge of God." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we work with our dreams or the dreams of others we are not dealing with anything different than the writers of the Old Testament dealt with. It is perhaps a reflection of our diminution of consciousness more than anything else that our own tradition appears as mysterious and impenetrable to us as the dreams we dream. Because of the state of mind we have fallen into these traditions must be worked with just as we work with dreams. "We are not simply custodians of a tradition", Kushner writes, "not just keepers of a museum. Our goal is also to break it open. Set it free." In this task Lawrence Kushner has succeeded remarkably well. <em>The River of Light</em> belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in dreams and in personal transformation.</p>

He feels the loss in the world and the loss of the consciousness he can’t access. He wants to access it. He wonders and I wonder—seeing him there, so isolated, so alone, so fragile—how to make a bridge to it.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we believe that dreams are sent by Spirit to enlighten us, to teach and instruct us in how to live, this dream calls for empathy and deep compassion. </p>

<p>How might we find non-conventional ways to support the President so that he can act in accordance with the soul promises he made and believed in? How might we help protect him from the exigencies, dangers, the insanity of these times, and from the old guard that always surrounds a president? </p>

<p>How might we be alongside him so he can be alongside himself? How can we be alongside him so that he can govern, as I believe he wants to do, with absolute integrity? How can we, together, step out of the pattern of fear, conflict, violence, and on-going judgement that is overwhelming the country, while also finding the viable ways to justice, peace and restoration? </p>

<p>How might we, together, read and live accordingly to the ten questions on the cover of the book? How do we incorporate the possible answers in our daily lives on behalf of the future and all beings? </p>

<p>Here’s another question: What were the ten questions on the cover of the book that, if addressed, offer transformation?</p>

    ns1:description """<p>I am or she is holding the photo and speaking to him, or he is the face in the photo, and I am or she is saying, “No, you will not kill.” He, as a revolutionary, or they, together, they will do what they must, what they have been doing, what has been necessary, but they are here in this country, this Spain of the Imagination and they will leave without killing. Killing will not be the last act. Killing is not sanctioned. I am, or she is, adamant. </p>

<p>But now I am the Mother in a Spain of the Imagination and I am going to the Teacher. I open the door. I tell her that I am here on my knees. I fall to my knees and I am before her. One can only fall to the knees before someone one trusts implicitly. We are women in a Spain of the Imagination. We have dark hair, our faces are strong and clear, we wear black skirts and white blouses. But if we wore only black you would not be surprised. </p>

<p>I tell her that I have come about my daughter. She is sixteen or she is eighteen. She is the Daughter. She will not kill. I will not allow it. It is not to protect the victim; it is to protect my daughter. She is a revolutionary as we all are, as we must be. But, I tell the teacher with whom I am now collaborating, who understands everything, that I will send the daughter away. She will go to another country. I cannot send her to the United States. It is not a country of such women as we are or we have become. It is not a country that forbids killing. </p>

<p>That young man will go to another country too. That young man who is her partner, in the way the man was my partner earlier, when I held the photo or the portrait and knew that he must not and so would not kill. They will not kill. </p>

<p>I speak this to the Teacher. I am or was on my knees and she was seated on a wooden chair by the windows in the classroom that is empty of children. I fall to my knees and then I rise up. It is possible that I am also the teacher. It is possible that there is only one person in this dream and it is myself and I am playing all the roles. No, I am not playing roles. I am everyone in the dream as I must be because it is a dream and that is how the dream teaches us as there are no others in a dream, there is only what we know or what is being told to us by the dream which is the one that, ultimately, knows what needs to be known. </p>

<p>This is the dream. But it is a dream from a world of the imagination that birthed me when I was a young girl or a young woman and when killing (despite Guernica, despite World War II, despite Hiroshima and Nagasaki) was not killing a person but an act that created another world. In such dreams of language, killing was a word not an act. It was a word that led to another world. Killing was a word, an act that had to come to an end in a dream of life, of words come to life like <em>justice</em> or <em>freedom</em>. A dream of a world in which killing was not ever to have to kill a body that could not understand the horror of killing. To kill and not to kill were the same because they created the world we had to create so that the killing would be over.</p>

<p>It was a world I recognized in an imaginary literature of Spain where I have never been. It was a world I was born into through the dreams I do not remember that have rhythms that might be flamenco and which I found again in the rhythms of the poetry and the literature of Latin America. A dream where the light is different than it is here because of the stone houses I have never seen and will never see, and the way the light fell on them in the curved and cobbled streets of the imagination. Dreams of dark forests, where the trees call the black shadows to them and whisper in a Spanish language that lives only in poetry at night. </p>

<p>In these dreams that are not dreams so much as patterns in other worlds, the women knew what they had to know although their mothers wore veils and were silent and sequestered behind walls in cities called the Alameda or Alhambra, the Red. In the languages of these worlds, the men told the stories of what the women were not to know despite the red, despite the red and the black, despite the red roses, the white walls, the casement windows, the barred windows, or the windows without bars that dreamed of light that was brilliant and dark. </p>

<p>The men who wrote the stories did not know what the women knew and were passing on to the daughters, the daughters who come to me now at this time in my life in my dream. The daughters who are straight and tall, who are revolutionaries in black skirts, who have red lips and carry red roses and will not kill. The women who will not kill, so killing is forbidden. That is how strong they are. </p>

<p>The women say, “This is what we taught you then in the dreams that came to you when you were young, the dreams that you have forgotten that came to you in your childhood, the dreams that formed you and surface now at this time in your life when you are asking what is to be done, what is to be done, what is to be done?” </p>

<p>Dreams, like this one, of the photo of the man who, at the end of what he is to do, is not to kill. The photo is not of the man who is to be killed. The photo of the man with the white face or the dark face with a beard is a photo of a man, who ultimately, because he is the revolutionary, the one who brings justice like the sunlight or the rain, will not kill. The woman says so and so it is so. That is what the dream says. And it says that all of this, the story, the strength, the strength not to kill, the strength that ends killing is in language, in the rhythm of the words, and this is what we have forgotten. Earth, rhythm, language, light, they were to have come together in a poetry from which the future might have arisen if we had listened and learned to speak that language, its rhythms and images, to speak it’s absolute poetry. </p>

<p>But then we forgot or yielded to the trance, to the relentless noise from which our cities dull as old metal and gray egg cartons arise in the fluorescent lights of super markets and endless parking lots and deluded malls which have no music to them and so are not the languages that we had been given to heal the world. </p>

<p>And because of this, because it may not be too late, the dream comes, the dream in another language, the dream in which the woman says, adamantly, “The man, my lover, the woman, my daughter, we will not kill. At the end of the dream, at the end of the dreams, we will not kill.”</p>

<p>Whether you are a seasoned dream worker or relatively new to exploring the dreamscape, Jill Mellick has something of value to offer in her book <em>The Art of Dreaming</em>. An intelligent writer who has worked closely with renowned Jungian analyst Marion Woodman, Jill Mellick respects her readers’ intelligence and innate capacity to draw their own conclusions regarding dreams. Rather than presenting trite, narrowing definitions of dream material, Dr. Mellick suggests quick and surprisingly simple ways to delve deeper into dream images and open them to larger meaning, helping ground them in the context of waking life. Using creative tools such as word play, mask making, mapping, clay, drama and dance, <em>The Art of Dreaming</em> is as practical as it is poetic. Mellick shows dreamers how to work in their own way and that dreamwork does not need to be tedious or overly analytical. </p>

<p>Sections include Expressive Dream Work in 5 minutes, Expressive Dream Work in 10-15 minutes, Expressive Dream Work with Nightmares, Expressive Dream Work with Recurring Dreams and Series, as well as The Care and Feeding of Dream Figures and Animals. There is also an extremely helpful set of guidelines for establishing a working dream group as well as a glistening and thoughtful bibliography. For anyone looking to delve more deeply into the mysteries of the unconscious, this book provides inspiring techniques to further tend the images of the soul as they appear in our dreams. ℘</p>

<p>At once tender and powerful, <em>The Dreaming Way</em> chronicles a two-year relationship between artist and dreamer Susan Snow and her therapist Patricia Reis. Dreams and their accompanying artwork are presented together with commentary by each woman, allowing the sometimes gentle and sometimes fierce dreamscape to unfold. As readers, we become co-journeyers in this process, meeting all the places where memory and dreaming intersect. All of the initial awe, power and mystery of the dream are preserved for the reader, and we are allowed to be the proverbial fly on the wall during these amazing sessions. </p>

<p>Following the presentation of the session material, there is commentary on both the artistic, the creative process Susan followed and also a reflection by Reis on the teachings drawn from the dreamwork. A retrospective conversation with Annie G. Rogers follows, further unveiling the magnificence of this empathic, healing collaboration. <em>The Dreaming Way</em> is a testament to the power of a safe therapeutic container and to the possibility of recovery offered to victims of trauma when voice is risked and the thread of creativity and dream is followed within it. Whether you are an artist, dreamer or therapist, you will find something of value in this unique and precious offering.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Dreamways of the Iriquois, Published 2004 by Destiny Books, 288 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Some books I tend to fall right into. The author is immediately credible, my heart is engaged. The message is genuine. In reviewing these books, I almost don’t have to read every word; I just do because I am enriched by the author’s contribution. I savor and value every word. With Moss’ latest contribution to the dream literature, <em>Dreamways of the Iroquois</em>, I wanted to feel that way. I wanted to believe in his work, his writings, his message and his vision and hopes, his true and deep belief in the possibility and potential of dreaming, but his ego kept getting in the way. I kept reading, hoping the information would be new, that depth would creep in, and that the writing would begin to click the way it does in a good book. I continued to hope that the author’s egocentricity would fall away and allow the messages from the dreamtime to speak on their own behalf. Despite his best efforts, Moss failed to accomplish these tasks. I believe that this failure clouded the message of this book. This is quite a sad thing indeed. Who else but Moss would conduct a workshop and use his own dreams to illustrate the technique he is trying to teach?! </p>

<p>Perhaps I am cynical, though. Had I encountered Island Woman or had the amazing visitations and dreams, both sleeping and waking, that Moss did; if those synchronicities had occurred in my life; and if I began dreaming in an ancient language that turned out to be Iroquois, I might feel chosen and special too. I might well have been puffed with self importance. Yet these pathways do exist, and I applaud his efforts and diligence in transmitting this information, these vital dreamways to other worlds and other times, so that they are not irretrievably lost. Whether he chose the Iroquois path, that of the Santeria, or of the Kogi or other indigenous peoples, Moss has traveled and learned a lot. </p>

<p>The book is an odd mixture in four parts. Part one consists of Moss’s personal story of leaving his success-filled life and the spontaneous dreaming that seemed to spring from the land itself. Mythistory comprises part 2, dreamed, not channeled, information from various time travels and shamanic journeys, retelling the creation myth, the stories of Sky Woman, Hiawatha and the battling light and dark Twins. Moss states that he has lived and dreamed these stories, but omits what that means exactly. As with most of this book, we take it on faith, believing in the power and truth of dreams. Part 3 delivers the wisdom of Island Woman in her own voice. She reminds us that we have souls and how desperately important that is in today’s often apathetic world. She tells us that dreams require action and that we can travel forward or back in time in our dreams. We are reminded that we have power animals and of the potential for power to be used in service to either the dark or the light. Part 4 brings the ancient dreamways to our daily lives, Moss’s Shaman at the breakfast table, so to speak. In this section of the book, he outlines what he terms <em>Lightning Dreamwork</em>, a quick and easy way to extract essence from a dream. Soul loss, dreaming for others, dream journals, dream theater, creating dream talismans and dream poetry are all discussed. We are shown ways to bring the images and messages contained in our dreams into full use, as medicine for us individually and as a troubled culture. </p>

<p>If you love dreams and dreaming, if you already or are ready to believe in their power, potential, and possibility to transport you across time and space, to be precognitive, to demonstrate pathways to healing and other worlds; if you have ever wanted to shed the corporate shuffle and live from your heart, and if you can compassionately forgive and read through an author’s egoist inflation, then this book is certainly for you. Moss’s desire to “help rebirth a dreaming culture” is important. His passion for using dreams for healing both personally and collectively is an intent worth holding and nurturing. As global consciousness is brought to higher levels and we choose to listen and learn from our dreams, we must remember that they are a divine language that we share, not only between human beings, but with the animal and natural worlds as well.</p>

  <p><em>"For the Days of the Lord are coming... And it shall come to pass afterward, saith God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. Even on my servants and handmaidens I will pour out, in those days, my Spirit; and they shall prophesy."</em> Words of the Lord himself revealed to the prophet Joël preserved in Joël 2.28-30 in the Old Testament; due to their crucial importance, repeated in the New Testament in Acts 2.16-18.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Part One</h2>

<p>Prophecies of the End of Time, the Apocalypse, abound all over the world. And the clues give evidence that they arise from the DreamTime. Three things have intrigued me all my life: dreaming, myth and the concept of time; they have led me on strange journeys, inward and outward. Recently, I was wandering in Asia and years ago, did a stint with the Peace Corp. in South America. </p>

<p>While in Asia, I spent almost a month practicing Vipassna meditation at a monastery in the north of Thailand. Immediately afterward, I went south to a predominantly Muslim area. Here I read the Koran, with its continual theme of the Resurrection Day, as I listened to the periodic Islamic call to prayer echoing through the salty air. All of this is flavored with the fact that I grew up in an Evangelical Christian household and constantly heard of the Second Coming of Christ and the Apocalypse. </p>

<p>Ever since I was a child, the moment between waking and sleeping, consciousness and subconsciousness, has tantalized me, lured me into wanting to experience more of that timeless state. This exceptional moment is illusive, seemingly ungraspable—sometimes a moment of profound wisdom and tranquility, sometimes a clandestine moment of fear. It is a moment of strange awareness—realization of my own mortality and the world's impermanence. It seems a hazy window into the realm of death and deathlessness beyond... just out of reach. That ‘time’ is our personal prophet peering into the End of Time. </p>

<p>When I was an adolescent, I slept in late one Saturday morning. I had a long and elaborate dream about our German shepherd. At the dream's conclusion, <em>I saw her run into the path of our load truck as it was backing out of the driveway. I heard a sounding thud, then a yelp.</em> I awoke to hear commotion outside my bedroom window. Later that day I asked my dad and brothers if something had happened to our dog that morning. "Yes, she got in the way of the truck as we were backing out and was hit. Fortunately, she wasn't seriously hurt," my dad said. </p>

<p>"Could it be that my entire dream about our German shepherd had occurred within that split second when she was hit by the truck?" I wondered. Other previous dream experiences gave evidence to this theory. This was the beginning of a hypothesis: time is relative to each individual's state of consciousness and this mystery of time can be explored in that moment between sleeping and waking, subconsciousness and consciousness. </p>

<p>Isn't all of Nature subject to endless cycles of lying dormant and awakening? It is at the time of dying that plants go to seed. And the seed's sprouting is the moment of resurrection, of waking. Falling asleep and dying: are they really any different from one another? When we die, so our conception of Time dies with us; and hence, so ends Time itself. This is what Logic and Intuition together lead me to understand. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6msapoc-0.jpg" width=300 height="auto"/></p>

<p>I have since noticed how lucid dreaming occurs when my consciousness straddles the line between waking and sleeping; it seems a consciousness that can simultaneously see into both realms. I always wanted to experiment further into this realm by keeping myself awake for several nights. However, I lacked the stamina.... until I came to the Buddhist monastery. Gautama Buddha discovered, some 500 years before Christ, that the cycles of Time and suffering could be transcended through what he called "the Middle Path" or "the Eightfold Path." Training the mind to follow this path is the point of Vipassna meditation. Buddhists also call it focusing on the Present Moment, not letting the mind stray to either the future or the past. This, I realized, is also the point of the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly in his Sermon on the Mount: Keep your eye "single," focusing on now rather than worrying about yesterday or tomorrow. In the Torah of Jesus' faith, the unspeakable Name of God—discovered by Moses at the burning bush—is a play on the Hebrew word for "to be." It roughly means "the Eternal Present." When I shared this fact with my Vipassna meditation teachers, they were delighted. From then on they often reminded me to keep my focus on the Eternal Present. My teachers gave me day-to-day assignments of walking and sitting meditation. I was clueless as to what they had in mind for me the next day or in the "grand finale" of my meditation practice. I often complained how sleepy I was becoming. Even so, they continued to tell me to reduce the time I slept each night. </p>

<p>Toward the end of my instruction, they told me to go twenty-four hours without sleeping, with a particular walking and sitting meditation assignment. After the twenty-four hours, I thought my ordeal was finished... but they surprised me again, telling me to go another twenty-four hours without sleeping. Following that, I had to go yet another twenty-four hours of sleeplessness, making a total of three days and three nights of without sleep! One of my assignments was to tabulate how many times I nodded off during meditation. This they called "Arising and Ceasing." Eventually it dawned on me that this Arising and Ceasing was that very moment I had wanted to capture! This was that moment between sleeping and waking: the Middle Path, the Eternal Present! </p>

<p>I was so exhausted it was unbearable. I was tempted to lie down and slumber it all away. I finally gave up on the lotus position and crouched on the floor with my head on my knee. That way I could rest a little more and hopefully not fall entirely asleep. I was coming to the point of giving up. "If I sleep, I sleep. If I don't, I don't. I just don't care any more," I finally thought, with my head resting on my knee in resignation. Then, something I'd never experienced before unexpectedly happened. Indescribable peace fell over me. I noticed a fading person with his head on his knee. I honestly didn't know who this person was, whether it was me or the Buddha or someone else. I lost all conception of "I" and "me." Then there was no-body. All senses and all thought ceased. All was blank, empty. The closest description I can share is that all was a pale blue light of emptiness. No pain, no-thing, just utter peace and silence. This experience lasted perhaps 20 minutes—I’m not sure. I felt I could have stayed there forever, but I also felt the urge to come back. When I did, I was completely awake, rejuvenated, refreshed, and blissfully at peace, as if I'd had the best sleep in my life. Then I understood why "Buddha" means "awakened one."</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h2>Part Two</h2>

<p>After leaving the monastery, I remembered that three days and three nights signifies death and resurrection, or transformation in many mythologies of the world. For example, the Sumerian goddess Inanna dies and is hung on a pole in Hell for three days and three nights before she resurrects. Jonah spends three days and three nights in the whale's belly. Jesus says that the Son of Man must spend three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth. The moon is obscured for three days and three nights. </p>

<p>The heart of the earth, the center of the world, the Middle Path: this concept is the factor that links the world's myths and gives us a clue into the End of Time, the Apocalypse. It is the Dream Time. Curiously, in mythologies throughout the world, we find there is a divine incarnation who descends, dies, and resurrects at the Middle of the World, at the Center of the Cross of the junction of the four directions. This Center is the clashing of opposites and the union of compliments into ultimate oneness. This union is often represented by the central axis of the Pyramid, with four corners converging into the fifth, which is the apex. This union is also commonly represented by the Tree of Life, the Axis at the Center of the four realms of the world. The Sumerian incarnation of the goddess Inanna, the Norse Woden, the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, and the North American Corn Maiden, to name a few; each descend, die, and resurrect at the Center of the World, of the Cross. Another variation on this theme is the universal myth of the Great Deluge. In Native American mythologies, the Tree of Life at the Center of the Cross becomes the ladder of Salvation by which people and animals ascend from the flooded underworld to rebirth into a New World. In many cultures, this Tree of Life is hollowed out or constructed into a boat that carries earthly creatures to Salvation. </p>

<p>In the Dhamapada—the sayings of the Buddha—we read that Death overtakes all creatures as a flood overtakes a sleeping village. Buddha's teaching, the Middle Path, is called the Canoe that carries us to Salvation. Similarly, Jesus compares the End of the World, the End of Time, to Noah's flood. Both Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha say the same thing: we must keep vigilant, lest the flood overtake us. The Koran similarly says we must keep vigilant, lest the Apocalypse overtake us unawares. </p>

<p>Our mistake down through the centuries has been to interpret the Apocalypse as a day on the calendar, a point in linear time, rather than the ever-present Center beyond Time and Space. We will all be swallowed into this Center, sooner or later. It is the Eternal Present, the Middle Path between future and past. The ancient prophets, whether they lived 1500, 2000 or 2500 years ago, always said the same thing: the Apocalypse is "at hand," and it will come upon "this generation." This concept has had overly-logical religious scholars confused for millennia! </p>

<p>Notice that in various world mythologies—such as Aztec, Greek, Hindu, Babylonian and Jewish—the prophecies each speak of time divided into four periods, with a fifth period (or end of the fourth) being the time of Apocalypse. Each period is represented by the astrological elements of the four seasons: Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. Each of these cultures also agrees that the fifth (or end of the fourth) is the time of "mixture." In India, Israel, Greece, and Babylon, these ages were represented as Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, and Mixture. In India, Mesoamerica and North America, these ages are represented by the colors or castes of the human race dispersed into the four realms of the earth, with the fifth being the End... when all the colors or castes mix and the boundaries between hierarchies dissolve. This fifth age is one of contradicting chaos or unifying salvation, depending on the perspective.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament book of Daniel, these same mythic motifs are the dreams of the Babylonian emperor Nebuchanezzar. And these are the motifs Jesus refers to in the New Testament. In his first dream, Nebuchanezzar sees these four ages: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, and Mixture. In his second dream, he sees the World Tree, dying and resurrecting. Yes, this is the Dream Time we are peering into. </p>

<p>In the Old Testament book of Ezekiel and the New Testament book of Revelation, these four ages metamorphose into the four Beasts of the Zodiac, representing the four seasons of Time: The Calf (Taurus), the Eagle (Scorpio), the Lion (Leo), and the Man (Aquarius), with the fifth, the mysterious Divine Incarnation, at the Center. In Aztec myth, each of these four ages is represented by a god, a color and an astrological element. The fourth is the mortal Quetzalcoatl, and the fifth is the immortal Quetzalcoatl. This is comparable to the Bible's fourth image: the mortal Aquarius the Man, and the fifth Son of Man in the Center of the four. </p>

<p>Because of our desire to escape the Present Moment, we love to put our hope in Apocalyptic events on the calendar, whether we speak of Christ's coming, the Age of Aquarius or Y2K. But have we forgotten that Capricorn follows Aquarius, starting us over again? Have we forgotten that a galaxy takes millions of years to make one revolution? Have we forgotten that there are four ages within four ages, following for ages <em>ad infinitum</em>? Hinduism calls these ages Yugas and clearly points out their infinite nature. </p>

<p>The fourth age seems like the age of Salvation. Many people perceive the imminent Age of Aquarius as the coming of the time of hope.... and this is why it can be deceptive. Good times are often deceptive, because we cling to them. Hence, in reality, the end of the fourth age—rather than its beginning—truly does become the time of Salvation for many, not because it is a time of prosperity and hope but because it is a time of disillusionment. We finally see that the age of hope comes to an end and we are right back where we started: Disillusioned. </p>

<p>This is when we realize that our only true hope, our only joy, is to accept the Present Moment, to submit to it through good and bad, with all of our being, all of our strength. </p>

<p>Surely good times come, then bad times come. Good karma, bad karma. The four beasts of the Apocalypse, the four ages of the Zodiac, revolve forever and ever and ever in the wheel of Samsara around the Central Fifth, rising and bowing before the Throne, as we read in the book of Revelation. </p>

<p>The Central Fifth is the Eternal Present. It is Mohammed's Day of Resurrection, Krishna's and Buddha's Middle Path, Lao Tsu's Tao, Moses' Day of the Lord, and the Australian Shaman's DreamTime. It is the I AM. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I believe ‘The End of Time’ will merely be the end of our perception of time as we now measure it with clock and calendar. If we can't find our contentment within the Present—through good and bad, at the center of the Cross of contradictions and compliments— then we'll never find contentment and our waiting for Salvation at the End of Time will have been in vain. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Theater director Steven Kent and I had not expected to be working together again on a creative project related to dreams at this time in our lives. In advance of producing <em>Dreams Against the State</em> in 1981, he and I had recreated the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece in 1980 for the first time in 1500 years. I had written the play and Steve was the dramaturge and director. The first production of the play was performed in fifty different venues: private homes, community centers, churches, etc. This deliberate variation on performance space was designed to emphasize the real life danger to dreams and dreaming in our culture and the need for individuals and communities to provide sanctuary for dreams. </p>

<p>Thirty-two years later, in January 2014, we were co-teaching a class on <em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> at La Verne University where Steven is a faculty member of the Theater Arts Department. This project is, perhaps, the closed parenthesis of a creative partnership devoted to theater, ritual, transformation and the inner life. </p>

<p>The creative premise of the class was that the students comprise a theater troupe that visits communities to perform their dreams, and at the same time, are themselves a community whose dreams are explored and reflected upon, theatrically, by the theater troupe. We were imaging being called into a community to enact the dreams in order to help resolve conflicts or disagreements in creative ways.</p>

<p>Because this class, as conceived, is a unique exploration and a first for Steven and myself, we have been surprised and gratified by the unanticipated directions it has taken. During our first meeting, I was startled to realize what fifty years of working with dreams had not revealed before: the essential connection between dream and theater. Dreams come to us as complete theater events, remarkably scripted, directed, enacted and staged. However, in recalling and communicating our dreams, though we may access meaning, we rarely, if ever, transmit the quality and intensity of the dream experience itself. Enter theater. </p>

<p><em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> met four times a week for four hours during the January Interterm at La Verne University, La Verne California. Ancient Greek Aesclepian medicine considered the union of dreaming and theater as essential to the healing process. Steven and I have visited the ruins of the Aesclepian healing sanctuaries in Greece, but the living theater is long gone; and though the transformational aspect of the Mysteries was preserved in our work, we did not recreate our dreams theatrically when relating them to each other every day. So, in this class we found ourselves exploring a new form with remarkably ancient antecedents. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, the limitations of working in a classroom with essentially inexperienced students created the impetus for discovery. We had to begin at the beginning regarding dreams, theater and healing. I had expected to be teaching Theater Department seniors but only some of the students in the class were theater majors; the rest were liberal arts majors fulfilling their humanities requirement. The students ranged from freshman to seniors and came from many different multi-cultural backgrounds. </p>

<p>As Steven Kent does with every class he teaches at the University, we opened each session with a check-in, where we often asked the students to share a dream image. We ended with a check-out that consisted of a question or a statement about dreaming or the content of the class. With this simple device we came to know each other intimately, which is rare in a college classroom. Steven’s theater games further relaxed everyone and released energy and tension, thus reinforcing the possibility of bonding. Dream telling each day involved us deeply in the exploration of our inner lives. </p>

<p>Early on, we made a strategic decision in the interest of efficiency that was critical to the success of the class. We divided the fifteen students into three troupes. Though we heard many of the students’ dreams in the full circle, the troupes worked on their own dreams together when bringing them into form. Because the students now belonged to the dreamers and to the theater troupe, they bonded as a community despite the university setting that generally results in isolation and competitiveness. The students quickly realized they had to be respectful of each other’s inner lives and the necessity of being trustworthy. </p>

<p>Community work happens to be one of Steve’s areas of engagement and expertise, and we were privileged to hear some of his stories about working with gay people in a radical anti-gay state, also with small farmers, with women with AIDs and with other groups in the development of performance pieces. His theater experience with communities, and my experience with individual and community dreaming, together with our life long involvement in the creative process, and more years of teaching between us than either of us wish to tally, were the basis of what we brought to the class. </p>

<p>When considering the actual creation of a performing dream theater group, we both understood that the performance of the dreams would be the ultimate means through which the community could reflect on itself, provide social cohesion and lessen conflict. However, I didn’t realize that the very act of soliciting the dreams in a collective setting would begin the process through which the conflict might resolve. That meant that if the troupe were also willing to present their own dreams in the process of soliciting dreams from the community, the artificial barrier between troupe and community would inevitably dissolve. Finally, enactment could take the community members to yet another level of healing of the original discord. </p>

<p>The most significant understanding came to us when all three troupes independently decided to disregard advice I had given them about enactment. Each troupe met to listen to one another’s dreams and select images/events that reverberated for all of them, which would then be developed theatrically and enacted for the group as a whole. I advised them to avoid “being fair,” rather than including something from everyone’s dreams. I suggested they focus on one or two images/events they found compelling and performable. However, before beginning the work of scripting and developing, each group chose instead to consider each one’s dreams in order to find a common theme. The initial themes were loneliness and separation, explosive emotions, and unacknowledged fear. </p>

<p>At the end of the third week, the three troupes sat in individual story circles, outdoors on the college lawn, imagining darkness and a fire at their center, and spoke of the ways they had experienced these themes in their lives. Though each group exercised confidentiality regarding the details of the stories, when they reported back to the larger group, it was apparent that they had entered the process deeply. They had embraced the experience of loneliness or fear in ‘the other’ as their own, yet recognizing differences as well as commonalities in the origin of such emotions. They had acquired the essential means to understanding and relating back to each other the meaning and implication of their dreams – <strong><em>Empathy</em></strong>.</p>

<p>One student commented that the class had become a group of distinct individuals whom she felt she knew well. Building community had not been one of our stated goals for the class but it became our finest one. </p>

<p>We had found a way, even in a classroom, for the students to experience the exactness and profundity of dream communication. This allowed them to recognize what mattered to them as a community, to refine their intent to communicate this to an audience, to develop language and image to hold their experience, then to embody the experience and finally to perform it for the larger group. The result was that they could bring the dreams back to their original vivid life. Each step in the process eliminated the formal differences between dreamer and actor, between one person and another. Without setting such a heady intention, we were entering into an exquisite balance between our unique experiences, dream language, and the particularity of the dreams themselves, and the trusting and supportive community forming in this setting. </p>

<p>We were working in a multi-cultural setting and outside of conventional psychological dream analysis. The work is predicated on indigenous wisdom dreaming traditions that assume that dreams are a dialogue between the spirit world and the particular tribe, culture or in this case, troupe and university class. This focus allowed for a creative dynamic between particularity and unity and was of great value and solace to the individual class members. No one was left out of the exchange. Everyone was seen as valuable. The class became a sanctuary for the essential beauty and intelligence of each individual within the safety of the circle formed by the participation of each equally. Which is not to say that there were no difficult moments among us. There were. But as far as I know, these issues were acknowledged and resolved. Increasingly, day-by-day, the value of the group, the bond between the students was recognized. </p>

<p>The class process was informed by the presence of Ayelet Berman Cohen, a contemporary dreamer in the old ways. She could not have predicted when she was a prominent photographer in Israel that dreams would become her life. Each night, for twenty years, profound theme-based dreams, as precise and lyrical as any theater or work of literature, have been landing on her, followed by teachings from the ancestors. For many years, she has been dreaming about war, often but not always referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and easily translated into any contemporary struggle between peoples. Many of her war dreams are succeeded by healing dreams, or dreams that are an antidote to war. In one of the sessions, she spoke of how theater allowed the war to be viewed and understood within the very magic of theater itself. The wound and the medicine together in one venue. </p>

<p>She gifted us with a packet of six dreams that gave the students original dream images to work with. Independently, the troupes each chose one or two of the same images to dramatize and explore, so we understood that the conflict between victim and victimizer spoke deeply to them. This initial work with her dreams, which were so fully formed and precise in their theatrical intelligence, prepared the students to look at their own dreams and excerpt the wisdom from them. </p>

<p>Three student dreams at the threshold of the project set the tone for the work to come. One student told a recurring dream that began when she and her family were immigrating to the United States, having already fled civil violence in their native country. In the dream that first came when she was a child, she observed the on-going tension between freedom and imprisonment. The dream had revealed, even to the young child, the fundamental torment that her family and culture were experiencing. </p>

<p>In relating a dream to his father, another student discovered that the family had psychic gifts that had not been spoken about but were passed on through the patriarchal line. </p>

<p>Aware of a repeating image in her recent dreams, a young woman decided to call her indigenous grandmother, only to discover that the dreams were warnings that her proposed generous action would violate her people’s tradition and she would have to wait for the right ritual moment to perform it. </p>

<hr/> 

<p>The final days of <em>How to Start a Dream Theater</em> were spent developing the theatrical presentations. Within a remarkably short time, each troupe went from acting out various dream episodes to identifying the common emotional elements, finding dream sequences to hold them, and then discarding these images and events for more vital and appropriate images that communicated the fullness of the conditions and emotions to the observers. Informed by Liz Lerman’s <em>Critical Response Process</em>, the students were then able to revise their pieces once again, bringing each to a new level of reflection and communication, perhaps even more powerful than might arise in a class on improvisation because the images developed from the deep personal dream life of each student. </p>

<p>The students had not known that dreaming had already and would continue to affect and influence their lives. Repeatedly in the check-ins or check-outs, the students expressed their surprise and gratitude for these ways of knowing that they had previously thought entirely unimportant. </p>

<p>Elenna Rubin Goodman, a community builder, had come to the class from Oakland California. The class served her deep desire “ to bring together community, sacred space and the ritual embodiment of dreams/dream theater.” And we were grateful that we could serve both the students and others seeking new ways of serving community that include validating inner life experience. </p>

<p>Three texts informed the class: <em>Black Elk Speaks</em>, by John Neihardt, <em>Healing Dreams: Exploring the Dreams That Can Transform Your Life</em> by Marc Ian Barasch, and <em>The Practice of Dream Healing: Bringing Ancient Greek Mysteries into Modern Medicine</em> by Edward Tick and Stephen Larsen. Each text speaks to the ways dream inform and heal culture as well as bringing wisdom and insight to individuals for their lives. So many of the dreams that the students brought into our circle were unexpectedly revealed to be vehicles for connection, community and cultural restoration. Entering and living within a dreaming culture is an essential antidote to totalitarian and fundamentalist thought. This is iterated by Paco Mitchell in the Winter Solstice 2013 issue of Dream Network Journal, an essay that we shared in class: “…dreams are such bastions of freedom.” </p>

<p>The class was not <em>about</em> creating a dream theater; rather, our intention was to facsimilate the experience of dream theater troupes and dreaming communities. We had started out suggesting that the students imagine that they were a dream troupe or a dreaming community; within days the imagined manifested. We learned swiftly that understanding self through exploring and performing dreams is also a means to establishing communal identity while emphasizing the wild freedom and uniqueness at the core of the creative process. Some of the students may go on to use dreams in their creative work. All of them, I am certain—whether as physicians or private eyes, (two examples of the students’ present vocational goals)—will use dreams as part of their future work in the world. </p>

<p>Considering in retrospect my unheeded advice to the dream troupes and their intelligent insistence on following their own wisdom, I am grateful to have been reminded of the sensitivity necessary in approaching another community — in this case, the community of students. We must always fully respect the other culture and what the community itself knows. Fortunately, I didn’t insist, didn’t impose my own understanding. Fortunately, they chose to discern and honor common themes and experience, and to create communities of respect and relationship among themselves. Fortunately, we all honored the dream.</p>

<p>Each student presented a seven-minute excerpt from the journal they kept for the duration of the class that included dreams, the new understanding of their power and importance, reflections on the class process, and selected passages from the assigned texts. Most spoke their deepest truths to each other, though we had been strangers to each other only a month before. Everyone now understood that he or she has an inner life and all were excited about tending it for the rest of their lives. No one doubted the value, meaning, experience and beauty of dreaming. The possibility of an on-going dream group was gratefully received. </p>

<p>When we were leaving the LaVerne Theater Department, we stopped to converse with the Chairman, David Flaten. Musing together on the original goals of a dream theater to help resolve community conflicts, he paused to wonder, “Should we start a Dream Theater?” Ayelet responded, “Now I am dreaming the end of war.” ∞ </p>

<p><strong>THE FINAL GIFT</strong> of our collective Dream Theatre experience comes from Ayelet Berman Cohen, a dream entitled “Restoration” and which summarizes her dream spirits’ understanding of the process that was destined to engage us all. </p>

<p>(Published with Ayelet’s permission.) </p>

<p>January 23, 2014 </p>

<h3>“Restoration”</h3>

<pre>

A group of students

meet on behalf of their inner lives.

They speak to each other,

and to their astonishment,

discover that the night before,

they all have had the exact same dream.

In their dream

a python lives underneath their house.

There is a group of people shackled to a tree.

And there is another side to the tree.

A woman who lost her mother is there.

And a shark who looks deeply into the eyes of a boy.

There is fear, laughter, movement and confusion,

each image and emotion

matches perfectly in all of their dreams.



The student body has had one common dream.

In their dream they see

a woman carrying a suitcase.

She says it is filled with dreams.

She tells them how the Spirits come to her every night

and dictate to her a dream.

The woman says she has been touched.

When the students wake up

they know that their inner lives

are no longer the same.

Did the Spirits come to them too?

How do the Spirits move?

Who are the Spirits?

Have they been touched?

They wondered.

The silence had been broken.

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6rcodpc-0.jpg" alt="Cloud alarm clock" width="300" height="auto"/></p>

<p>Is a new social awareness about dreams emerging? Not just a few individuals here and there arriving at new heights of dream accomplishment: rather, a growing importance for groups of people who know what it means to safely share their dreams and help one another learn from them. And beyond a few groups, what would it look like for dreams to get real appreciation and respect from the entire society? Can you see it? No? Not even in small ways? </p>

<p>Were this to happen, I think an amazing power would be unleashed that far surpasses what any individual dreamer can generate on their own. For our society, this would be a huge change from where we have been with dreams for some time. And yet I want to hold out that bold vision, as distant as it may seem at present. I want to encourage everyone to spend some time periodically fantasizing about what a difference society's appreciation might make. </p>

<p>One source of inspiration for that vision is looking at other cultures for whom dreams have been in that special spotlight. One can see how many Native American tribes, Australian Aborigines and other indigenous peoples held the dreams in a central place in their collective lives. Some of the strongest inspiration in this vein can be found in fiction, such as the inspiring <em>Kin of Ata</em>, by Dorothy Bryant or Kilton Stewart's writing on the Senoi (<em>The Mystique of Dreams</em> considers this writing to be false as anthropology, yet I continue to find it inspiring and useful as fiction). </p>

<p>These cultures, of course, are very different than our own. All of them lived much closer to nature. Most of them would be called primitive by our culture, usually with a derogatory tone. Yet perhaps we have been too quick to judge. I would at least suggest that we consider what we may have lost along the way, both in the ability to hold the dream in a central place of ho nor and in the ability to live in harmony with nature. Is this really the necessary cost of the civilization that we have developed? What kinds of changes would be needed to regain these abilities? </p>

<p>Perhaps we can look at this particular vision in more depth in future columns, but I would also like to hear about the kind of vision that inspires and moves you. As dreamers, many of you understand the power of a strong vision and the importance of developing depth and clarity. I want to encourage you to be as bold as you can with your dream possibilities visions. In fact, be outrageous! After all, do the dreams themselves hold back? </p>

<p>I realize that many readers may consider this suggestion to be merely an idle exercise in fantasy, or else a certain recipe for frustration. However, I think there are ways to ground our boldest visions in reality and avoid either danger.</p>

<p>My first formula is simple (although it may seem difficult at first): High ideals, low expectations. In other words, develop really outrageous visions of what you would like, but do not expect them to develop soon, easily or maybe not at all. It is a paradox. but if you can hold that direction it can take you a long way. </p>

<p>Here is another formula: Take one of those high ideals and ground it in a simple first step that might move you In that direction. Try it out and see what happens. Another way to think of it is to envision the big picture, the long journey, then break it down into smaller sized pieces. What is the first step on the journey that you might take? If that is still too big, what would a smaller step be? If it comes easily, what would be more of a challenge next? As things move along, does your original vision change? </p>

<p>Final formula: Look at what is already happening that might be moving things in the direction of your vision and work with that. Ride on that energy, as well as encouraging it along. Use your intuition about what might be about to happen and go with the current when it is headed In your direction. Of course you may want to challenge and confront other events that run against the grain of your vision as well. </p>

<p>What does all this mean in concrete specifics? I see a culture that is both hungry for what dreams can offer and at the same time very cut off from them. Where individuals break through the anti-dream biases of our culture to not only connect with their own dreams, but to take leadership in helping others to do so, this is inspiring! My bold vision of a dream-positive culture Is served by those people sharing information and support, and finding ways to encourage new leadership to emerge. </p>

<p>I feel the networking happening in several ways. One is through publications such as this one, other journals and the many books that have come out on dreams. Secondly, I see it at international dream conferences which are now occurring on an annual basis. Both of these are big accomplishments. </p>

<p>Third, there is networking that takes place on a local and regional level. This is most obvious in a few areas where formal networks have developed, such as the Metro DC Dream Community, The San Francisco Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers Support Group and the Montreal Centre for the Study of Dreams. I suspect many other areas have less formal networks going. </p>

<p>These local networking efforts can serve a variety of functions. Simply sharing information and support is perhaps the most common. They can also be a way to reach out to new people and keep dreams in the public eye more effectively. They provide the nucleus for dream related conferences, festivals and other projects. </p>

<p>While it may be very valuable to network with those whose involvement with dreams is similar to yours, there can also be huge benefits in connecting with those who work in very different ways. For instance, a person who gives workshops on the grassroots community level may develop a contact with a teacher in a local college who uses dreams. Or a therapist may find a scientist In the area. While there are big differences here, these people may have a lot to offer one another as allies. And by identifying common interests and ways they can help one another out, as well as appreciating differences, all can benefit. </p>

<p>Local networking should be of particular interest to those who may not always be able to travel to larger international conferences. Further, over time these local/regional networks might be established in many areas, so as one traveled or moved about, they could simply plug in to the local network for sharing and support. While some networks will logically focus on one town, others will do better to start out with a regional focus, perhaps breaking down into smaller areas as they grow. At present my primary interest is to network within the New England region at large. Networks have functioned in New York City and Boston. Can these be revived? </p>

<p>What is the most likely local/regional network in your area, what is already going on. and what is the best next step? I'd love to hear about both successes and failed attempts. as we can learn from both. </p>

<p>Two more quick questions: Has anyone tried using movies and films about dreams to reach out and educate people? If you have, how did it work? If you were to try this, what would you recommend? I would like to pull together a filmography, including instructional films about dreams and dreamwork as well as popular films that have something to offer. In the latter category I think of "The Last Wave," ''The Lathe of Heaven," "Brazil," and even "Nightmare on Elm Street." What comes to your mind? </p>

<p>If you have any dream films to suggest, send me the title, director/author, very brief review and where it can be obtained/cost if that is important. Review copies on VHS are welcome and will be given strong review consideration. If you need your copy back , write with details before sending. </p>

<p>Finally, who can suggest a good source of pens with a light in them? Something that would work well for writing dreams down, perhaps low cost, good quality, that could be made available for dream workshop participants. Getting dreams recorded does not take much, but this can be a good tool and I'd love to know a good source. </p>

<p>Do keep those cards and letters coming. A few have already rolled in and you will start seeing the results in my next column. Let's all join in to make this a real participatory space!</p>

<p></a></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee_of_Sleep">The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use Dreams for Creative Problem Solving &amp; How You Can Too</a> by Deirdre Barrett, 2001, Crown Publishers, 211 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>In this excellent book, Deirdre Barrett details the most important dream-inspired discoveries and creative works of art, music, film, science and medicine that are known. She looks back over the historical record, as well as offering many first-hand interviews with dozens of contemporary people. While simply recounting and verifying these stories alone would make for a great book, the author goes beyond that to discuss many other fascinating topics along the way. </p>

<p>She starts out with the uses of dreams in painting, sculpture, filmmaking, theater and literature. The uses of dreams in these disciplines reproduce dreams most closely, since their mediums are a natural fit with the imagery and story lines in dreams. Many artists have proclaimed dreams as their source of inspiration. For painting, she examines the dream experiences of William Blake and Salvador Dali, including a detailed description of Dali’s “slumber with a key” technique for catching artistic inspiration from hypnagogic dream imagery. She also discusses the process of a dream being turned into art, including dreams that at first simply seem to be nightmarish or problematic, and are only turned into artistic inspiration with time and work. </p>

<p>When examining film, she looks at the work of Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Robert Altman and John Sayles. Along the way, we see how some filmmakers and painters use lucid dreaming to seek out artistic inspiration, and ponder how the proliferation of movies may be altering the nature of dreaming. </p>

<p>In examining dream inspiration in literature, the book looks at Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly, Robert Louis Stevenson, Stephen King and many others. She quotes extensively from Naomi Epel’s excellent book, Writers Dreaming. She also gets her book title from the John Steinbeck quote, “It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.” Using the metaphor of the committee of sleep for dreams is powerful, but I suspect some will find it overdone and at times annoying. </p>

<p>In the chapter on dream inspiration in music, we learn how the tune for Paul McCartney’s song Yesterday arrived in a dream. At first Paul thought he must have heard it from someone else, and since it arrived in a dream, it took some time to claim it as his own. And originally, it had no words, so he played with it under the name of “Scrambled Eggs.” The final version became the inspiration for the string sound of the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album, and has been played six million times on American radio, more than any other song. </p>

<p>Billy Joel states that “all the music I have composed has come from a dream” and Joseph Shabalala, founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo reports that he has dreamed music every single night of his life, always sung by a choir of children. This sparks discussion about the wide range of musicians who have gotten inspiration from dreams, some frequently, others as rare occurrences, some from hearing the music and others who were inspired by a visual dream. </p>

<p>In her sections of scientific discoveries and inventions, we look at the famous discovery of the molecular structure of Benzene, and the invention of the sewing machine, along with many others. Along the way, the author examines some “urban legends” of discoveries made in dreams which further investigation reveals were not actually dream inspired. These include the discovery of the structure of DNA or the structure of the Atom. Clearly, these faulty stories give ammunition to those who dismiss altogether the idea of dream creativity. But as she shows in this book, most of the classic stories do check out. </p>

<p>These chapters also include a good guide to ways that people can incubate a dream, focusing on a particular problem or issue one would like their dreams to address. She examines a wide range of ways that dreams have inspired discoveries and breakthroughs, even in a scientific culture where dream inspiration is not always highly thought of. </p>

<p>In her chapter on dreams &amp; the body, she shows how dreams can offer medical diagnosis and treatment that was not consciously known, often in a symbolic form. Although not much research has been done in this area, she reports on what has been done. Further, she shows how many athletes have been able to practice and enhance their performance in dreams. A final chapter on Dreams in nonwestern cultures examines how an entire written alphabet was inspired by a dream and adopted in the African country of Liberia, when they had only used an oral tradition prior to that time. She also shows the part that Gandhi’s dreams of resistance played in the transformation of India into an independent state. Examples such as these and many others lead to discussion of cultures who honor dreams and listen to them more closely than our own. What might our culture learn from them? </p>

<p>In our culture, dreams are seen as mostly personal and psychological, best viewed in therapy, as mediated by a professional therapist, if they are given any attention at all. As the author points out, many other books deal with the psychological aspects of dreams. This book will go a long way in giving dreams respectability outside of that narrow box. The discussion of how these dreams have been translated into creative expressions and Nobel-prize winning discoveries can be inspiring. The discussion of how to listen to dreams, how to increase lucid dreaming or incubate a dream, may encourage many readers to adopt these practices. </p>

<p>In the end, the author concludes that dreams are neither consistently wise or consistently useless, but that dreaming is a different mode of thought, and its true power may lie in how dream inspiration can compliment waking thought. Further, she points out that we live in a dream-neglecting culture and may have much to learn by listening to those from dream-honoring cultures. This is an important book which I hope will be read by many.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Henry Reed</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> How did you become interested in dreams? </p>

<p><strong><a href="../@henryreed">Henry</a>:</strong> There were two things. One, as a psychology graduate student at UCLA in the '60s I was interested in multiple personalities, amnesia and fugue states. I was interested in how we knew who we are. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What's a "fugue state?" </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> It's like a multiple personality, but one shot at a time. A person becomes amnesiac of who they are, becomes someone else. Then one day they wake up and wonder what they've been doing. You might say it's like prolonged sleepwalking, except it could go on for months or years. My advisor told me I wasn't going to run across too many multiple personalities, I wasn't going to run into amnesia very often and fugue states were rare; how was I going to make a living in this publish-or-perish world? I should find something that happened more often. Then I realized we were amnesiac for our dreams. We'd have these experiences while we slept and in the morning we were none the wiser. The human potential movement was starting about then so it was easy to say, "Learn to remember your dreams, learn how to tap into potential." I started with how to remember dreams. Then it dawned on me that I didn't remember mine.</p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Oh, so you really thought there was a correlation between being a researcher and being a dreamer? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> Well, there was for me. Before I started any experiments I started to record my dreams. I worked on that for more than six months. Based on what I'd learned, I taught a course in dreams. We kept records of recall and tried experiments in recall. That was my first project. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> You said there were two factors that got you interested in dreams. </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> I had a friend who kept telling me about these incredible dreams he was having. They were often psychic. I never saw any reference in psychology to dreams except in terms of interpretation or analysis. My friend was inspiring me to look beyond them. While he was looking for a studio, he dreamt of one. Then he drove around town to try and find the studio. He found it. That incident struck a chord, as if dreams were somehow an internal gyroscope, an internal advisor. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> I know you have a close relationship with A.R.E. (the Edgar Cayce organization). Was that always your metaphysical focus? <strong>Henry:</strong> At one time my friend had an interest in Cayce. It seemed to me that Cayce went into a fugue state in which he was wise; then he'd wake and be an ordinary guy. I took more of an interest in his process than his philosophy. </p>

<p>For my dissertation my advisor thought it would be good if I ran an experiment myself. The female research assistant who had been running them said something like, "I don't know why you men do these kinds of experiments. You already know what you want, what you're trying to get, so we're just going through the rote." I sat there through the experiment and kind of felt the same way. </p>

<p>I had received a lot of flack at the university about my ideas of full disclosure to the subjects about the hypotheses, that there should be dialogue between everybody, a cooperative venture. This was the ideal of humanistic research espoused by Sydney Gerard who wrote <em>The Transparent Self</em>. </p>

<p>I got pulled into the A.R.E. primarily because they were trying to figure out a way to do research that was similar to the way I had been thinking: to invite the subjects in as co-learners with the experimenter. That model didn't exist anywhere else. </p>

<p>Cayce had said that the ideals and purposes of the researcher had a lot more to do with what would be discovered than the nature of the experiment. When he'd get approached to do telepathy tests, he'd respond that you wouldn't learn much about telepathy if you focused on telepathy per se, because it tended to create a certain kind of self-consciousness in the person: am I being telepathic or am I not? He said that it would be better to create situations in which people could be helpful to one another and have no other way of doing it than through telepathy; to focus on the nature of the help that would be received or given. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> Is your work inspired by Native American tradition or Shamanism? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> I never used the word "Shamanism." Because of the impact dreams were having on me, I followed a Shamanic pattern unknowingly. I was always interested in what today we would call "channeling:" bringing something from one realm into another, creating a complete cycle. I was really interested in some other dimension of life and dreams were the doorway. </p>

<p>My first recorded dream addressed the fact that I was alcoholic. It was explained to me that I was acting out my own healing by doing dream incubation work. </p>

<p>I felt dreams were part of a complete feedback loop, receiving inspiration from whatever source, enacting the inspiration and giving it back to the source, so that more would come. Dreams are a source and have to be fed, with some activity or by honoring them. I even did a study whereby if a person did something on the basis of a dream, they were more likely to have a dream, and have a dream that was understandable. It's like two in a conversation: if you're talking to somebody and they're deadpan, you lose interest. But if they're animated, they talk back, get excited. </p>

<p>I started drawing my dreams. Dream shields came out of a dream related to the Dream Helper Ceremony. For Dream Shields you take symbols from many dreams and put them together to represent the whole of you. It was as if each dream were a snapshot in a family photo album. You could look at each picture and ask, "Who is this person?" The composite would represent what you considered to be your path, your style or your identity. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What kind of dreamwork do you do? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> When I work with people in counseling, dreams are never a priority for me, it's always the person. Most of the dreamwork that I have done has been in workshop settings, educational settings. Usually there's some challenge that I'm responding to. </p>

<p>One of the challenges was to find the dreamwork equivalent of "you only own what you can give away". I'd have people tune in on a positive quality or dream image that seemed to represent that quality and have them work until they made sounds, improvised singing, movement and dance. They'd perform the "song and dance" of their dream symbol as a give-away, like they were emitting energy. Then I'd have people become qualities that were weak, hurting, in some kind of need. We did a lot of plays and ceremonies of blessing one another. People would enact their positive symbols with the idea that they would bring them more to life. Looking back now, this was another way I was trying to channel energy into everyday life. </p>

<p>When I was first involved in writing, another challenge was, could I teach a person how to interpret their dreams though the printed word, where I wasn't going to be there physically? I used journal writing as a method. </p>

<p>Most of my work has been dream informed: on the basis of a dream I'd get the idea to do this experiment or that experiment. So while I was working on developing a journal, I said to the A.R.E. people, you may have a dream about this experiment we're doing, and if you do, send it in. A lot of them did and a couple of them dreamt of a journal. They also showed a lot of excitement about dreamwork they could do at home and they wanted to know about other people's experiences. So the beginnings of <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> was feeding them back a report. </p>

<p>The work with shoe dreams is based on what I learned when I was publishing Sundance: You can get a lot of people involved helping with a project if you only keep feeding them back what they send you. Usually the communication's just one way, but if you feed it back, you incorporate their dreams; they feel a part of it and it grows. We couldn't live in a dream community, but through the vehicle of a journal we could have a community where we could learn about how to work with dreams, the implications.</p>

<p>I used the idea with subscriptions. I had people put their subscription form under their pillows. It seemed like a dumb idea. It shouldn't even be possible because we dream about things we care about. It takes a lot of effort to direct your dreams, and this was towards an abstraction. Yet people dreamt about the journal and got real excited about it. </p>

<p><strong>Linda:</strong> What are your goals now? </p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> The major goal I've always had is for people to realize how creative and full of spirit they are, if they would just flow.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104132.Dreaming_While_Awake">Dreaming While Awake: Techniques For 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming</a> by Arnold Mindell, 2000, Hampton Roads Publishing Company, 288 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dreaming is the mystical source of reality. This book is devoted to perceiving, living and orienting you to the power of Dreaming. My goal is not to notice the Dreaming only occasionally, but to develop a constant awareness of Dreaming with the new method I call 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have long known that Arnold Mindell has some unique and very important insights into dreams, having noticed his books on the Dreambody approach, synthesizing dreams with bodywork. As a graduate of MIT and the Jung Institute in Switzerland, Mindell founded a new school of therapy called Process Oriented Psychology. But this book is a true groundbreaker, a shamanic surprise, surpassing all expectations. </p>

<p>This book is inspired by the concept of the Dreaming, as it is understood by Australian Aborigines. Mindell begins by examining Aboriginal Dreaming and its connections with quantum physics, psychology, and Buddhism. For the Aboriginal elders, the Dreaming is the basis of all life, and is clearly larger than what we think is going on in rapid eye movement sleep. Mindell does a great job of explaining this view to western readers, using the metaphor of the light and dark sides of the moon. While most of us go through life focused only on the bright side of the moon, we need to have an understanding of the dark side, the Dreaming reality, in order to have a wholistic grasp of deeper reality. Further, Mindell states, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"...it seems to me that ignoring the Dreaming is an undiagnosed global epidemic. People everywhere suffer from a chronic form of mild depression because they are taught to focus on everyday reality and forget about the Dreaming background."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the Aboriginal peoples have long noted this tendency we have to "ignore the Dreaming" in statements such as "White man got no Dreaming, him go 'nother way. White man, him go different." Mindell, on the other hand, shows in this book that we each can develop an awareness of the Dreaming. In fact, for many he would maintain it is essential for a full and complete life. "Without Dreaming, you are living only half your life and seeing only half the world." Much of this book discusses what is would mean to develop that awareness, with many specific exercises to enable the reader develop that ability. </p>

<p>In the effort to expand our awareness of the Dreaming, Mindell also expands the meaning of "lucid dreaming." This expanded definition has many implications for anyone exploring dreams. He states, "Because you are Dreaming all day long, I wish to expand the idea of lucid dreaming to mean being awake during Dreaming not only at night but also during the day." He traces the history of the western concept of lucid dreaming through Rudolf Steiner, Alan Worsley, Stephen La Berge and Jane Gackenback, and shows how that understanding is too limited and fragmented for his purposes. He then shows how his work, along with insights from Australian Aborigines and Eastern perspectives, such as that of the Dalai Lama, point of a larger, deeper wholistic definition of lucid dreaming. Thus he urges the reader to develop an awareness he calls 24-hour Lucid Dreaming.</p>

<p>Mindell draws in a neat little diagram where The Dreaming is the basis of life, the root of it all. Arising from that level, we come to Dreamland, the place where dreams occur. And then, arising from that, we come to consensus reality, the place where you and I live our everyday lives. He points out that most of the study of dreamwork focuses on the relation between what goes on in Dreamland and daily consensus reality. In this book, we focus our attention on lucidly noticing experiences occurring between Dreamtime and Dreamland. This is subtle work, often examining vague feelings and intuitions that can barely be verbalized. Mindell does a good job of not only verbalizing some of these usually vague and invisible parts of reality, but also showing how such work can have profound ramifications in our daily lives.</p>

<p>The bulk of this book goes into specifics about how one might develop such a deeper awareness of the Dreaming in various areas of our lives. Mindell examines addictions &amp; relationships, time travel, lucid healing &amp; preventive medicine, and Dreaming as world work. Each of these discussions include innovative exercises, instructive stories and diagrams and ideas for further exploration. If there is a downside to this book, it may be that the reader is introduced to so many possibilities that one becomes disillusioned or frustrated. There is no way that any author can cover each area approached here comprehensively. </p>

<p>I recommend this book very highly for the inspiring perspective and wealth of insights, as well as specific exercises geared to developing a deeper awareness of the Dreaming. I suspect that readers will be able to take the ideas in this book in many different directions. As Mindell states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"My goal is to make the Dreaming roots of reality so accessible, so visceral, that your conscious mind will give you back your right to dream."</em></p>

    ns1:description """<p>Traditionally, technology is not linked to the world of visualization, regenerative processes or dreams. Technology is thought to be too narrow to contain or support that delicate, yet ever-so-strong inner world. It would seem that the binary, on-off logic would render dreams lifeless and bruised. Yet the computer provides qualities that surprisingly lend themselves to dream work. Two of these qualities are storage and retrieval of the dream report, and text editing.</p>

<p>In the development of a dream translation program for the Apple Computer, these two qualities have been incorporated. The software is designed to translate the dream report into a format that substitutes meaning for symbology. This is accomplished through the creation of an expanded, second dream report using the individual's personal symbology.</p>

<p>This one-to-one correspondence between symbol and meaning is only one technique and is not intended to fully contain the total meaning of the dream report. What it does provide is an alternative view that opens up other possibilities for self-exploration.</p>

<p>In the past these rigid formulas (symbol = meaning) were used for gleaning understanding from the dream. To dream of teeth falling out meant that you were pregnant. Period. No ifs, ands, or buts. The individual's dream reality was narrowed and constricted to fit a pre-fabricated system that had the effect of decreasing the understanding of the dream rather than enhancing it.</p>

<p>With the advent of 20th century technology, the individual is now able to create and store his or her own data bank of dream symbols, and access them within a matter of seconds. These are then used in a substitution process to generate a second expanded dream report. The second dream report is a natural outgrowth of the individual's own understanding of his or her own dreams. As the personal data bank of dream symbols is constantly updated, the second dream report reflects the person's current life changes.</p>

<h2>Example: Original Report</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am in an old-fashioned puritan village. All the colors are softened like an old film. Everywhere people are dressed up in puritan costumes and are enacting small scenes from the Bible. They perform them naturally as part of their lives. I, too, am dressed like a puritan. We are going to a production. Loretta is driving a V.W. We go around a country lane that has hedges sticking out which we can not see around, so we have ta go very slowly. We arrive at the school. We are sitting in the back row. Some guys are sitting next to me and I ask them to move over so I can save a place for Robert. Outside I see the characters in the play.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Second Dream Report: Created by using the individual's personal symbology data bank</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A part of myself is in an old-fashioned controller community. All the moods are softened like an old sequence. Everywhere people are dressed up in controller disguise and are enacting small scripts from the life. They perform them naturally as part of their lives. A part of myself, too, is dressed like a controller. We are going to a revelation. Saboteur is driving cheap transportation. We go around primitive route that has obstacles sticking out which we can not see around, so we have ta go very slowly. We arrive at the place of growth. We are sitting in the back perspective. Some guys are sitting next to me and a part of myself asks them to move over so a part of myself can save a place for light. Outside a part of myself sees the roles in the belief examples.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The computer generated report ensures an abstracted perspective built upon the individual's personal view of the dream symbols. Therein lies the major effort on the part of the individual of creating a personal dream symbology which becomes the link between the dream and the computer. </p>

<p>Imagine telling your dream to your friendly personal computer. Upon hearing your dream, your computer interviews you about your feelings in the dream, your associations to the various symbols and your memories for recent events. The computer then reminds you of similar symbols and themes from previous dreams and what was going on in your life at that time. The computer then helps you to create an animated cartoon of your dream while it analyses the movements in your cartoon in terms of your typical animation style and feeds you back insights on the feelings expressed in the animation sequence. If you wanted to dialogue with the images in the dream, the computer would analyze thematic sequences to your dialogues, explain how you were feeling in past times during the expression of similar themes and suggest areas to explore. </p>

<p>Upon request, your computer displays text and pictures concerning universal aspects of particular symbols in your dream, selected on the basis of your personal associative context. To help you distinguish between aspects of your dream symbols that are personal and those aspects at are more universal, the computer displays dreams from a large dream bank containing the same symbols appearing in your dream, and helps you discover your dream's relationship to these more typical patterns. If your dream contained some important references to apparently external events, the computer would provide you with a survey of dream themes and symbols collected over the past 24 hours from around the world, and by providing you with visual statistics, help you determine if your dream was unusual and idiosyncratic, or if a significant number of other people were currently having dreams with similar themes or symbols. You could determine if your "earthquake" dream this morning, for example, was conveying a personal upset in terms of a personal metaphor or in terms of an objective event that was being used as a symbol around the world. If the nature of the dream was such that you wanted to contact others who were having similar dreams, the computer would promptly inform you of how to contact those individuals. </p>

<p>This bit of science fiction fantasy may or may not seem appealing. Dreams are intimate and from the "right brain", while computers are definitely extensions of the "left brain" world. Dreams and computers have in common, however, the ability to process enormous amounts of information in order to create their respective products. When trying to interpret our dreams, our limited conscious knowledge is often meager compared to the amount of information condensed in a dream. What would happen if the computer's information processing ability were put into the service of helping us understand the information the dream has processed?</p>

<p>Everything described in the above imaginary scenario is possible, either now or with computer systems of the not-so-distant future. Working toward this future, I have been administering a far-reaching program called the "Dream Net Project". Like the initiation of the space program, it is ambitious, requiring the coordination of many different component projects under development by many different people and should lead to many interesting beneficial spinoffs in the process. It certainly has some profound implications for networking among our community of dreamers. Even if the "Dream Net" project can not, for some years to come, yield the type of incredible results depicted in the above imaginary scenario, there are many useful things that today's personal computer can do to relieve some of the drudgery of dream collecting and analysis, both for a dreamer's personal use and for research purposes. For example, a dream journal word-processing and filing system would make it easier to write down dreams (it is easier on a word processor), to modify and manipulate the dream text in the process of written interpretive work, and to store, sort, and retrieve past dreams that may be relevant to the dreamwork at hand. That much is quite possible today. </p>

<p>In fact, rudimentary versions of such a computer-aided "dream interpretation journal" have been constructed. These are rather simple tools that store your dreams by title and compile your "dream symbol dictionary" from information you provide. The interpretation routine is based on a simple "symbol definition substitution" method, prompting you to define your symbols, then substituting your definitions for the symbols in your dream, giving you a very rough "interpreted" dream text. If you have a "communications device" (a modem), instruct your computer to call 1-303-722-6210 and you can play with this symbol substitution "dream interpreter" routine. When you call in, select the "Dream Net" menu. Here you will find, besides the dream "interpreter", many other items of interest to dreamers. It contains my initial attempts to introduce the dream community to on-line computer networking. This service is part of a larger computer network system called "Parapsychological Information Network" (for more information about P.I.N. and its newsletter, write to William Tedder, P.I.N. Systems Operator, P.O. Box 10456, Denver, CO 80210).</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6rsgdnp-1.jpg" alt="Sweet Dreams" /> </p>

<p>At this particular point in time, I am working to develop a more useful filing and retrieval system for personal dream collections. Currently, the only commercially available "data-base" program that seems suitable is the rather expensive program called "Sci-Mate Personal Text File Manager." Its "bit-mapped" memory system allows you to retrieve all stored dreams that contain the word, or words, you specify. As I make contact with more dreamers who are computer specialists, I hope to be able to develop a less expensive dream filing system that incorporates this amazing feature. </p>

<p>Being able to work with large files of dreams becomes especially important when dreamers wish to learn from one another, as in group projects or in research. In the Sundance Journals I began a rather tedious project called "The Book of Dreams". Its goal is to gather collections of dreams and organize them around particular symbols. You will be able to look up "snake" in the "Book" and read many different dreams involving snakes and get some idea about how snakes behave in dreams. This information could help you determine the meaning of your snake's appearance in your dream. The experts on symbology whom we respect—such as Carl Jung or Joseph Campbell—are essentially historians of mankind's symbolic output. One way these experts answer a question such as, "what is the meaning of 'snake' in a dream?" is to present many different dreams, stories, and legends in which a snake appears. I have boxes of dream collections sent to me by people responding to the original announcement concerning "The Book of Dreams". With access to computers, it is now a reasonable task to begin entering and compiling these dreams. I am now interested in locating other persons who are interested in contributing dreams to this collection, or in other ways helping to work on the project. As the "Book of Dreams" develops, printed versions will be made available, although the ultimate use of the collection will be to store over a million dreams on a computer for instant access by the dreamer.</p>

<p>The original "Sundance Experiment" concerned the emerging apocalyptic imagery in dreams, and attempted to integrate these dream themes in search of an emerging "New Age" mythology. Today there have been several attempts to stimulate a group to dream about a particular topic. It is difficult to process the information in these dreams, to determine what themes the group dreams have in common, to what extent such themes might be expected by chance, and to pinpoint group dream themes that are suggestive of a transpersonal or psychic connection. It was this particular problem that stimulated me to begin the "Dream Net Project". </p>

<p>The method of "content analysis", developed by Calvin Hall and <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Robert Van de Castle</a>, is a useful tool for analyzing dream series or large groups of dreams for certain themes. It has facilitated dream research in many ways, and it has the unique advantage of being "theory free". George Baylor, at the University of Montreal, has created a computer-aided content analysis program on a large, main-frame computer. His work may be helpful in developing a personal computer version that would prompt the individual dreamer in content analyzing a series of dreams. It would also facilitate the content analysis of the results of a group dream experiment, such as the "Dream Helper Ceremony" devised by Bob Van de Castle and myself (see Omni Magazine, December, 1983).</p>

<p>This particular group dream experiment involves a group of dreamers who attempt to have telepathic dreams of healing and guidance for a target person whose problems are unknown to the dreamers. A computer-aided content analysis program, coupled with a large collection of dreams, would be able to show what themes are emerging in the dream helpers' dreams and whether or not such a focus of dream themes would be expected in a random sample of dreams. This system could also be used to compare the group's dream themes with other group's dream themes to show that this particular group of dream helpers are focusing on a narrow target topic. This particular application of computer-assisted dream interpretation is the one that I am most interested in at this particular point in time as I believe that it will help to focus more attention upon the "paradigm-smashing" potential of group dreaming. </p>

<p>One of the spinoffs of working on such a project is that creating a computerized dream interpretation program requires you to examine your assumptions about how dreams are to be interpreted. To clarify my own thinking about the processes involved in interpreting a dream, I developed a "programmed workbook" for dream interpretation. Entitled Dream Realizations, it leads the user through a 28-day period of dream recording and dream interpretation through journal writing, and daily application to problem solving. It is an attempt to lay out a "program" (although no computer is involved) of creative problem-solving using dream interpretation as the major source of inspiration. In testing this workbook with hundreds of others, I have found that the majority of users report favorable and exciting results that fit their own needs. Such results show that a "programmatic" approach to dreamwork doesn't necessarily have the pitfalls you might imagine. It does seem possible to develop instructional material for dreamwork that is capable of being adapted to the computer. </p>

<p>If you find yourself interested in any of the topics mentioned in this article, if you want to keep posted on developments and to learn how you might participate in this project, send me your name and address. This next June (20-23) at the 2nd Annual Conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams, which will be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, I will be organizing a "Special Interest Group on Dreams and Computers". I hope to meet you there where we can all exchange notes on this topic. </p>

<p>Many theorists regard dreams as either compensatory or adaptive in nature. Jean Piaget viewed dreams as being a hybrid, incorporating both of these functions. His concept of dream functioning straddles Adlerian, Freudian and Jungian theories. Piaget believed that dreams were multi-purposeful. He designated six categories to describe their relationship to waking reality (Piaget, 1962). His six categories were also applicable in the realms of unconscious symbolism and symbolic play.</p>

<p>On the one end of the Piagetian scale, dreams have the capacity to fulfil wishes. This concept is very similar to the Freudian concept of dream functioning. The wish fulfilment occurs, according to Piaget, without secondary symbolism, which indicates that wish fulfilment occurs through unconscious assimilation. Assimilation is that process in which external reality is incorporated into psychological or biological structures by modification of external elements. The unconscious, assimilative functioning of the dream is manifested in the symbolic representation of daily experience.</p>

<p>Secondly; dreams are seen by Piaget as capable of fulfilling wishes through a process of conscious assimilation as opposed to unconscious assimilation. in this classification scheme, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between dream object and waking object. The dream symbol is the same object that is being dealt with during waking reality.</p>

<p>In the third category, Piaget viewed dreams as having compensatory capabilities similar to Jung's perception of dream functioning. For example, events that are unpleasant to the individual during waking reality are represented and expressed in dreams as pleasurable experiences.</p>

<p>Nightmares occupy the fourth category. They are considered the counterparts of waking play in which fearful events are deliberately created by the individual. The function of the nightmare is to simulate, manipulate and experience situations and events that would otherwise have irreversIble consequences if created during waking reality.</p>

<p>The fifth category is comprised of dreams that function as punishment for actions contrary to the individual's accepted perception of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Lastly, dreams function as direct translations of organic stimulus from waking reality. One of Piaget's examples is the child's dream of watering a garden which would correspond to a child wetting the bed in reality.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It has been said that music makes the invisible visible and brings together the physical and the spiritual, giving voice to images and a felt-sense of the nature of inner reality. Experience shows that this is what takes place while we dream. Whether awake or asleep, a spirit-realm of the imagination opens up to us during night-world and day-world visions.</p>

<p>One of the obstacles we moderns face is our predisposition to literalize our understanding of events. As Storyteller and Mythologist Michael Meade reminds us, “Modernity’s obsession with progress and blind rush to create a future based in technology seems to require a thorough departure from the past. The past, especially the ancient imagination that caused humans to stand and walk with heads in the heavens and feet on the goat’s earth, holds keys that can unlock the literalism of the present and open the future to greater meaning”.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Applying this stance to the disciplines of dream-work, shamanism and sound healing, it is possible to <em>see beyond the literalizations by which we create isolated entities</em>, thus distorting our view of the world. Something symbolic, and real in its own fashion, comes into play during the practice of these disciplines, helping to weave back together the isolated elements, until we can perceive reality as an integrated “fabric” of great beauty and value.</p>

<p>Tom Cowan, contemporary explorer and writer, has defined shamanistic practice as follows: “The core elements… found in most cultures with a solid shamanic tradition are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shamans can voluntarily enter a unique visionary state of consciousness during which </p></li>
<li><p>they experience a journey into non-ordinary realms of existence where </p></li>
<li><p>they acquire knowledge and power for their own use or for others in their communities”.<sup>2</sup> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Compare these characteristics with <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor’s</a> description of <em>imaginal engagement</em>: “In Gestalt work with dreams, the dreamer re-enters the dream, re-imagines and re-experiences the dream from the subjective viewpoints of other characters or figures in the dream… even the stones and the trees, conscious and self-aware, will speak with the ‘shamanic’ explorer, offering startling insights, re-framed interpretations of the dream, and deeper understanding of the waking life dramas that the dream reflects and shapes”.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>In working with dreams, we are entering multi-layered realms, which correspond to traditional descriptions of shamanic journeys. This increased awareness of circumstances in the dream-quest, when correlated to the dayworld, benefits the dreamer and the environment in which she or he exists, just as entering non-ordinary states of shamanic travel can enable one to bring back a boon to the collective.</p>

<p>For example, in a recent dream-exploration at a weekend workshop I hosted, we worked with a dream that, according to the dreamer, foretold an unexpected professional transition. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The dreamer is writing computer code in the dream for an actual technology client of his. As he drives away from the dream-jobsite, his car breaks down. He realizes that he needs to back up the computer code he had written so far, aware as well that the “breakdown” of the car could potentially cost him his job with the client. At the end of the dream he feels concerned about finding ways to “continue the project”.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not long after the dream, the dreamer did, in waking reality, lose his job, yet he was prepared for the loss, due to his having worked on the dream. As a group, we re-imagined this dream, which allowed us to consider the benefits of the messages it contained. We <em>resonated</em> with the dream’s ability to communicate about the future, a lesson in the value of being open to messages from the dream world. Inherent in the central notion of shamanism is the perception that “everything is alive”. The Aboriginal people of Australia, the Ngarinyin, Worora and Wunumbal have a phrase for this, “Yorro Yorro”, which means, “everything standing up alive, brand new”.<sup>4</sup> The purpose of reflecting on ideas from various cultures and the living experiences of our dreams is to rediscover a helpful perspective that supports an interrelation among ourselves and the environs in which we live. Similarly, the essence of shamanism, recently resurgent in places like Mongolia<sup>5</sup>, is the recognition that we are part of an enormous web of life that includes the archetypal-spiritual realm. As the Celts have said, we not only need the help and wisdom of the Otherworld (their name for “non-ordinary reality”), the Otherworld needs us to help tend that realm by making visits to its territories and engaging with its denizens and landscapes.</p>

<p>By taking dreaming one step further, making waking journeys with the support of drumming, music and sound, we’re able to creatively relate with living energies—in the subtle realms of imaginal space, in waking and dreaming worlds—for the benefit of the earth. In this way we support our own deep nature and our connection with the vital living matrix of all life. By seeking to search beyond the limited egocentric orientation of the modern mind-set, amidst the overly wasteful and disconnected culture of the day, we may find previously undreamt of solutions to the brewing eco-psychological dilemmas of our planet. When we experience the reality that “everything is alive”, we can interact with the entities and creations of all the worlds in a responsible, relational fashion. As Taylor puts it, “Too much of the contemporary shamanic revival involves embracing the theatrical trappings of traditional shamanic praxis without grasping the fundamental pragmatic point: <em>everything is alive</em>, and the more I know about and commune with that life, the greater the range of creative possibility I will be able to imagine and manifest. This is as true in dealing with the subtle symbolic energies of computers and automobiles as it is in dealing with animals and ‘illness spirits’”<sup>6</sup> —i.e., the shamanic idea that certain “entities”, subtle-energy beings or forces, can cause sickness”.</p>

<p>We’ve helped to shape the waking world we live in; if we can perceive that it’s alive, we may feel and act upon the inherent impulse to care, not just for ourselves, but also for all of life as we can perceive and relate to it. One consequence of such a realization is the challenge to learn how to re-invigorate an approach to living more sustainably and artfully with the technologies we have invented. The effects of sound and music have been studied comprehensively. It has been shown that instruments like the Aboriginal <em>didjeridu</em>, Tibetan <em>singing bowls</em>, Shamanic <em>trance percussion</em>, as well as singing and chanting, support vibrations in the body that are comparable to brainwave patterns found in deep, healing states of consciousness. The sounds projected by these tools have similarly been shown to create levels of harmonious resonance in the minds and bodies of individuals listening to them.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Following such inspiration, I collaborated with Ben Leinbach in creating a music album entitled “Yoro Yoro”. Some of my own dreams influenced this recording. This musical journey is our effort to evoke the felt sense that there is an ongoing, creative, living energy inside of and surrounding us. In the dream circles I lead, we all chant and I also play flutes, didjeridu, drums and bowls in order to open us to the energies and frequencies of shamanic, dreaming realms. In this work, we re-enter dreams to re-experience and interact creatively with events in the dream, seeking further understanding and wisdom. This practice has been called Conscious or Active Dreaming, and it bears a distinct relation to shamanic journeying. I also lead dream incubation ceremonies where dreamers are invited to seek healing wisdom while recalling or “growing” dreams for themselves and also for the community.</p>

<p>In one such instance, during an on-going group meeting, a participant shared her dream of a <em>Noah’s Ark school bus filled with wild animals and creatures, traveling across the ocean surf near the shore</em>. Together, the entire group re-imagined the dream. Individuals found personal layers of meaning in this “incubatory re-entry practice”. We also found there was a common layer of symbolic engagement in the dream. In our waking experience of this narrative, several of us felt a strong sense that it invited us to bring the energies of our archetypal instincts into closer connection with the solid ground of our embodied earthly existence. Others felt that the dream was connecting us to actual living beings from the Otherworld that wanted us to learn from and relate to them. They wanted us to value their promptings about living a life of wholeness, allowing them to express their natures in our lives, as an antidote to our all-too-human, lop-sided consciousness.</p>

<p>By seeking to reinvent and honor the sacred traditions of shamanism, musical ceremony and dreaming, we may creatively encounter the obstacles we face as humans and co-creators living on the planet at this time. Opening ourselves to the reality of our Dreams, the Otherworld or the Collective Unconscious, we can engage with a much broader range of wise and innovative possibilities, taking into account the entirely real and felt experience that “everything <em>is</em> alive”, which is a natural outgrowth of connecting with these vital and rewarding disciplines.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Vanishing Delusions by <a href="../@ornabenshoshan">Orna Ben-Shoshan</a></i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>In the summer of 2007, just a few weeks before I began to write my own book, I read an article by <a href="../@paullevy">Paul Levy</a> in the Dream Network Journal that introduced his book titled <em>The Madness of George W. Bush</em>. I was impressed with the beginning of Paul’s article, which held a profoundly significant truth that few seem to fully understand. He stated, “We live in a world where the deeper, underlying mythic patterns that have endlessly reiterated themselves throughout human history are incarnating and revealing themselves through world events for all who have eyes to see.” This is a truth reflected in his book that remains a valuable contribution, despite the fact that Bush is no longer in power. If we are not thoughtful, the mythic patterns Levy addresses will find their way back into our collective experience. I have come to understand that not only do these mythic patterns reveal themselves in world events, as Levy pointed out, but they are continuously revealing themselves in our personal lives, as well.</p>

<p>For those of us who have been schooled in Shakespeare or in Jungian, humanistic, transactional, or transpersonal psychology, or even Freudian analysis, it is clear that much of who we think we are, in fact, is comprised of roles we play in a world that is but a stage. Each of us has our own unique dramas and traumas that weave in and out of the not so unique parts we play. We put on the costumes and don the masks that fit the part we play and we live from the roles instead of from our true selves. In As You Like It, Shakespeare described the 7 stages of a man’s life from infant to old man, during which there were expected actions played out. Jung saw us acting out of personality types and subtypes, in the stages of our lives, all with recognizable actions and reactions to the world around us, with the ultimate objective of becoming individuated beings embracing our whole Self.</p>

<p>We can see our roles played out in relationships in terms of the Karpman Triangle, where we take on the part of rescuer, victim, or persecutor and each position holds a set of behaviors that attempt to control the other as a way of creating whatever feels missing in life. Sometimes, we play from one position and, later, switch to another when our primary role doesn’t seem to be working. Or, we can look at the American Psychological Associations, DSM IVR and see the behaviors that are characteristic of dysfunctional roles people play, with predictable dialogue, scripts, and outcomes. And, if we are willing to be completely honest, most of us can find ourselves in at least some of the categories of pathology on any given day.</p>

<p>From this perspective of lives made of roles and scripts acted out on the stages of our lives, it is easy to see how many of us experience waking dreams or nightmares that keep coming back to us again and again, that contain seemingly a never-ending replay of suffering, emptiness, and disconnection. Some of us find a way to escape the nightmares of waking life with diligence, and focus on goals of great accomplishment, but even in success, find emptiness or meaninglessness in the end. What we try to escape in our waking lives can disturb us in our dreams, making sleep something we avoid or cannot find, and we fill our waking lives with distractions to avoid looking at what is not working, even if the distraction is to only look at what is working. Far too many of us feel as if the light has gone out of our eyes so very early in our lives and few seem to make it to the golden years, with that beautiful light still emanating from deep within. Many quake with unexpressed anger throughout their lives, only to have that anger reflected in body dysfunction in the late years or they quietly slip away trying desperately to not remember the failure of the roles they played in life.</p>

<p>All of this—the mythic patterns played out on the global level, the scripted patterns played out in our individual lives, the relationships we enter with such hope that lead to disappointment, the unsuccessful attempts at finding freedom from the unpleasant patterns, and the dreams and nightmares we have while we sleep, that reflect what we won’t let ourselves see in waking life—are the experiences our true self draws to us to help our disconnected self wake from our personal and collective mythic sleep.</p>

<p>Each of us—with all the truths and lies, the light and darkness, the consciousness and unconsciousness, and the unfathomable capacity for both good and evil—contains a unique spark of the God, a truth that most of us have long ago disowned, forgotten in some distant past incarnation, and we shutter to consider the possibility of this as the truth. Despite our experience of separation and the roles we play to distract ourselves from the pain of this experience, we may well be evolving toward a shift in our understanding of ourselves that will allow us to awaken and remember who we truly are, to release the individual and collective stage, the scripts, and the roles we have been playing and the masks we have worn our whole life, if not for lifetimes, and live from our authentic and unique God and Goddess selves.</p>

<p>This idea of waking from the dream is not new, and certainly, the ideas I have expressed have been written before I penned these words on virtual paper. But, you might ask, what do these ideas mean in your everyday lived life?</p>

<p>From the perspective expressed herein, everything in your life, whether waking or dreaming (and some would say there is no difference between our waking and dreaming selves), creates reflections to help you see what you believe, to help you recognize that you are the creator of your life experiences that, too often, repeat themselves over and over again in different forms until we recognize that we have created them and have a choice to continue or to stop these creations.</p>

<p>A painful event in your childhood might have caused you to believe in loss and your entire life has been peppered with struggles related to loss as a theme: loss of love, loss of connection, loss of financial security, loss of respect, and on and on. Or, you might live a life attempting to hold on to everything, while underneath, what fuels the holding on is that belief in loss. You might believe in sacrifice, which is reflected back to us in multigenerational sacrifice, whether as war hero, as martyr, as defender of the weak or downtrodden. You sacrifice yourself and experience the sacrifice of others. You might believe in powerlessness and spend your whole life suffering at the hands of others, or find yourself fighting for power, a fight that you never quite win. But if you do win it, you are never safe in the winning, because of the fear that whatever you might be able to grasp will be snatched away from you if you are not hyper vigilant. Deep within there is still a belief in powerlessness.</p>

<p>You might believe in power and find that you possess it, but some early event caused you to believe you cannot possess love. As powerful as you become, you are unable to maintain love in your life. Or, you might believe in love, but not that you can have both love and power, so your life is surrounded by those you love in a disempowered state, never realizing that you created what you believed.</p>

<p>This idea that we create our own lives and experiences is not easy to embrace. It can feel like an unjust judgment, especially when circumstances that impact us seem to be completely of someone else’s making. But once understood, the awareness we gain can provide the doorway to the life we came to live. When we learn to embrace our responsibility without attaching blame, guilt, shame, or punishment, we can discover the myths we have held, the beliefs to which we have attached that draw to us those conditions upon which we build—or tear down—our lives.</p>

<p>The Western world holds such a limited understanding of who we are. Its commitment to individualism negates the reality that much of who we experience ourselves as being, is a collection of individual and cultural mythic patterns and roles created generations ago, and, perhaps, lifetimes ago. While we are living our beliefs as individuals with the masks that we wear for the roles we play, we are, also, living the beliefs of our parents and grandparents, and the collective beliefs of our cultures and our species. But, even this more expanded view of ourselves as the current embodiment of a collective past, is not who we truly are. This identity, this image we hold that we call us, is simply a reflection of the beliefs or what Levy referred to as the mythic patterns that cover the unique being that we are, a being that most of us have never known exists.</p>

<p>We are living in a time when we have the opportunity to become conscious of our beliefs by being willing to examine the dreams and the life experiences we draw to us, whether the dream comes to us in our sleep or in our daily life. When we look at what we are individually and collectively creating, we can recognize the masks that we wear and discover who we truly are under the mask. And as the amazing sparks of God that we are, finally, we can be free to choose the lives we want to create.</p>

<p>From the fall of 2007 to the winter of 2008, I wrote a book about my own journey to examine what I created in my life to discover what beliefs prevented me from knowing who I truly am. As this work was coming to a close, I became aware that what I had written was not just for my own journey, but also, was written to offer a perspective that might assist others in discovering who they truly are. This book, <em>The Meaning of Three: The Mask</em>, reveals so many of the mythic patterns played out in one individual life and explores ways of becoming free of those patterns. Once we remove the mask to discover and embrace who we truly are, the patterns and roles melt away, and what remains is the essence of who we are, who we have always been, finally uncovered and free to live as the unique being that we are, eternally in union with the Great Mystery…the Creator of all that is… including us. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It is commonplace today to hear it said that we can solicit guidance from our dreams - that we can pose questions or problems to our dreams and receive answers or solutions. No doubt many subscribers to DNB have had experiences that lend support to this notion. On the other hand, scientific research on dreams has hardly demonstrated that dreams have any meaning worth interpreting, much less that they may be solicited as oracles. What a gap in world views! </p>

<p>It could be useful to bring scientific inquiry as a tool to help would-be dream solicitors evaluate and perfect their guidance systems. For example, Carl Jung, who paid tribute to the tremendous wisdom expressed in dreams, nevertheless, cautioned that apparent examples of controlling dream content were too often self-deceptive perceptions of the dream's truly autonomous intent. An attitude of scientific research may help us avoid self-deception, but that research approach must be compatible with our objectives, less it become irrelevant. </p>

<p>Research related to obtaining guidance from dreams has generally taken one of two forms. The first involves attempting to control dream content, where a person is given some specific theme to try to dream about ("You will dream about trees!"). The second involves attempting to solve puzzles in dreams ("Complete this series: OTTFFS!"). The simplifications these types of experiments introduce may well eliminate the ingredients necessary to effectively persuade the intentions of the dreams. Themes that are easy to define and identify are necessary in experiments, yet it it probably much more difficult to dream about what you are instructed to than to dream about what you really care to. Having a known answer to check against the dream's answer makes experimental evaluation easier, but what is the point of spending precious dream time on puzzles? </p>

<p>Several years ago, the A.R.E. commissioned me to create an experimental situation to investigate Edgar Cayce's claim that it is possible to solicit guidance from dreams. For this project, I deviated from the usual types of experiments in that I asked the dreamers to define for themselves the problem theme to dream about, problems for which no known answers already existed. This project was carried out through the mail, and required that I develop in writing a detailed outline of the step-by-step procedures the dreamers were to follow at home in seeking guidance from their dreams. The result was a workbook that emphasized journal writing as the main medium of focussing the person's efforts and of working with dream interpretation. The workbook specified a period of 28 days of working on the problem at hand, going through weekly cycles of problem definition, writing petitions for dream guidance, dream interpretation, and formulating trial solutions for testing and evaluation. The workbook thus required a level of commitment on the dreamer's part to solving the chosen problem that Cayce had said would be necessary to obtain valid guidance from dreams. </p>

<p>The results of this project, conducted with over 500 people, were very encouraging. Dream recall, rather than the quality of the "solutions" obtained, was what was measured numerically, so there was no "hard data" to evaluate the dream guidance. Yet the self-reports prepared by the participants contained many convincing stories of problem resolution. Over the years since, in fact, I received so many requests for additional copies of that workbook that I finally revised the workbook, now titled, DREAM REALIZATIONS, for sale to the general public as a creative problem-solving tool. </p>

<p>The A.R.E. then asked me to design another research project, this time concerning the evaluation of psychic readings. The format was to follow a suggestion made by Cayce, that if you were going to consult a psychic concerning a troubling question, then you should consult at least two, and that you should also meditate, consult your dreams and alternative sources of guidance, and then correlate the results. There were 124 participants in the project. Each one submitted four personal questions that they wanted answered. Their questions were then given to a group of psychics selected by the A.R.E. on the basis of their reputation and on the results of a sample test reading. Each participant's set of questions was answered by two psychics identified only by number. Their questions were also addressed through other sources of guidance: an astrology reading was provided, a numerology reading, a counseling session, and several hours of group discussion~ personality inventories were administered at the beginning of the session and results explained and discussed with the participants. In addition, each participant was given an opportunity to solicit dream guidance for one of their questions, using a condensed, ''one-night stand" version of my revised DREAM REALIZATIONS workbook. The participant's job was ·to then complete a workbook requiring a structured and concrete evaluation of the information provided by the two psychics and to compare their answers with the information obtained from the other sources. They also had to perform a series of numerical ratings concerning these comparisons. </p>

<p>The amount of information generated for statistical analysis was substantial, and will take another year to evaluate. However, one little piece of that data speaks to our question about soliciting guidance from dreams. In one of the rating tasks, participants were asked to make a judgment concerning the relative help they had received from the various sources of guidance. They were to distribute 100 "tokens" to these various sources of guidance according to how much help on their questions they felt that source had provided. We were expecting that, overall, the psychics would receive most of the "credit," and generally speaking, that is what happened. The only other source of guidance that received nearly as high a rating was the dream guidance. Of the 124 participants, only 60 of them remembered their dreams, and of these, 50 felt they were able to compare their dream information with their psychic readings. Of these 50 persons, 30 felt that the psychic readings were superior to their dream guidance. However, the other 20 participants felt that their own dream guidance was as good or better than either one or both of their psychic readings. That is, for every three people who felt that their psychic readings were the most helpful, there were two people who felt that their experience with "Dream Realization" was the most helpful in answering their question. We didn't expect dreams to "win", but we were surprised that they scored so well against the psychic readings. Remember, this finding is a preliminary result. As we analyze the data in more detail, we will be able to learn, for example, whether the relative effectiveness of dream guidance compared to psychic guidance varies as a function of the type of question being asked. </p>

<p>This project has indirectly suggested an intriguing, new way to research the question of whether dreams can be solicited for guidance. Suppose you have a question or problem you can't resolve - where are you going to get the best information: from your dreams? from a book? from a counselor? from a psychic? If dreams prove to be a good source <em>relatively</em> speaking, then even if it is still difficult to prove the dream's <em>absolute</em> value, we'll know nevertheless that we're onto something. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I open my closet and a torrent of shoes pour out upon the floor."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream initiated a research project on the meaning of shoes in dreams. When I placed a call for dreams of shoes in <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, 172 dreams were submitted. What type of footprints do shoes leave in dreams?</p>

<p>The most frequent pattern was a dreamer noting shoes having special features. Dreamers found shoes made of volcanic ash, for example, or shoes made from living, walking turtles, shoes with wings, and high-heeled tennis shoes. </p>

<p>The second most frequent pattern was the theme of being concerned about the appropriateness of the shoes being worn. One dreamer tried to walk through snow in high heels. Ronald Reagan sold another dreamer a pair of shoes the dreamer wasn't sure she really wanted. One dreamer complained that the shoes didn't fit appropriately, they were too tight. Another dreamer wore tennis shoes to a fancy ball. </p>

<p>The third most frequent theme was that of losing one's shoes. One dreamer left a party and later discovered that she had left her shoes behind. Someone took another dreamer's shoes. One dreamer was standing in line at a complaint department to describe shoes that had been lost. Another dreamer was riding on a horse when his shoes fell off. </p>

<p>There were many other frequent patterns. Many dreams expressed the theme of an abundance of shoes, such as the dream that. initiated this project. The theme of polishing or repairing shoes was also common. Many dreams involved shopping for shoes. Discovering old shoes was another favorite. </p>

<p>Shoe stories in dreams seem to mirror the shoe situations encountered in life. Shoes with special features seem to be a notable exception. </p>

<p>What do shoes mean to the dreamer? Respondents offered such explanations as understanding, role, adaptation and persona. More generally, we might suggest that shoes represent cognitive schemes, or mental abstractions, used as structures to contain and give shape to experience. They are used as an adaptive tool to help navigate through life situations. Carl Jung once remarked, "The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits in all cases." </p>

<p>Many shoe dreams reflected a concern for individuality as well as appropriateness. In one dream, for example, the dreamer lamented that all the shoes in the store seemed mass produced and none fit her unique orientation. One dreamer offered this observation, which can be taken both literally and metaphorically: "It's hard to find a good looking pair of shoes that fit comfortably." </p>

<p>Given this concern for functional and appropriate shoes that match the dreamer's individuality, it is surprising that in none of the dreams was there ever mention of making one's own shoes or having custom made shoes . Here is an aspect of shoes from real life that is missing in dreams. What can explain this discrepancy? Perhaps it is because the types of understanding symbolized by shoes aren't the sort we consciously create, but come from the subconscious mind. For example, in fairy tales, it is often the brownies that make shoes for a person while that person sleeps. </p>

<p>One final note: Three dreamers noted that their shoe dreams came at a time of transition. Perhaps when we need to pay attention to our style of adaptation, we think of our shoes.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Just as Sir Thomas More struggled against the demands of King Henry VIII, as depicted in the film, <em>A Man for all Seasons</em> (Bolt, 1960), many humans are trapped by the unbending structures built around the ordered and predictable seasons of their lives. The worlds, within which many of us live—especially in the Western tradition—are filled with what we accept as unalterable rules and most of us not only live by those rules, but die by them as well. <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a> (2002) points out that, “our culture consistently erects boundaries, constructs borders, and divides the world into neat (and sometimes overly meticulous) categories that allow us to go about our business in a more or less orderly way” (p. 34). And rarely in the tight constructions of those bounded worlds do we find people who understand that there is something very real, perhaps even more real, that exists beyond the rigid constructs of what we mistakenly identify as the real world.</p>

<p>The accepted world filled with verifiable and testable structures—the empirical world that is seen, touched, heard, tasted, and smelled—moves, we assume, in predictable patterns that build the ordered seasons of our lives, until some unusual experience challenges the structures. And, perhaps, for the first time in our lives, we have an opportunity to decide what world we are willing to embrace. We can embrace the unusual experience and allow for the possibility of a much broader, more limitless world or reject the experience and continue to live…and die…within our comforting, yet often uncomfortable limitations.</p>

<p>Stanley Krippner is one of those rare persons who—from a very early age—knew that there were worlds beyond this one and has spent his life studying and teaching about these worlds so that others could learn to glimpse into the more limitless realities that he first observed when he was so very young. In an email correspondence, Stanley explained to me about his early interest in these other worlds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“As a child I spent a great deal of time reading. I lived on a farm in Wisconsin. There were very few people my age in the neighborhood, and my sister was much younger than I was. Once my parents taught me how to read (before attending school), I devoured anything and everything around the house. Of special interest was a set of books my grandparents had owned. They were kept in the attic. They contained mythological tales from all over the world, and this stimulated my interest in mythology. Many of these myths, legends, and folk tales involved dreams. So I began to start my own dream diary. I continued this on and off through junior high school, senior high school, and college. Once I began graduate school, I kept writing down my dreams continuously and now have a collection of several thousand…. My grandparents' set of books contained many examples of extraordinary dreams — those about the future, about past lives, about visitations by angels or spirits, etc. So my interest in PSI and in dreams goes back to those old books. What would I have done without them? But PSI and dreams later became a part of my personal experience, and so there was never a “disconnect” between what I read and what I experienced.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Stanley was about eight years old, he dreamed one of those pivotal and life-altering dreams that opened the door to what was to become his life’s path, as well as his gift to the world. He shared with me that dream.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I dreamed that I was outside our farm, looking up at the sky. Suddenly the sky opened up and I could see an entire cosmos beyond what was ordinarily visible. The second world was made up of pastel colors, complex casual-like forms, intricate, but harmonious. The message to me was that there was more to life and the universe than is available to our ordinary ways of perceiving reality. In other words, there is an everyday, ordinary reality, but, also, a non-ordinary reality lurking just beyond. It requires focus and discipline—or perhaps grace or luck—to glimpse it. Nonetheless, it is there, and we ignore it at our peril.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a 2002 article, <em>Dancing with the Trickster: Notes for a Transpersonal Autobiography</em>, Dr. Krippner explains that “unusual experiences are usually omitted from autobiographies, and yet they are often among the most important of one’s life” (p.1), an idea he reflected from the writings of White (1999). Not only are they omitted from autobiographies, but the fact that we still call these experiences “unusual” suggest that we omit them from our personal histories as well. Stanley tells of an experience he had when he was 14 years old. He had been an avid reader from very early on in his life, and in his words, he “desperately wanted a set of encyclopedias,” but his family was unable to afford such a purchase. When his request was denied, he went to his room and began to cry but then realized that a rich uncle would possibly be able to help him. The thought of getting this help shifted the tears to his planning of possible appeals to his uncle. But the 14-year-old’s attention made another major shift.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Suddenly, I bolted upright in my bed. My psyche swelled and my mind expanded in every direction. I suddenly knew what I was not supposed to know: Uncle Max could not be depended upon because he was dead. At that moment, the telephone rang. My mother answered the phone and, between sobs, told us that my cousin had just called. Uncle Max had taken ill, was rushed to the hospital, and died shortly after his arrival.” (Krippner, 1975, p.1, Krippner, 2002, p.2)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is possible that many of us, sometime during our childhoods, have had experiences in waking life and in dreams that could have opened our hearts and minds to swelling psyches and expanded minds. But we had no external support or internal framework that could have contained such experiences, so we dismissed them and relegated them to unconscious or subconscious places inside us and went about our world-building that did not allow the experiences—ones that our traditional constructs deemed unacceptable—to have a place.</p>

<p>Stanley made a place for the unusual or exceptional experiences that became a significant part of his life. He dreamed of the death of his father a few days before his passing and the death of a dear friend the day that she actually died (Krippner, 2006). In other dreamtime and experiences in “altered states”, he encountered the unfolding of time where he watched his world constructed by words and numbers disintegrate in a cyclone, and then visited Kublai Kan, experienced being in Versailles with Benjamin Franklin, and finally visited Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. He then found himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…at the White House gazing at a bust of Abraham Lincoln; someone whispered, “The President has been shot,” and Lincoln’s visage was replaced by that of John Kennedy. I did not realize that this tragic vision would be actualized less than two years later.” (Krippner, 2002, pp. 8-9)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those of us who have had the privilege to work or just “be” with Stanley—students, colleagues, and peers—it is no surprise that he was given a Native American name, Wichasah Washte, which is Lakota Sioux for “Good Man.” It is, also, no surprise that his family name, Krippner, of German heritage, means “crib-maker,” and that his Irish forebears were named Porter, which translates as “doorkeeper.” Stanley Krippner has been the “good man” who has opened the door for so many who first glimpsed through and then entered the new, expanded worlds. He has spent his life providing a safe place—the crib— for those newly born into the grander worlds that he first envisioned when he, himself, was only eight years old. And he has nurtured so many by giving them the support to walk in strength on their own paths beyond the acceptable and limiting worlds of their past.</p>

<p>For those who did not have an attic filled with mind expanding books that might have taught about mythology and dreams, Stanley wrote the books, so that others shelves could be filled with information that would allow the curious and the skeptic alike to choose to look at unusual experiences from a more expansive place. For those who did not have a “good man” in their growing up years, he became the good man—born into a family of good people—whose personal mythology, he acknowledges, includes a “determination to bring…learning, love, and light” into this world. He explained that he has been a man who has done his best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“…to imitate the Brazilian capoeiristas, connecting with my ‘animal alertness,’ happily dancing, though sometimes clumsily groping my way through life. All the while, I wait for a window of opportunity to make a move on behalf of intelligence, compassion, creativity, integrity, and the other values I hold dear.” (Krippner, 2002, pp. 41-42)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeanne Achterberg, Ph.D. and fellow professor of psychology at Saybrook Graduate School, summed up in her own words, what many colleagues have reflected over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Perhaps unbeknownst to him, Stanley Krippner has been my mentor and role model for decades in matters of scholarship, teaching, and in embodying the essence of human kindness. His open mind and heart are most laudable virtues for a scientist, and his creativity has no bounds. It is a great privilege to be his colleague and friend.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most common response from his former students, when asked about his impact on their lives, was that Dr. Stanley Krippner has been their mentor. Many expressed unending gratitude that he gave them the tools to work with their dreams by introducing them to <a href="../@montagueullman">Dr. Montague Ullman’s</a> method of dream appreciation (Sela-Smith, 2000, Ullman, 1996). Many have used this method, as well as many other processes they learned from taking Stanley’s Personal Mythology course at Saybrook, in working with their clients, as well as in presenting workshops that many of his students, now therapists, teachers, and workshop leaders, present all over the country, and world.</p>

<p>There is no question that Stanley Krippner is a man who has led his life as unencumbered as possible by the rigid rules and standard structures that regulate the seasons of many lives. This writer, along with so many others acknowledge that we consider it our good fortune that this Man Beyond the Seasons, who recorded thousands of his dreams from the time he was a child and has written over one thousand articles, books, and book chapters on extraordinary experiences, had the focus and discipline, as well as the grace and luck to bring understanding to the world beyond the ordinary reality. He has gifted us with his discoveries to allow us to build the internal framework to live our lives more expansively, as does he.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The exploration of how our dreams help us connect with favorable solutions to the challenges of waking life is a central task of dream work. A helpful place to begin or continue such a quest is to look at the dreams that most disturb us. Why? Not because we ought to over-emphasize what feels difficult or that we want to deny the delights to be found in the beauty, joy and pleasure of our dreams or waking lives. Rather, we may tend to want to sidestep the many rough-edged images, scenarios and circumstances that we find in our thorny dream experiences and amid the obstacles of daily life. When we can face “all that is,” our experience opens us up to a more robust, fulfilling sense of being alive.</p>

<p>My mind and heart are deeply encouraged when I read Paco Mitchell’s beseeching commentary from the Winter 2013 issue of DNJ, in which I perceive him to be making an invitation for honoring what I’ll call the trials present in dreams. His words ring out as a call to engagement, “We must be willing to stare into the face of troubling, even intolerable, images… This truth-telling aspect of dreams, their ‘negativity’ is what makes them regenerative engines of salvation and conveyors of divine wisdom.”<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Not long ago, I was invited to speak about working with dreams and sound healing on a radio program, which seeks to honor the intellect in relation to spiritual disciplines. The interviewers asked how I got into doing dream work as a profession. A dream from childhood stirred to the surface and I shared this early experience as an example of a vision that bespeaks elements of a vocational mission.</p>

<p>The dream, which appeared to me at age four, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Eagle Who Darkens the Sky</strong> </p>
  
  <p><em>In the dream, I’m in the back yard of my childhood home, lifting up and down on the swing-set. As I rise higher and higher and feel the elation that comes with the promise of flight, I view an enormous eagle up in the sky. As it approaches, it blots out the sun with its imposing body. I know that it’s going to release its bowels and that nothing I can do to avoid this liquid white-brown mass as it descends to the earth will allow me to survive the suffocating effects of its arrival. I see that the powerful bird’s far-reaching projectile of fecund waste is headed right for me and will consume the surrounding DNJ/ Spring 2014 19 houses and fields. The thought of running occurs to me, but I understand that trying to escape won’t help. There’s no time and I know I can’t move fast or far enough. I waken with the telltale emotions of a nightmare, terrified.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When sharing this dream on the radio program, I became quite self-conscious about naming the <em>dark matter</em> in the dream, the eagle’s excrement. My hosts also seemed uncomfortable having the topic introduced during the interview. The reluctance to face such direct dream messages, however, is exactly what we want to be dealing with. As Carl Jung is well known for saying, the darkness we avoid within tends to become fixed in the form of outer fate in our waking lives. This notion rings true in my experience.</p>

<p>I relay the dream here to illustrate the way that, even as children, we are invited by our dreams to honor such exigent energies. If the dreaming source is capable of determining that even a child’s mind, heart, soul and body are up to the task of going through difficult dreams like this one, it would seem to be true that we can work helpfully with and learn from them. This dream potentially raises the question for all of us: what dreams have we witnessed in which we are being asked to engage? Dreams which have challenged us? Such dreaming experiences hold the very energy we need in order to find solutions to our lives and for relating to their essential messages about how to embody a full breadth of wholeness. Paradoxically, these troubling scenarios are also the ones we might overlook due to their repulsive quality. Often, we might wish to put away difficult dreams in favor of more pleasant, sparkling visions and images.</p>

<p><a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> has made “facing up” to disquieting dreams a primary principle of his projective-style dream work by declaring, “What is true of nightmares is true of all dreams: what is remembered is worth remembering because it always contains valuable information. All dreams bring us creative energies and insights into the meaning of confusing emotions.”<sup>2</sup> When teaching in public, and in his revelatory writings, Taylor adds that this doesn’t mean the dreams or associated feelings aren’t difficult to witness and undergo.</p>

<p>The above dream, “The Eagle Who Darkens the Sky”, provides an example of a guiding vision, which has informed a lifelong quest for purpose and meaning. It also contains several universal symbols and flavors. Ancient and contemporary teachings state that we each receive at least one glimpse behind the veil of our soul’s deep yet hidden agreements made prior to this lifetime in our youth. These intuitive spiritual hunches and forms of instruction based on experience say that we tend to forget our larger vocations through the necessities of being and becoming human via the rigorous process of socialization.</p>

<p>Mythologies and folktales, the world over, speak to this proclivity for a kind of <em>amnesia</em> in relation to the Divine. Robert Bly discusses this forgetfulness in his and Marion Woodman’s book about a Russian fairy tale <em>The Maiden King</em>. In that tale, it’s Ivan’s fate to fall asleep when the divine feminine appears. There are countless other such wisdom tales to be found in various cultures.</p>

<p>Dreams are spontaneous <em>mythic</em> expressions that touch into and express the personal and then reach down to the transpersonal, collectively unconscious domains of existence. My own vision, “The Eagle Who Darkens the Sky” depicts a great mythic struggle. The appearance of this larger-than-life dream raptor suggests the presence of the Divine in the budding life of a young boy, which symbolically could be said to typify the tone of any meeting between human and sacred energies, a <em>dream challenge</em>. In this encounter, the more limited, small self is met and confronted by the powerful, large, limitless forces of spirit, soul and nature.</p>

<p>The energy of swinging in the dream evokes the possibility of flight, and therefore, freedom. The scene and setting in the dream also exemplify the essence of descent, gravity and <em>life on the ground</em>. It reflects the reality and relationship of opposites. Here <em>humanness</em> and <em>animal-as-divine-archetype</em> meet one another in the dreaming. The eternal dance of light and dark, as enacted in the dream, with the sun being covered by the flying creature’s body is central and attention-grabbing. The little and the big, that which is grounded and that which is in flight, and the energy of the invitation to learn how to be between, enlarged, within and encircled by both - all are brought forward in the encounter betwixt the eagle and the boy, rising and falling amid earth and heaven.</p>

<p>The threat contained in my childhood eagle dream is common to nightmares: the impending arrival of this bird’s shadowy gift brings with it the understanding that the dreamer will suffer and possibly die. Marie-Louise von Franz has spoken lucidly about this, “Every dark thing one falls into can be called an initiation. To be initiated into a thing means to go into it… The shamans say that being a medicine man (or woman) begins by falling into the power of the demons.<sup>3</sup> <em>(parentheses added)</em> The dream eagle from my vision, then, may be seen as demonic, in the sense that it poses a gruesome, dark menace to the dreamer, who experiences the fall/descent in relation to the animal spirit power above him.</p>

<p>Traditional cultures maintain practices that bestow this kind of initiatory experience through quests for vision. The initiate in these rites of passage makes contact with spirit animals or beings who put him or her through an ordeal whose purpose is to enlarge the personality beyond what we could name as ordinary human ego concerns.</p>

<p>This classic archetypal occurrence is often portrayed in the immanence of some form of <em>dream-death</em>, whose other face is the renewing provenance of rebirth. My dream eagle comes to say that there are trials to endure and that there will be lifelong invitations to surrender to spirit, which will offer up the vital potencies of transformation. Spirit, as represented in the dream, contains fiercely destructive and potentially beneficent powers. Perhaps a true looking into the face of such depth energies always reveals this level of paradox in the search for wholeness by displaying these powers of creation and destruction.</p>

<p>The words of the poet Rilke describe these motifs accurately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Just as the winged energy of delight carried you over many chasms early on, now raise the daringly imagined arch holding up the astounding bridges. Miracle doesn’t lie only in the amazing living through and defeat of danger. Miracles are miracles in the clear achievement that is earned.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In communicating these direct symbolic experiences, the dream says that there will be plenty of “crap” to deal with and it won’t be easy. The source of this bountiful darkness, however, especially as it relates to the pursuit of becoming a more fully embodied, spirited human being, is <em>nature</em>, as typified by the animal-person of the eagle in the dream and the surrounding energy of the sky, the sun, the darkness, the yard, and the nearby fields. If the dreamer can learn from this form of <em>suffering</em> (a word whose root meaning is “to undergo” or “go under”) through implied suffocation, the pursuit of genuine freedom—an integral embodiment—may be realized. This tribulation teaches the ability to be under something demanding, and thereby to understand or stand under it, and to potentially break through the inherent hazards of life to a previously unseen threshold of growth and new life.</p>

<p>This study of troubling dreams also calls forth the words of Archetypal Psychologist, James Hillman, who reflects, “The <em>worst</em> images are the <em>best</em>, for they are the ones that restore a figure to its pristine power as a numinous person at work in the soul.”<sup>4</sup> The paradoxical quality innately woven into the trying images and experiences in the above dream, and all dreams, is a living energy that demands recognition. The <em>trouble</em> stands out so starkly as to require being acknowledged and, through this, sanctity is found.</p>

<p>How many of us have had similar guiding dreams and how might they have helped to shape and inform the lives that we’ve led and will lead? Have we been, are we now, and will we be attentive to recalling and working with them? How might they help and inspire others?</p>

<p>That four year-old boy was trying to return to the sky, to the pure world of spirit. Spirit appeared and said, “No, not now. Now is the time for personifying the fertilizing, gravity-laden and humbling energies of matter, dark and troublesome as these may be. This is the task, and this is the great effort… within such an invitation lies a hidden gift.” That treasure continues to unfold in my own life, as I realize that the boons of the dream have offered the felt sense of being able to meet similar obstacles both awake and asleep. This dream gave an orientation early on for the life of one who would eventually come to work with comparable energies in the lives of others and pursue an unconventional path of specializing in dreams and inner work as a professional pursuit.</p>

<p>Nowadays we may tend to think, as a “modern” culture, that we’ve lost a true connection with valid spiritual disciplines. This may be true on some level. It’s also true that our dreams are always presenting us with opportunities for entering into blood-filled, authentically sacred, transformative initiations that influence the entire course of our lives and all the life we’re surrounded and supported by. If only we are willing to pay attention to, reflect upon, share and pull closer into their confusing and often off-putting flavors, images and energies, the dreams will guide us. When we honor even our troubling visions, we can then be further acquainted with how the theater of the imagination, taking place in our dreams, is beckoning us into ever-deepening, spontaneous and life-giving ceremonies of enormously enriching and fertile proportions.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Let me begin by explaining that I am one of those people who firmly believes that death is not the end, but a passage to and a beginning of life in another dimension. I am convinced that all living beings have a soul that will live on after death and from this non-material space can send messages to the people left behind. </p>

<p>These communications can be transmitted in a variety of ways. For example, the one from my dad, who—on his deathbed—promised me he would let me know if there was life after death by coming back and stirring up my cats. And—oh my!—how they screeched six weeks after he died, running down the stairs with their coats so puffed out they looked about twice their normal size. I thought: ‘Thank you dad, point taken’, after which the cats (and their coats) went back to normal and a bit of my feelings of loss were healed. But that was real-life, not a dream. </p>

<p>In 1992, a friend died suddenly in a car-crash abroad. I felt guilty about his death because before leaving he had consulted me on whether or not he should take up a foreign job offer. He was in two minds about the decision. On one hand, he wanted to go; the job-market in his line of work was really bad at that time and this would be an opportunity for him to get a well-paid position. On the other hand, he felt obliged to stay and look after his mother; he was an only child and his father had passed just a couple of months earlier. I had told him that he should, of course, make up his own mind, but that in my opinion, accepting the job might be a boon for both his career and personal growth. So he decided to take the job, left the country, and was killed in the car-crash only a few months later. </p>

<p>For several reasons I didn’t attend his funeral, although I thought about him a lot throughout the day. I remember feeling very sad for his mother, who’d lost both her husband and her son within a couple of months of one another and thinking how unfair life can seem to be. That night I dreamt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>B arrives at my house, driving a bright red convertible. He’s in a great mood, says he’s come to pick me up, wanting to spend the day with me. I look at him, asking him: “You’re dead. How can you be here when you’re dead?” He answers: “But I’m not. I’m not dead. There was a mistake made with my date of birth. Look.” He shows me his passport and indeed there is an incorrect birth-date in it. So I get into the car and we drive around, having a great time together.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream helped me come to terms with my feelings of guilt about his death, and experience all the stages of mourning.</p>

<p>Although over time this existence-after-death idea became a firm conviction of mine, I seemed to be unable to tap into it when in 2012 someone very dear to me died unexpectedly—at quite a young age—of a previously undiagnosed cardiac disorder. </p>

<p>Looking at his seemingly unimpaired body, I went into a state of shock, being unable to cry or otherwise express my feelings. I spent three days numbly moving around, with this gaping hole in the middle of me. Clinging to every tiny shred of everyday life, I attempted to get the chores done, trying to stay on the sane side of life, while being in full shut-down mode, both emotionally and brain-wise. </p>

<p>While in this state, I had the following dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m standing outside my house and look up. It is sunny, the sky is a clear blue with white clouds. I notice a sheet of white Styrofoam that moves high up on the wind. The sheet floats and tumbles, rises, drops down and tumbles again. I keep looking at the movements for a long time, getting a feeling of enormous freedom and utter joy while doing so.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dream left me with a sense of freedom, the sensation and joy of being able to move on the wind weightlessly, not being encumbered by a body or any other type of mass. While contemplating the dream, I interpreted it as seeing a soul going up to heaven, experiencing—and in this case sharing—the weightlessness, carefreeness and a sense of bliss; the dead person telling me it was okay, he was okay, he was feeling exuberant.</p>

<p>After this dream, I came out of shut-down, was able to cry, to feel the sadness of losing someone precious, and at the same time, realizing life doesn’t stop at death and might even be quite enjoyable once we arrive on the other side. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this was a very young person dying unexpectedly. There wasn’t only sadness; of course, there was anger as well. The next night I dreamt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m having a terrific row with three very haughty ladies. They have their hair piled up high on their heads and wear expensive dresses and jewelry. I find them pompous.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>I feel they’ve done me a great injustice and want them to understand that. I am so angry I could ram their heads through the wall. I shout at them at the top of my voice, but they don’t react. I feel utterly frustrated about that. I then realize that what I’m doing is completely useless, they don’t show any reaction whatsoever.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took me a while to realize that in this dream I was spending a hell of a lot of energy shouting at the Fates. Who, of course, never reacted, precisely because they were the Fates. So, I decided I’d better look up and re-read the text in Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (King James’ version), which in all its wisdom did help me to make the loss more bearable. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what better bearer of peace than a message from beyond the veil, assuring us that this life is not all there is and there will be a time to begin anew in another dimension of our everlasting existence? ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Bring to mind how different life seemed when you were younger? Your perspective on the world, your beliefs about What you could accomplish, your sense of what was important may have all transformed as you have developed. Reflection on these changes brings into focus the aspect of mental life that has been termed <em>personal mythology</em>. This concept is useful for assisting individuals in keeping their consciousness attuned to the unending demands made upon it by a rapidly changing world and by the ongoing psychological dilemmas life presents. </p>

<p>Personal myths are complex internal structures that determine how we experience the world. A personal mythology is an individual's ever-changing system of complimentary and conflicting personal myths, and it provides the wider context which shapes perceptions, thoughts, and ultimately actions. The models we carry in our heads influence every possibility we see and every choice we make, and these internalized models are products of our personal mythology. They are more than self concept, more than scripts, and more than value systems, dynamically addressing each of these fundamental questions of identity: "Who am I" (self-concept); "Where am I going?" (scripting); and "Why?" (beliefs and values). They govern our perceptions, our cognitions, and thus our behavior. </p>

<p>Mythology has been seen as a venerable source of psychological guidance in the complex choices faced by human beings across cultures and throughout time. The history of this ancient concept is said to provide a record of the development of human consciousness. Mythology stands on the recognition that our notions about the world are, in fact, <strong>not</strong> fact, but an interplay of perceptions and culturally influenced internal models for interpreting those perceptions. A myth is not a falsehood but a way of interpreting reality that may ultimately be judged as being functional or dysfunctional for an individual's wholesome development at a particular point in time. The logic found in mythologies throughout cultures throughout time is perhaps the closest reflection in existence of the complex workings of the human mind. Revitalizing the deep significance of this powerful, ancient concept is particularly appropriate at this point in history because it enhances the vitality of our psychological explanations while reflecting the hypothetical nature inherent in any construct of reality. </p>

<p>What is a personal myth? Is it a story? Is it a personal lifestyle? Is it an attitude? It is not identical to any of these, yet it is at the core of each of them. Each is a reflection of an underlying personal myth. A personal myth is a schema, a template, a colored lens through which we see our world and our role in it, a cookie-cutter through which we stamp out our own version of reality from the undifferentiated cosmic dough. </p>

<p>The most appropriate scientific model for understanding personal myths comes from the field of cognitive psychology which provides the concept of the cognitive structure. Cognitive structures are internalized schemata for understanding or for performing activities. Personal myths are those cognitive structures that serve the functions of explaining, guiding, and sacralizing for an individual in a manner that is analogous to the way cultural myths serve those functions for a society. Personal mythology provides a context which, while operating largely outside our conscious awareness, produces the unfolding drama or our mental lives. </p>

<p>See if you can identify the conflicting personal myths that are dominating the inner life of the woman described in the following scenario. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Betty is a 34-year-old mother of two small children. Her days are filled with the chores of being good mother, housewife, and citizen. Her friends view her clan as a model family. While Betty appears happy, inner turmoil has been developing. It seemed to start with a dream: There is a bird in a nest, resting content, feeding its beautiful babies, when a strong wind comes up and, after great struggle, blows the bird away into a terrifying unknown. Very upset by this dream, Betty starts having trouble sleeping. She becomes irritable. She beings to feel constantly troubled, and she finds that her temper is growing shorter and shorter with her children and her husband. The harder she tries to keep things smooth, the more depressed she gets, until she has almost no energy. She describes these concerns to her physician who suggests she make a better adjustment to the demands of her role and gives her antidepressant medication. The drugs do give her more energy and in a subsequent visit he suggests she get out of the house and become more active in the community. She is elected President of the PTA and joins two committees in her church. At times she feels a chronic pain in the back of her neck. She notices that this pain decreases when she yells at her kids, but then she feels guilty and has stomach discomfort. She starts having fantasies about going on archeological digs and begins to read avidly about travel. These fantasies trouble her and she takes on greater responsibilities with the PTA and her church until she has virtually no time for herself. Her temper grows shorter, she starts having a recurrent dream about suffocating, and she begins to wonder if she is having a nervous breakdown. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, Betty's conflicting mythologies found expression in her dreams, fantasies, thought content, emotional reactions, behaviours, and even somatic changes. We can see in Betty's case how, when a prevailing myth becomes dysfunctional or otherwise outdated, the psyche may generate a new myth, and each may compete for dominance of the individual's perceptions, thoughts, and behaviors. Betty's ordeal was aggravated substantially by her suppression of the emerging myth from her conscious awareness. Had she attended to the first dream with a valid guiding perspective on the development of her inner life - or to any of a host of other signals - she could have worKed with the conflict in a much more direct, effective, and less disruptive manner. </p>

<p>Understanding the nature of personal mythology is a way of gaining such a perspective on the development of your inner life. Because personal myths are a class of cognitive structure, they function according to lawful patterns of development which have been scientifically described and can be deliberately influenced by the individual. As we mature, dysfunctional myths become increasingly detrimental, and prevailing myths which at one time provided beneficial guidance may also become outdated for our optimum development. At these times, the psyche does generate a counter-mythology based on life experiences that contradict the old myth, the ongoing processing of input from the wider culture, and transcendent experiences that may be revealed in dreams, inspirations, or peak moments. The emerging myth organizes perceptions and thoughts in a different way than the prevailing myth, and a conflict may be set into motion deep within the psyche. The more we are able to maintain an awareness of the dynamics of this conflict, the more we are able to maintain a harmony with the natural process by which our consciousness evolves. Skills in worKing with our own dreams, imagery, mental conflicts, and behavioral contradictions provide us with an opportunity for a productive resolution of the competing mythologies, finally anchoring into our lifestyles a new myth that integrates the most functional aspects of the prevailing myth with the most beneficial from the counter-myth. </p>

<p>These skills can be systematized and taught to the public based on current knowledge from the field of cognitive psychology placed within a broader mythological perspective. It is at the points of change or dysfunction that it is most useful to focus on the underlying mythology and related conflicts that may be in progress. From each individual a mythology can be mined that is a rich in symbolic content as the myths of cultures - indeed the myths of cultures originate in the interplay of the psyches of that culture's members and its history - and by understanding the dynamics of their own personal myths individuals are able to take an increasingly participatory role in shaping their own destinies. Because of the inextricable relationship between personal and cultural mythology, such understanding also provides citizens with sKills for examining, relating to, and influencing the ongoing development of the myths of their culture. </p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>

<p><em>Treating myth-making as the vehicle through which consciousness is given form, this paper traces historical evidence indicating that mythology, consciousness, and culture have evolved in concert. No longer are myths conveyed by a single storyteller around a campfire. Each person in ancient times was wedded to the mythology of the tribe, but modern cultures do not have a single unifying mythology. Today, numerous competing myths and fragments of myths vie for people's attention and allegiance. Our senses are bombarded by diverse mythic images that are simultaneously flashed around the world. These developments allow and, in fact, force people to think for themselves in ways that were unimaginable in the past. Mythmaking, and the spiritual concerns that have always been the province of mythology, have increasingly become the responsibility of the individual. Developments leading to this "personalizing" of mythology, and their implications, are discussed.</em></p>

<h2>PART ONE</h2>

<p>Piaget identified three types of knowledge: 1) innate knowledge, such as drives and instincts, 2) knowledge of the physical world, based on sensory perception and 3) cognitive structures that are a product of reflective abstraction on the other two. The view that human behavior and experiences are mediated by cognitive structures- that people's responses are reactions not to stimuli but to their interpretation of stimuli - has become a pivotal concept in contemporary psychological thought. In a series of works, my colleagues and I have suggested that understanding consciousness in terms of the individual's evolving personal mythology augments and refines this cognitive approach by conceptually embracing the intuitive realm and the spiritual impulse in conceiving the individual's assumptive world.</p>

<h2>MYTHOLOGY AS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY</h2>

<p>The anthropologist Eugene d'Aquili coined the term "cognitive imperative" to describe the human compulsion to order reality in a meaningful manner. According to d'Aquili, this universal, biologically-rooted human drive to organize unexplained external stimuli into a meaningful form is a critical element of humanity's evolutionary advantage over other creatures, and it was "the last development required for the emergence of culture". By drawing upon mythology to understand the fulfilment of the cognitive imperative, we break out of the conceptually linear shackles of the cognitive structure and enter the conceptually expansive world that has always been the domain of mythology. </p>

<p>Myths have been described as large controlling images that organize experience and direct action (Schorer 1960). In the sense we are using the terms, myths are not falsehoods. Nor are they legends, stories, attitudes, or beliefs, but each of these may reflect deeper mythic processes. Nor are myths only the product of archaic thought of primitive peoples. As Joseph Campbell put it, "The latest incarnation of Oedipus, the continued romance of Beauty and the Beast, stand this afternoon on the corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change". According to Marian, it "is not that modern man has become any less mythic, but that he has unconsciously lived the myths of logic and science. These myths unduly restrict the deepening of human consciousness and help to foster the feelings of alienation and 'exile' so common in modern times".</p>

<p>Myth-making, at both the individual and the collective level, is the primary though often unperceived psychological mechanism by which human beings order reality and navigate their way through life. As the human species evolved, mythological thinking - the ability to symbolically address large questions- replaced genetic mutation as the primary vehicle by which individual consciousness and societal innovations were carried forward. Unlike terms such as scripts, beliefs, or cognitive structures, myth is able to embrace the intuitive and spiritual dimensions of human consciousness that elude many of the constructs psychologists have used to describe the core components of experience. </p>

<p>Cognitive structures assume mythic proportions as they begin to address the issues identified by Joseph Campbell as the primary domains in which mythic thought functions: 1) the need to comprehend one's world in a meaningful way, 2) the search for a marked pathway through the succeeding epochs of human life, 3) the urgency to establish secure and fulfilling relationships within a community, and 4) the longing to know one's part in the vast wonder and mystery of the cosmos. Personal myths explain the world, guide individual development, provide social direction, and address spiritual longings in a manner analogous to the way cultural myths carry out these functions for entire societies. Personal myths do for an individual what cultural myths do for a community. </p>

<p>Personal myths are the product of four interacting sources. The most obvious are biology (the capacities for symbolism and narrative are rooted in the structure of the brain, information and attitudes are neurochemically coded, temperament and hormones influence belief systems, etc.), culture (the individual's mythology is, to an extent, the culture's mythology in microcosm), and personal history (every emotionally significant event leaves a mark on one's developing mythology). A fourth source is rooted in transcendent experiences - those episodes, insights, dreams and visions that have a numinous quality, expand a person's perspective, and inspire behavior. Transcendent experiences vary in their strength and significance. Their most profound form is in the full-blown mystical or religious experience. William James reported that "mystical states of a well-pronounced and emphatic sort are usually authoritative over those who have them... Mystical experiences are as direct perceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations ever were for us". For Philip Wheelwright, "the very essence of myth" is "that haunting awareness of transcendental forces peering through the cracks of the visible universe". </p>

<p>Personal and cultural myths evolve according to lawful principles. A theory of cognitive evolution proposed by D. Campbell holds that historical changes in cognitive products (such as language, art and science) is determined by an evolutionary process that meets three criteria. First there must be variation. In the case of biological evolution, variation is supplied by such factors as mutation. In the case of cognitive evolution, variation is insured by group and individual differences in memory, learning, and the combination of elements into new syntheses. The second necessary factor is selection; some consistent process must operate to favor one trait over another. In biology, a more adaptive trait increases the probability that its possessors will survive and reproduce. In cognitive evolution, the ideas that are reinforced (because they are interesting, useful, or pleasurable) tend to survive. Finally, there must be <em>retention</em> for evolution to occur. In biology, sexual reproduction insures that the traits selected are retained and passed on to others. In cognitive evolution, language and ideas are learned from other people. These principles are applicable as we explore the historical processes by which mythology, consciousness, and culture have evolved in concert.</p>

<h2>The EVOLUTION Of CONSCIOUSNESS as the PERSONALIZING Of MYTHOLOGY</h2>

<p>In previous works, my colleagues and I reviewed literature showing that over the course of human evolution, the epicenter of consciousness and, thus, the locus of myth-making has expanded from the life of the body to include the consensual reality of the group and, in recent history, the vested concerns of the individual ego. Thus, a distinguishing feature of the modern era in technologically advanced Western cultures is that people have achieved greater autonomy than ever before in formulating the myths that guide their lives. The main points of those arguments are presented here in greater detail, along with a discussion of the advantages and the challenges this development poses to the culture's evolving mythology. </p>

<p>Biologist Lewis Thomas noted that "our most powerful story, equivalent in its way to a universal myth, is evolution". One of the most provocative facts about human evolution is that while the structure of the brain has remained essentially unchanged for at least 40,000 years, consciousness has evolved dramatically for the human species; language and myth-making replaced genetic mutation as the primary mechanisms by which individual awareness and societal innovations were carried forward. Times of transformation in the nature of the myths people hold are milestones in the evolution of human consciousness and are at the hub of historical change. </p>

<p>Jean Gebser has described the historical unfolding of four major "structures of consciousness" which he termed the Archaic, the Magical, the Mythic, and the Rational - the latter being the current era where consciousness is dominated by the rational, self-reflecting, individual ego. We will follow Ken Wilber's astute synthesis of Gebser with Freud, Jung, Piaget, Joseph Campbell, Erich Neumann, Ernst Cassirer, L.L.Whyte, and Julian Jaynes in surveying these four major "epochs" in the growth of consciousness and examining how the creating of guiding myths had become an increasingly personal matter... in the next issue. </p>

Here, we will look at three of these four mythological 'Epochs'. Part three (in the next issue) will conclude this study.</em></p>

<h2>The Archaic Epoch</h2>

<p>Some three million years ago, humanlike creatures were making tools and walking on two legs. Ken Wilber portrays humanity's earliest eras as involving no sense of self separate from the experience of the body; the first stages of human evolution were "dominated by physical nature and animal body". The earliest humans were immersed in the subconscious realms of their biological existence in what anthropologists have termed a <em>participation mystique</em>. They did not experience themselves as separate from their surroundings. Self and world were "basically undifferentiated, embedded, fused and confused". Wilber speculates that out of this primitive unity, with no capacity for verbal representation or true mental reflection yet developed, there could be no experience of anxiety (fear of that which is not present), no real comprehension of death, and thus no existential fears.</p>

<p>Sagan has wondered if "the Garden of Eden is not so different from Earth as it appeared to our ancestors of some three or four million years ago, during a legendary golden age when the genus <em>Homo</em> was perfectly interwoven with the other beasts and vegetables. These [Eden myths] all correspond reasonably well to the historical and archaeological evidence". Neumann noted that this period, which is represented mythologically as the uroboros (a serpent biting its own tail), "corresponds to the psychological stage in man's prehistory when the individual and the group, ego and unconscious, man and the world, were so indissolubly bound up with one another that the law of participation mystique, of unconscious identity, prevailed between them". </p>

<p>The Archaic Epoch roughly parallels the infantile "sensorimotor period" hypothesized by Piaget. During this period of their development, children are unable to differentiate between themselves and anything else in the world. They do not distinguish between inner and outer, between stimuli that come from their own bodies, such as hunger, and those that come from the outside, such as light. If we may speak of cultural myths at all during this period, we would call this the dreamlike era of a <em>unified, primordial bodymyth</em>. Consciousness was fully identified with the life of the body - the two were isomorphic. Instinctual impulses and conditioned responses functioned without competition from "higher" mental processes in motivating these protohumans. Reality was structured primarily around the pleasures, the pains, and the perceptions emerging from one's biological self. Thoughts regarding the aspects of life that concern mythology, such as identity and purpose, were direct and concrete. The life of the body was the life of myth. As Freud once noted, the ego is "first and foremost a body-ego".</p>

<h2>The Magical Epoch</h2>

<p>It was probably not until 200,000 years ago, with the Neanderthals, that the ability to clearly differentiate between oneself and one's environment began to emerge, although the ability may not have become fully developed, according to Wilber, until as late as 10,000 B.C. Adam and Eve's mythical "Fall" and departure from the Garden of Eden may be likened to the shift to this epoch. Human beings "fell" from their close identity with nature, and "fell" into self awareness with its accompanying anxiety, guilt, pain and vulnerability. Houston has speculated that the infant, after birth, may recapitulate the Archaic Epoch "in some thirty months equivalent to" that whole stage of humanity's development. And then the Fall. The realization that there is a dividing line between self and the rest of the world robs the infant of his or her innocent sense of omnipotence. The most elemental personal myth, constructed from the Eden-like peace of the embryo's unity in the womb, is rudely shattered with the first taste of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the dawning of selfconsciousness. According to Houston, as individual consciousness arose, myths of Paradise and the Fall developed, which she has interpreted as the "widespread nostalgia for the integral world of the childhood in man". </p>

<p>Wilber explains that out of the "almost' paradisical' state of dreamy immersion" in the world of nature came the awakening of a highly individual awareness and a 'loss' of a primitive slumber". He uses the mythological image of the Typhon, half man and half snake, to represent the epoch. Typhon, son of Gaia, the Greeks' Earth goddess, had separated himself from the Earth but his mind and body were still unified. While people of this era were no longer totally immersed in nature, events in dreams were considered to be as real as waking experiences, and artistic images were accorded the same validity as the objects they represented. The animal paintings found in Paleolithic caves are thought to bear silent witness to the magical rituals used to insure success in hunting, in which art and object are fused. </p>

<p>Reality in this era was patterned after the recognition of "me" and "other," and it was experienced in the trance-like relationship of the newly-emerged self to the world. Wilber emphasizes that during this period, the self, while distinguished from the natural environment "remains magically intermingled with it". The self has become differentiated from the environment in these early stages of mental evolution, but it is still embedded in and undifferentiated from the body, it is still a "bodyself." While the distinction between person and environment has come into being, the boundary is still fluid and porous. Subject and object, image and reality, are not yet fully differentiated in this era. People are at the center of their world and magically intermingled with it. An object was treated as the same as the image of it, a word the same as what it represented, a dream the same as the events it portrays. A man dreaming would not think of the dream as a construction or a symbol, but rather as something which actually occurred in the "other world". Studies of traditional cultures suggest that he might be compelled to retaliate for the harm done, though his revenge might also take place in a· dream or other symbolic form. To manipulate the symbol, according to this magical logic, was to affect the object symbolized. Wilber elaborates: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"That magical world, primitive but real enough, which in us moderns has been relegated to the state of dreaming, was apparently conscious in our remote ancestors. As Freud put it, <em>'What once dominated waking life, while the mind was still young and incompetent, seems now to have been banished into the night'</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the child's development, the Magical Epoch roughly parallels Piaget's "preoperational period". Four year old children are typically embedded in their perceptions, but are no longer at the mercy of them. Children at this stage cannot distinguish between image and reality; they cannot easily be consoled by being told "but it's only a dream." They believe that if they make a wish, it will be granted-and they are upset when this logic proves to be faulty. In a similar manner, humans in the Magical Epoch were convinced that their rituals brought back the sun when it disappeared during an eclipse, or that their sacrifices prevented earthquakes and other disaster. </p>

<p>This epoch, in which consciousness is not as differentiated as it will become in subsequent mythological expressions, might be thought of as the <em>magical era of mythic participation</em>. The self had emerged from its environment and was magically participating in its newly discovered world, but this involvement was laced with magical beliefs that blurred the relationship between inner and outer life in self-aggrandizing ways. In this stage, the primitive mythology of the clan or the tribe defined the nature of the magic that permeated life, and it dictated how individuals would participate in that magic. The mythic structuring of reality at this time was still bound by the body, it still antedated cognitive thought, but an external world was now recognized and responsibility for events could be assigned to it. the foundation of a mythology that separates self from other had now emerged, but the far-reaching implications of its development were yet to be realized.</p>

<h2>The Mythical Epoch</h2>

<p>Where the development of the oppositional thumb made possible the use of complex tools, the ability to conceptualize the difference between "self" and "other" prepared the way for such cognitive abilities as delaying one's responses, planning for the future, and becoming aware of death. By the time of the Cro-Magnons some 50,000 years ago, the brain had increased in size, become reorganized neurologically, and sophisticated forms of language had emerged. According to some informed estimates, however, language sophistication reached its full influence only as recently as 10,000 B.C. </p>

<p>At that time, according to Wilber, cognitive abilities had expanded so that people were able to anticipate the future more accurately, and thus plan and farm for it. "Still close to the lilies of the field, mankind took no extended thought of the morrow, and therefore neither toiled nor tilled the earth". But when tribes that had once subsisted on hunting and gathering began to settle down and cultivate crops, the anthropological evidence is unequivocal that they "sustained the most prodigious mutation in consciousness that had yet appeared". The world of agriculture is the world of extended time, of making preparations for the future harvest, and gearing the actions of the present toward important goals. The farmer had to learn how to control, postpone, and sublimate instinctive body-bound activities for the benefit of the crop. With language, the verbal mind could differentiate itself . more definitely from the physical body. People began to understand that the word is not the object for which it stands. The physical world could be represented and manipulated through mental symbols. All the requirements for developing sophisticated mythologies had become available. The hard-earned knowledge and deeper insights of the elders could now be represented in myth and carried to new generations by means of story and ritual.</p>

<p>In Wilber's scheme, language was the major psychological vehicle for this new development in consciousness. He presents evidence showing that humankind possessed no truly developed language during the magical era, and was thus structurally incapable of projecting into the future or of organizing itself in large membership communities. But "because language transcends the present, the new self could transcend the body. Because language transcends the given, the new self could see into tomorrow. Because language embodies mental goals and futures, the new self could delay and channel its bodily desires". With language, people could rise above " the prison of the immediate" and envision long-term goals. "From this point on, humanity would be able to reproduce itself not just physically (food) and biologically (sex) but also culturally (mind). For the reproduction of the human mind, generation to generation, is an act of <em>verbal communication</em>". </p>

<p>In this Mythic Epoch, personal mythologies closely mirrored the mythology of the culture. Individuals had not yet fully developed the mental capacities required for self-reflection. This period resembles the child's "concrete-operational" stage in Piaget's schema. The 10 year-old child is able to categorize concrete objects and make simple inferences. More objective than the preoperational child, these children are still unable to consider meanings outside the concrete world or to contemplate on the design behind the phenomena they can observe. Human beings in the Mythic Epoch were able to engage in social learning but were not able to reflectively establish much perspective on what was being passed down to them. If a person violated a taboo or other norm of the group-even if the infraction were due to some unusual and unavoidable situation-the person typically would be punished, and there would be no question in anyone's mind that the punishment was justified. Without the capacity for self-reflection, the individual is not yet capable of questioning the social code, nor would the group be in a position to make allowances for extenuating circumstances. Ashley Montagu noted that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"in non-literate societies the acts of the individual are believed by everyone to have consequences for the group as a whole; hence, the individual tends to regulate his conduct by the recognition of his social responsibility to the group". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the development of language and of community relationships that in some ways transcended the powers of nature, mythology came into full bloom, and the results can be observed in the stunning mythic tales of such areas as ancient China, Crete, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, India, Mexico, and Peru. As the verbal mind climbed out from the body, the accumulated wisdom of the group as communicated by myth, gave structure to the mind's extraordinarily flexible capacity for defining reality. These myths were carried to new generations via language as well as other cultural forms such as art, ritual and religious and civic practices. The individual's emerging sense of self took the form prescribed by the culture's mythology. During this era, the cultural myths that structure reality were all-important and all-pervasive. In this pre-rational, pre-personal era of cultural mythology, the society's mythology reigned supreme. </p>

<p>Wilber describes the next stage of evolution in terms of a "final differentiation and crystallization of the mind out of the body". In the earlier stages, responsibility for one's fate was lodged primarily in the external world and its objects, which Gebser interprets as "a sure sign of egolessness." Now the separate ego, the sense of a personal self that is the core of the modern individual's identity, had emerged from its previous embeddedness in nature. Based upon a provocative analysis of the historical record, the psychologist Julian Jaynes concluded that prior to the second millennium B.C., humanity had not yet developed the self-reflecting ego that characterizes modern consciousness. Surveying the use of linguistic metaphors, Jaynes speculated that only between the second and first millennia B.C. in the Western World had an "I" developed that could form inner narratives and consider alternative actions. This shift corresponds to the writing of the New Testament, where the relationship with God had become personal rather than to the Old Testament, where God's covenant was with the people of Israel. Whether or not Jaynes' dates and thesis regarding the implications of his source documents are correct, the development of an independent sense of self operating as a self-reflecting agent has been one of the crowning achievements of evolution. </p>

<p>L.L. Whyte noted that as individuals became more self-conscious, their decisions were increasingly dominated and controlled by the particular form of their own thought processes rather than "primarily by instinctive responses to external stimuli and by mimicry of the forms of a stable social tradition". Instinctive and traditional reactions to the outer world were no longer the only available guides for behavior and the internal structures we are calling "personal myths" increasingly became the basis of decision-making. Wilber suggests that close examination of the collective mythologies at the beginning of the "egoic" period unequivocally reveals that an entirely different form of myth began to appear - the "Hero Myth." He notes "the true hero myths do not emerge before this period because there were no egos before this period" (p. 184). Joseph Campbell observed that the principle "represented by the freely willing, historically effective hero not only gained but held the field and has retained it to the present. Moreover, this victory of the principle of free will, together with its moral corollary of individual responsibility, establishes the first distinguishing characteristic of specifically Occidental myth" (p. 24). </p>

<p>A distinction between the mythic-magical qualities of primitive thought and the mythic nature of all thought should be emphasized here. While thought in the <em>Mythic Epoch</em> was more advanced than the "primary process thinking" of earlier eras, the logical qualities that allow one's assumptions to be tested through deductive reasoning had not yet been developed. Thus for the primitive, all experience had to be interpreted in terms of the dominating myth; the culture's mythology created the lived reality. The cognitive abilities required to challenge its appropriateness had not been developed. </p>

<p>As consciousness evolved, however, so did the ability to reflect, to step out of the myth and consider the way the myth structures experience. While stepping out of a particular myth is neither easy nor instinctive, the capacity to do so marks the birth of psychological freedom. This monumental and far-reaching development, which led to the evolution of modern science, makes it conceivable that a people can speed the process by which they free themselves from the inadequacies of their mythic inheritance, a particularly critical matter in a rapidly changing world. </p>

<p>Piaget's stage of "formal operational thought," which develops during adolescence, is parallel to the type of thinking that emerged in the Rational Epoch. With the advent oft his period both in psychological development and in the historical epoch, reasoning about reasoning became possible. The mind becomes capable of turning back upon itself and reflecting on what it perceives. With the maturation of the ego, self-awareness reached the point that individuals were capable of making decisions with some measure of objectivity. The four stages of cognitive development portrayed to this point have a pyramidal relationship to one another. Advanced cultural and personal myths rest upon earlier myths that came to terms with the life of the body and the separation of self from the environment. The essential tenets of each subsequent stage must be integrated into previous stages and each emerging stage may disrupt mythic explanations worked out in earlier stages. </p>

<h2>THE DAWNING ERA OF A POST-CARTESIAN MYTHOLOGY</h2>

<p>Unlike the pre-Cartesian mythologies of earlier periods, the Western individual's identity was not founded upon the schism produced by the Cartesian mind-body split that came to dominate Newtonian thought (Berman, 1984). The functions once served by classical mythology were neglected and belittled as instinct was devalued in favor of rationality and community was devalued in favor of individualism. The inability of the newly emergent ego to integrate its activities with the prior realms of instinct, emotion and "body-self" is, in Wilber's eyes, the culture's essential dilemma. He points out that "Even [Erich] Neumann, arch-champion of the Hero Myth, dearly recognized that the clearly thrust went way too far and 'with this, the great reevaluation of the feminine begins, its conversion into the negative, thereafter carried to extremes in the patriarchal religions of the West"' (Wilber, 1981 p.189). </p>

<p>Preoccupation with the self as an entity separate from both body and reference group, necessary for the development of rational thought and individuality, became exaggerated. These separations, which were painstakingly achieved, are not easily transcended. The conquering hero of the contemporary era has ripped himself away from Mother Nature, spearheaded by a belligerent personal ego and supported by increasingly sophisticated technology. Wilber explains the dilemma in terms of the relationship of humanity to its biological nature, the mythical "Great Mother": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ego, in the necessary course of its emergence, had to break free of the Great Mother or biological nature embeddedness. That is all well and good-the ego, in fact, did manage to break free of its attachment and subservience and establish itself as an independent, wilful and constellated center of consciousness, a feat represented in the Hero Myths. But in its zeal to assert its independence, it not 'only transcended the Great Mother, which was desirable; it repressed the Great Mother, which was disastrous. And there the ego - the Western ego - demonstrated not just an awakened assertiveness, but a blind arrogance... no longer harmony with the Heavens... but a technological assault on Nature. It is one thing to gain a freedom from the fluctuations of nature, emotions, instincts and environment - it is quite another to alienate them. (pp. 187-188)</p>

<p>The personal costs of this emphasis on individuality have been tallied in terms of anxiety, uncertainty and a lack of rootedness, commitment and community. The forces of history, however, seem to be pushing toward an integration of the dualism, toward an era of what might be termed a "post Cartesian mythology," where the individual ego and the primordial nature from which it emerged will be re-united at a higher level of integration. Such holistic thinking involved the "dialectical operations" that Riegel has proposed as the final stage of cognitive development, following Piaget's "formal operation thought". </p>

<p>New guiding myths that transcend the emphasis on individualism which characterized the present era are unfolding. Moving from the prerational, pre-personal, pre-Cartesian myths of Wilber's Mythic Epoch and past the self-centered, Cartesian thought structures of the Rational Epoch, the myths that are now beginning to appear possess a distinctly post-Cartesian or post-personal or trans-personal character. That is, while individuality remains a prominent feature in these guiding myths, they reincorporate community values which transcend the personal ego and they achieve a re-attunement with nature and the life of the spirit. Sampson has emphasized the distinction between a one-sided self-contained individualism and an ensembled individualism that completes the circle by promoting community values. </p>

<p>The influences forging such a post-personal mythology range from our discontented isolation as individual egos to the stringent demands of the global crisis. Wilber believes that we can identify people who are already living according to the mythology of the coming era. He emphasizes that he described the first four epochs in the evolution of consciousness in terms of the average person's experiences and level of awareness. But he also notes that there are individuals whose lives reflect "the growing tip of human consciousness," the most advanced level of their time. The individuality that has become widespread in our culture was first restricted to sanctioned leaders. Wilber speaks of the first ones to live out the next major structure of consciousness as the shamans, the sages, and the saints who serve as prototypes of the advancing higher levels of consciousness. If Wilber is correct, then the self-actualizing subjects studied by Abraham Maslow may be examples of what is to come. They tended to evidence greater creativity, autonomy and ability to resolve polarities than their fellows, had more democratic (as contrasted with authoritarian) character structures and were more able to transcend thee go boundaries of a narrow sense of self. In addition,, certain universal values, such as truth, beauty and justice were stronger in their personal motivational schemes. </p>

<p>Such qualities may prove to be vital features of the expanded mythic visions we are collectively challenged to pursue. Rollo May (in press) believes that three new myths are necessary for our survival: the <em>"green myth"</em>, which would show our proper relation with nature; <em>women's liberation</em>, which would insure the rights and draw upon the talents of all people; and <em>planetism</em>, which would show the world as a place that transcends political boundaries. All three of these themes can be seen as correctives pushing to change the direction of the contemporary hero's journey. </p>

<p>The emphasis of our work has been on developing a system that teaches people to turn inward and bring greater awareness to the submerged mythology that lives through their thoughts, feelings and behavior (Feinstein and <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Krippner</a> 1988). In the process, individuals increase their capacity to stretch their personal myths beyond the limitations of their culture's mythology and beyond confining beliefs and images that are rooted in their unique history. Gaining a measure of autonomy from the limiting images of culture and other early influences increases one's sense of psychological freedom and strengthens one's ability to cope within a rapidly changing world. Because personal and cultural myths evolve in tandem, beginning to understand the mythic processes that operate within their own psyches also strengthens in people the capacity to more mindfully and effectively participate in the inescapable collective mythological changes that are shaping the future of their world.</p>

  <li>How to begin with the Present Situation</li>

  <li>How to Approach Authorities</li>

  <li>The Larger Goal</li>

  <li>The Nature of the Terrorist</li>

  <li>The Nature of the Victim</li>

  <li>How to Bring it all Together</li>

</ol>

<h2>I. How to Begin with the Present Situation (Grief, Anger, Retaliation)</h2>

<p>Any dispute or attack may be painful and difficult, but also an opportunity for your community to become a more enriching place for all. It is a chance for you to become a more whole person. Let this problem be an opportunity to realize that conflict is a central, unsolved issue in all cultures. </p>

<p>Whether you must deal with conflict in yourself alone, with others, or face professional dispute work with participants in extreme states of consciousness, remember that any discussion or expressions of feelings about past pain and injury are not only due to past events; they are experiences people have in the present. Now, we are hurting, now we may be retaliating at ourselves or others. Remember that it takes time to grieve and to feel sadness. Thoughts of revenge can be an edge to feeling pain, just as depression can be an edge to anger. </p>

<p>Whatever happens, remember your long time dream of a good life for all, keep this global view while dealing with any given momentary situation. Recognize that anyone who is angry — including yourself— is potentially dangerous. Tread gently. Be careful and don’t forget the outer aggressors are always a mirror image of what you might possibly look like, either now or at another point in your life. </p>

<p>The situation outside is not new; your whole life has been filled with ‘terrorist attacks’ against you, and attacks you have leveled at others. Learn collaboration insights and make processing conflict a habit from now on. </p>

<p>If possible, find the most insightful leader within yourself who is a martial artist, someone who will use her full awareness to follow and not repress issues so that they become terrorist attacks. This is an ‘inner’ someone who can feel all sides; yet not be in conflict herself with herself. </p>

<p>Before going to step II, recall that the world is both inner and outer work. Remember a time when you were repressed by someone and felt pushed into the role of the angry terrorist as a result. Also, please recall how you have done the same to others, how you repressed or would not hear them, and how —as a result —they became upset with you. If you can recall instances in which you became a ‘terrorist’ and caused others to be terrorists, you are prepared for the next step. If you cannot recall such instances, anything you do will not be based upon solid footing, and is less likely to be helpful. </p>

<h2>How to Approach ‘Authorities’</h2>

<p>Remember you are an authority simply because you consciously went through the previous experiences, a-f. Others may not realize that when they discuss the world situation, they are talking about themselves. </p>

<p>Outer people in authority—such as city and world ‘leaders’— may not have had any awareness training. Tell them in a heartfelt manner that what we’re going to do is both elegant and insightful, both rapid and sustainable—but it will include sensing more than their momentary feelings. The feeling skill to use with people in authority which works best is an appreciation for their dilemma. They’re caught in the crossfire of public life. They must satisfy both those who want revenge and those interested in love. </p>

<p>Whatever you suggest, insist that it is only an addition to what they are already planning, not as a reversal or overthrow of their methods. Remember, mainstream thinking is the way you think when you react without much awareness. So have compassion in all that you do. Now let’s go to the next step. </p>

<h2>III. The Larger Goal</h2>

<p>Deep in your heart, deep in the quietness of the night, your grandest visions include hope for the future of humanity and the planet earth. Formulate those grand visions now. After thinking of these visions, consider how you can model them in all that you do. Imagine right now using your vision, and see yourself modeling it. A vision works only with a model. </p>

<p>If necessary, amplify your vision with the following ‘addition.’ Nature moves us; our job is to make these movements conscious and useful. Dreams and emotions, love and anger happen. Our job is to guide these feelings so that they enrich our own and everybody else’s life, the life of all sentient beings. This ‘addition’ to your vision implies that life itself is a sacred event, even though it sometimes seems impossible. Life is not just a problem, but a kind of spiritual fighting ring, a temple requiring your utmost ability and wisdom. Nothing less than the grandest part of you is needed in an ultimate situation. The present moment is an opportunity, not only a threatening catastrophe. With this view, we can now go to the next step.</p>

<h2>IV. The Nature of the ‘Terrorist’</h2>

<p>The biggest problem for most of us will be to comprehend the nature of the energy and motivations of the terrorist. When you or I or anyone else becomes an angry terrorist wanting to hurt or retaliate without feeling for those who are being hurt, we are revealing something all of us human beings have experienced at one time or another. The point is that the terrorist is not unknown to you. She or he is who you become in injured states of consciousness. </p>

<p>A central aspect of the terrorist is the ‘freedom fighter,’ someone who wants a newer, better, and just world for herself and her own. Another aspect of the terrorist is the spiritual seeker who has found a goal that is greater than life itself, something that makes even her own life, or its sacrifice, insignificant. That is why threats of imprisonment or counter attack, never deter terrorists. Still another aspect of terrorism is terror itself. The terrorist has transformed fear into fury. Fear, terror, and anger are very close. Terror is often due to the fear of being hurt by an omnipotent aggressor. Anger comes from the sweet feeling of revenge mixed with the ecstatic power of aggression, which feels to the aggressor as the opposite to victimhood. </p>

<p>In a way, the terrorist has inadvertently become a mirror image of the thing she or he hates the most. She or he is a product of hopelessness, created in part by everybody else’s misunderstanding of who she or he is and what she or he stands for. Now let’s go to the next step. </p>

<h2>V. The Nature of the ‘Victim’</h2>

<p>The ‘victim’ (or in the case of Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the U.S, the one with more overt political, social or military power) is the ‘aggressor’ in the mind of the terrorist. The ‘victim’ is the ‘innocent’ one who has been attacked, and who identifies as being a victim. Now what we are going to say must be understood with compassion. The victim is the one who uses and remains in her victimhood to ease the guilt of being unconscious of her role in creating or at least collaborating in creating terrorism. The victim is in one way, partly responsible for the attack. She did not notice, she ignored or was unwilling or unable to face the terrorist, to hear her unhappiness, even when the signals of discontent were still mild or at least moderate and non destructive. </p>

<p>Consistent ignoring, repressing, dominating, and feeling you are better than someone else creates a false sense of peace, then come more rules, laws, police, military, and finally more war. This is not a criticism of the so-called victim, it’s really a compassionate embracing and understanding of unconsciousness followed by a supportive nudge to wake up. Nothing ever happens out of the clear blue sky. The clouds were thick for days, months, decades, and in some cases centuries while everyone pretended it was a sunny day. </p>

<p>Insights about the roles of the terrorist and victim can usually occur only with hindsight. In dealing with a victim (or a terrorist), we need at first to accept that she identifies herself as the innocent bystander. Then we must be ready to understand the victim’s deadly intent; retaliate and destroy the terrorist. Only after having had compassion with this one-sidedness, can we go to the next step. It is our experience that as long as you feel spiritually superior to the ‘victim’s’ (or the terrorist’s) aggressiveness, you should not try to help. Instead, realize that you too need help. You too are waging a kind of war and add to, but do not solve the problem. When you are ready, please go to the next step. </p>

<h2>VI. How to Bring It All Together</h2>

<p>If you’re not able to directly influence the military or negotiate at the peace tables, be a mayor or a president, you can still speak up in your group, your house of worship, on email, in local papers and with your neighbor next door. Know that war is everywhere, not just on a given battlefield. Terror is anytime you think about it. Your inner and outer work are all forms of ‘Worldwork’ touching a global field which influences a few or many individuals not only directly, but everyone indirectly through the quantum waves of non-locality. </p>

<p>After finding your inward center, a source of quietness in the midst of movement, try the following. Using your knowledge of the terrorist and victim, speak for, feel for, and act out each side, one at a time. If you do it alone, it’s inner work. When done with others, this is group work. Do it on TV. It’s Worldwork. As the terrorist, speak of your hatred, speak of history. Speak of the things you stand for which are more important than your personal life. Don’t just act or play this out. This is not only roleplay. Let it be authentic, a deep and penetrating dance moving your body. Be a shaman and experience shape shifting into the nature of the forces of this universe. Feel the terrorist’s body and notice how the words coming from her/his mouth come from the marrow of your bones. Go deeply and way beyond anything you’ve ever done before. Use your awareness and let your feelings go to infinity. When this feels done, switch sides. </p>

<p>Speak as the tortured ‘victim.’ Vehemently warn about your imminent retaliation. Describe all the personal and social privileges you know about, speak of your desire for peaceful, quiet, and loving relationships. Now go deeper. If you’re playing the US, get to the essence of New York. Not just the empire state building, but the lantern held proudly by that democratic spirit called the Statue of Liberty. Remember yourself as a dream of that home, an open door for those who have been oppressed. After admitting that you have not always been able to live that dream, remember your grandest vision and striving for democracy. Look into the roots of your heart and speak for 250 million people about the glimmer of hope that holds them together, a filament of light making them sometimes an unconscious monster but potentially an open heart, ready to accept anything, even those who have attacked her. If you could say this with honesty, to yourself, to others, to the papers and the TV, you have gone beyond the USA to the roots of democracy. Now it is time to go on. </p>

<p>If you do this with others, amazing and unpredictable things may happen among participants. Carry on this conversation for a maximum of two hours, then let go and say goodbye to all the spirits on your inner or outer stages. Go home and think it over. As many things happen in silence as they do in public. There is much more to do. There’s a song to be sung about freedom and life, a dance and theater needing to recapitulate the essence of this world drama and the dream like realities unfolding before our amazed eyes. There are more dreams to dream on, the future to work with. Thank you for trying. We recognize this is too general to be used as such, but hopefully broad enough to inspire your engagement. ✡ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>I'm going through the tedious, but fascinating process of transferring all my dream Journals onto computer disks so that I can more conveniently study my dream symbology. In doing so, I was struck by the number of times my dreams contain reference to shoes. Here's one of the dreams that caught my attention by its simplicity: </p>

<p>I'm polishing my shoes. </p>

<p>This dream occurred on the eve of a new semester of teaching. It clearly reflects a preparation process, getting ready, getting my act cleaned up, trying to look good. I rarely polish my shoes except for special occasions. The start of a semester was a special occasion. There are many special occasions for which I do not polish my shoes—rubbing them against the back of my pants as I head out the door is often sufficient. For me, polished shoes are a minor detail—say, compared to having my shirt ironed—but one I have learned that may subliminally affect other people's perceptions of me. If the occasion calls for impeccability, then perhaps the shoes should be shined—a perfectionistic ritual. </p>

<p>I can think of another occasion that called for perfectionism—ROTC inspection! For that I would have to also polish my brass buttons and brass belt buckle, not to mention my shoes shined with spit. ROTC is a long distant memory. It makes me realize, however, that on many occasions since that time, I'll shine any jewelry that I may wear, especially silver or copper, because of its corrosibility, but I still won't shine my shoes, just dust them off a bit. What does it mean then to shine my SHOES? </p>

<p>What are shoes? They provide comfort and support for my feet. What are my feet? They are what I walk with, what I use to contact the ground. Depending upon the type of ground I am going to walk on and the way in which I want to walk on that ground, I choose an appropriate pair of shoes. I have many to choose from: sneakers, moccasins, sandals, slip-ons, lace-ups and boots; and they may be casual, formal or just plain comfy. Shoes seem to be an interface between feet and ground that can take into account my intentions and desires and the conditions I'll encounter. </p>

<p>I can pick a pair of shoes that will match the occasion, and that feels good. I've also known the pleasure, like David Letterman, of being dressed up except for my sneakers—it does provide a bit of rebellious pleasure as well as compensatory relief from the constrictions of a closed collar and tie. On the other hand, In my dreams I've found myself in a situation with inadequate shoes, like walking in snow while wearing sandals, a trying experience! </p>

<p>Having the right pair of shoes on makes you feel just right, and having the wrong pair on can ruin your pleasure and make you feel "off". So what are shoes? </p>

<p>Somehow, metaphors and figures of speech involving shoes may provide a clue to the meaning of shoes. "If the shoe fits, wear it". Why not say, "If the shirt fits, wear it"? We say that a person who is financially well off Is "well heeled", meaning the person can absorb a lot of scrapes and scuffing without the wear showing. "Walk a mile in the other person's moccasins". "If you were in my shoes..." "Nothing fits like an old pair of shoes". Do you know of others? </p>

<p>I'd like to suggest an experiment. I would like to invite readers to submit their dreams that contain images of shoes, different types of shoes, being without shoes when that is an issue in the dream. I would also like you to submit as many figures of speech that involve footwear as you can think of or find other cultural expressions involving shoes. Write me a few lines about what you think shoes mean. </p>

<p>I'll collate the material you send in, add all my own shoe dreams, and see what I can come up with. With Bob's help, perhaps we can do some content analysis the dreams with shoe imagery and see if they differ from dreams with imagery of other types of apparel. What other kinds of analyses might you suggest? If you respond soon enough, I can publish the results in the issue after next. If this collaborative process seems to work, then after shoes, we can go on to shirts and skirts, and then to automobiles. I suspect that tires may relate to shoes. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-1.jpg" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto" alt="Montague Ullman"/></p>

<p>Five simple words, "if this were my dream" make the Ullman (1996, 1999; Ullman &amp; Zimmerman, 1979) process of Dream Appreciation one of the most profound instruments I have found to unlock the messages in dreams - and more. I had the privilege of participating in three dreamwork trainings with <a href="../@montagueullman">Monte Ullman</a> in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Ullman began his career as a psychiatrist but soon discovered the power of working with dreams and dedicated his life to teaching a method that allows the dreamer, as well as dream group participants, to access the deepest recesses of the unconscious. He believes that there is a species consciousness that is calling for our personal and collective survival and drawing us toward our ongoing evolution. Each of us, according to Ullman's philosophy, contain billions of single-celled organisms that have formed collectives of organs, systems, and functions, as they are learning to live as one, and as species, we are several billions of people also learning to live as one. Just as the human being cannot survive if cells become self-destructive or attack other life giving cells within the body, the species cannot survive if we, as individuals or as social groups, destroy others or ourselves with destructive patterns. </p>

<p>I interpret this to mean that for us to survive, cells and human beings must learn to respect life both individually and collectively. We must honor boundaries without creating impermeable walls, be distinct without separating, connect without absorbing or being absorbed, and be flexible without collapsing as we change and grow. We must actively share, nurture, love, and allow each and all to survive and thrive. However, in our development, as individuals and in social units, we have formed patterns that are a danger to ourselves and to our species. Ullman suggests species consciousness, perhaps something akin to Jung's collective unconscious, is the universal force that seeks to bring into awareness those behavior patterns that can lead to destruction. Dreaming is one of the languages of that universal consciousness. Dr. Ullman and Zimmerman (1979) contend that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The dreamer in us keeps urging us on to greater wholeness... Dreams never give up on us. They are with us every night urging us to face the issues that restrict and discourage us, or that limit our inventiveness. (Pp. 318-319)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>Appreciating Dreams</em>, Ullman (1996) states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>From an evolutionary point of view, there may be another role that our biology plays in connection with our dreams. I think dreamwork brings us into closer touch with a vital aspect of our natural animal heritage.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Animals depend for survival on the accuracy and truthfulness of their sensorially perceived world. That dependency is still with us in our effort to adapt to a still imperfect human environment. The task is a bit more difficult for us because of the pitfalls and falsehoods that our cultural heritage has subjected us to. To the extent that we are victimized by false notions, we are not free to truly fulfill ourselves. Asleep and dreaming. we are in pursuit of freedom in those areas that have eluded us while awake. The relationship between freedom and truth is the driving force of our dreams. (p. 243)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Picture, if you will, a group of people coming together who are interested in understanding their dreams. It is possible that no-one has met anyone else in the group and yet, by the end of a process, it is likely they will feel as if they have known each other their whole lives. In that time someone or maybe several of the members will have shared with the group a dream. There will have been careful listening, questioning, and each will have had the opportunity to take the dream that is presented as if it were their own. Feelings and metaphors within the dream will have been explored, and meanings orchestrated. There will be a bond that connects the participants through space and time, simply because they dared to look into the darkness, step into it, and discover what is there for them.</p>

<p>Group work, which often makes intimate matters public, is important according to Ullman (1979, 1996, 1999), because it allows the dreamer to use the eyes of the group to see aspects of the self that have been hidden. The waking self often is self-deceptive. To be effective, the group must provide a nonjudgmental, loving environment for the dreamer to expose those intimate matters and safely explore them. The dreamer must remain in charge of the process and be able to stop, limit sharing, or go only as deeply as can be handled. Both the dreamer and the participants have the opportunity to use the dream to discover messages from species-level consciousness and apply them to their own lives. And it all begins when each is willing to say: "If this were my dream."</p>

<h2>The Steps in the Process</h2>

<p>In Ullman's (1979, 1996, 1999) plan, there is no expert interpreter in dream appreciation. Instead the rich collective life-experience of the members provides an array of multiple levels and diverse viewpoints for many possible interpretations. A group learns the process from one who has been trained in the method; the teacher-leader then takes a place in the group as a participant. Dream presentation is always voluntary and after appropriate training, leadership is voluntary also. Each session is begun by soliciting a volunteer for leadership, with those volunteering deciding who will lead. When the leader is selected, the leader asks if there are any persons wanting to present a dream. The ones who wish to present a dream also decide among themselves who will be the dream presenter in that session. Determining leadership and dream presentation are models of volunteerism, democracy, and ongoing choice, all characteristics inherent in the dream process itself. The dream can be a single image or an entire story; processing can take two or more hours.</p>

<p>In the first stage the dreamer (a) reads or tells the dream while group members write it down, or read along. Upon completion, (b) the group members are free to question about the dream content for clarification. The dreamer is not to contextualize or interpret meanings at this point but is to reflect images, interactions, and feelings within the dream only. By allowing only dream content, participants are able more easily to take the dream into their own personal contexts.</p>

<p>The second stage begins with the first group member who says, "if this were my dream, I would feel..." which signals participants to take on the dream as if they had dreamed it. This is done by sharing their own feelings and when this feels complete, then sharing their thoughts about images and metaphors that they find in the dream content. The diversity of contributions offers many possible interpretations for the I dreamer to consider as he or she explores the potential hidden messages.</p>

<p>In the third stage part (a) the dreamer takes back the dream and may respond to anything that came into awareness as a result of hearing others' comments. This is followed by part (b) in which the dreamer, if open to investigate further, can gain greater meaning by recapturing the events that occurred or the thoughts that were present in waking life prior to the dream. After every aspect and symbol of the dream has been examined for possible meanings in the context of the dreamer's life, part (c) allows the dream to be read back to the dreamer, scene by scene, stopping for any additional insight when appropriate. Group members are then asked to offer what Ullman calls part (d) of stage three which is orchestrating projections to suggest meaningful interpretations of the dream as a whole that link the dream and the waking-reality of the dreamer. Finally, in part (e) the dreamer is given the opportunity to make any last comments.</p>

<p>If the group meets again, the next session begins with giving the dreamer in the previous dream group an opportunity to present any additional insights regarding the dream in the intervening period.</p>

<h2>The responsibilities</h2>

<p>Forming, leading, presenting, and participating in a dream group requires attention to a number of responsibilities if integrity is to be maintained. Above all else, the dreamer is to be in control of the process, deciding how deep to go, how much to disclose, and whether or not to advance into each stage. If for any reason at any time in the process the sense of safety feels threatened, the dreamer can stop the process and after expressing the need to stop, can choose to continue or end the process. Recognizing the tension that might exist between safety and discovery, the group and group leader can encourage stretching just a bit beyond the comfort level if the dreamer is willing. Always. a high degree of sensitivity is required to nudge without pushing too hard or too far. It is often in the thoughtful nudge that great insight occurs while a thoughtless push can devastate the dreamer and destroy the process.</p>

<p>The leader has dual roles. One is to be a participant; the other is to take responsibility for directing the process according to the stages. This must be done with clarity, flow, and flexibility in a way that honors the needs of the dreamer and the delicacy, yet, power of the process. The leader is to be sensitive to the feelings of both the dreamer and group members. At times it may be necessary to stop the process to clarify or give the dreamer or an affected participant time to recover from emotional responses. All of this must be allowed to flow gracefully within whatever time has been allotted for the work.</p>

<p>Group participants have responsibilities as well. They contribute most meaningfully and gain from the process themselves when they are fully present, when they listen with attention, and intend to experience the dream in thought and feeling. Through "borrowing the dream," the participant is free to make projections based on what is publicly known about the dreamer, or with the dreamer's permission if privately known, or based on memories from the participant's own life without taking the focus away from the dreamer. Participants can be attentive to possible themes, contradictions, or metaphoric meanings, and notice not only what seems present but also what seems absent. It is valuable to notice places that seem to have a charge. All of this must be done without judgment and with sensitive concern for the safety of the dreamer.</p>

<p>Finally, every aspect of the dream itself must be honored as significant communication from the unconscious. A single image, a two-liner, or a multi-phased dream contains a message that was important enough for the dreaming part of the self connected to species consciousness to send. It deserves to be respected and heard.</p>

<h2>The power of the process</h2>

<p>In the five years I have participated in Dr. Ullman's dream group process at Saybrook with <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a> and with Dr. Ullman, himself, I have come to deeply respect the potential for transformational healing and self-discovery. In those years of dreamwork, dreamers and participants have been able to face their demons, discover their blind spots, find answers to troubling dilemmas, and understand circumstances in their lives that previously may have seemed unexplainable. The persistence of "species consciousness" seeming to push messages into awareness in spite of individual or group resistance is amazing.</p>

<p>My interest in discovering connections among things caused me to notice that often in dream groups, questions that were raised in the content of the first dream seemed to be answered by the second, and understanding the second dream was made possible within the context of the first. I also noticed this same process going on between dream groups in which I was the only repeat participant. Thematic connections not only clarified dreams in the later group but brought deeper insights into a past dream group's theme. Whatever this "energetic connective tissue" is that flows between cells forming a single person, seems to flow between individuals forming a palpable energetic relationship that exists in groups and between groups. Perhaps species consciousness is somehow in this as yet unexplainable connectivity that makes itself known when we are willing to look for it.</p>

<p>The dissolution of boundaries between dreams and dream group experiences also drew my attention. I recall being greatly surprised the first time I realized that a dream was literally but unconsciously being replicated in the group process. A woman presented a dream in which she experienced herself walking along a busy thoroughfare pulling a cart filled with a heavy load. She forced her way ahead of every one else and created a traffic jam by stopping in the middle of an intersection. The dreamer held her fist in defiance to the blocked angry drivers who began throwing things at her while she was calling attention to the fact that she did not have a car, but rather was pulling her load without help. She woke feeling distressed and unappreciated.</p>

<p>In the dream group, she pressed ahead of other dreamers to insist that she have the opportunity to present her dream. Others who wanted to present their dreams gave in to her almost demanding request, but not without creating a current of anger and resistance within the group. They did not seem to support her with full engagement in the process. Instead they threw out suggestions of interpretations that did not seem useful to her. She found herself dealing with the content of her dream by herself. She continued by making her own interpretations about the meaning of her dream within the context of her recent experiences without incorporating anything that the group had offered. In a moment of profound insight, she became silent, looked around the room, and broke into tears. She realized she had done the same thing in the group that she had done in her dream. She could see that her attitude was what had generated the anger and the lack of support both in her dream and in that moment. For the first time in her life, she understood long held patterns that caused her to believe she had to carry her burdens all by herself. Her breakthrough melted her resistance and the heart of the group. Everyone became willing to help her when she finally got out of her own way by getting out of their way and allowed them to be moved to support her in her breakthrough. What a powerful metaphor!</p>

<p>When I decided to write this paper, I could have selected any number of dreams, but this particular one came to mind and I literally could not remember any of the other dreams I had worked with over the years. By recalling this dream, several years after it was presented, I began to see something I was not in a place to understand at the time that I attended that dream group. I have had a strong, almost rigid tendency to carry my burdens all by myself, always working without a sense of connection to a group. I lived most of my life, within my family of origin and within my marriage, alone. I moved to China alone; my private therapy practice is conducted alone. Even my selection of an at-a-distance program for my Ph.D. is a reflection of my living the metaphor within the woman's dream. Most of my courses I completed without ever asking assistance from professors. This created conflict with a couple of them that delayed receiving credit for my work. As I look at this pattern, I notice that working alone seems to have been choiceless. Some inner belief made me do everything alone. There have been times when working alone has been helpful, and there still may be such times in the future, but there are also times when I need to be able to work cooperatively within a group. Working in isolation may not have been damaging in the past, though I can't really know that. I do know that it is no longer good for me to disallow other options. Now that I am beginning my dissertation, I can see that a rigid, loner-stance would not only be a liability, it could block my reaching the goal.</p>

<p>It is my belief that recalling and using this particular dream at this particular time is no accident. I deeply feel that a loving consciousness has called me to release patterns that would prevent me from becoming who I came here to be. I am being drawn to a new way, connecting and working with others. Somehow, I believe that as changes are made by each of us on a microcosmic level, resonating sounds of doors opening somewhere out there in the universe are heard that might lead to macrocosmic changes for the species.</p>

<p>Probably the most far-reaching aspect of having "dream group awareness" was when I discovered the dream process can be applied to life experience. I became aware that events in people's waking lives had many of the same characteristics as dreams. When taking notes on clients' "stories," I discovered I could pay attention to all the details with the same attention I held as a participant in a dream group. I examined the setting the client reported, looked for themes, noticed tensions and observed contradictions. I looked for metaphoric potential. I looked for what seemed missing, perhaps emotional responses or pieces that didn't seem to connect because something was left out. I listened for a sense of story, a belief or myth that might be playing itself out in the person's life. I noticed the play on words that were embedded in the telling of the story. I even noticed each of the people the client talked about and began to look for aspects of the client that seemed to be reflected in the characters who "peopled" their report. I could take the stories into my life, and experience them as if they were my own, and notice my own responses. I approached the client's story with the same kind of non-judgmental, loving, respect, as in dreamwork. As I orchestrated projections, clients began to gain profound insight and make significant and immediate changes. I am reminded of a report told by Salk (1983), the developer of the polio vaccine.</p>

<p>He said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Very early in my life I would imagine myself in the position of the object in which I was interested. Later, when I became a scientist, I would picture myself as a virus, or as a cancer cell, for example, and try to sense what it would be like to be either. I would also imagine myself as the immune system, and I would try to reconstruct what I would do as an immune system engaged in combating a virus or cancer cell... Before long, this internal dialogue became second nature to me. (p. 7)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it is this consciousness that is entered in dream group work or in working with clients. Asking clients to look at an issue as if it were a dream and by joining them in the dream by taking it on as if it were mine, we step back to see what is really going on, looking for the myths and belief systems through which they create their lives. The clients recognizes that they have a choice regarding what myths direct their lives and whether or not they will take responsibility for that choice.</p>

<p>I have the choice of interpreting events in my life as a dream and all the participants in the events as characters who hold messages from the greater consciousness, just as I can fill that role in their lives should they choose. I can ask myself the same questions a leader or a participant would ask a dreamer and listen to possible orchestrating projections. More than any other method, the Ullman dream appreciation process has helped me to take responsibility for all that occurs in my life. I am learning to look at my life as I look at dreams, without judgment, blame, or guilt. I notice that on some level everything that comes into my life is a result of my personal myths whether I am consciously aware of them or not. I can choose to be responsible, meaning I can choose to respond. In making the choice of taking responsibility for what I create, I can also move to a place where I consciously create what I choose.</p>

<p>Playing on the words of an old favorite Disney song from "Cinderella," I would say A life is a dream your heart makes, when you are fast asleep. Awaken to the dream!</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It was September 22, 1991 and I arrived promptly at Dr. Glenn’s office for my Radix Bodywork session. I had no idea that the life I thought I had been living was about to crumble like so many pieces of stale bread. </p>

<p>In the course of my four year tenure with Drs. Linda and Austen Glenn, I began to experience a series of visions that disturbed and intrigued me. The images that revealed themselves to me had come flooding forth, unraveling in the most unexpected way. Each new insight brought its own unique cascade of terrifying emotions, but the nature of the work kept pulling me back. Not unlike peeling succeeding layers of skin from an onion, I set about the task of looking deep within my own psyche. Other trips I had made to my inner landscape had always been fruitful, but none had led me to the place I was about to go. </p>

<p>As I dragged my feet slowly up the red brick steps to Linda and Austen’s office in their suburban Conway home, I felt a deep sense of dread. I stopped for a moment on their front porch to take a deep breath as I remembered how painful my last session had been. I took a long look at the cascading ivy that tumbled off their porch and covered most of their lawn. I could smell the delicious fragrance of the thick white Gardenia blossoms that dotted the bushes next to their porch like so many clusters of perfume drenched clouds, drunk on their own elixir. I opened their front door, listening to the familiar creak of the hinges as Linda met me with open arms and a warm, inviting embrace. </p>

<p>As I lay on my green mat in the middle of the hardwood floor, a series of cartoon-like figures unraveled inside my head. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A tall, dark man appeared first, etched in red. Initially, he seemed to carry a red cane. I could scarcely breathe as I watched this walking stick turn into an erect penis, which he rubbed over the naked body of a little girl. Then the image folded up like a paper fan, transformed into a vertical black line in my field of vision. A little girl’s voice spoke out: “Bad boy! You were not supposed to come out.” Next, I saw the chubby fingers of a child’s right hand, holding a key. She reached over and locked the black line, as if it were a door.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the years to come, I would embark on an odyssey of epic proportions, leaving my body and soul wracked in agony. I would journey even further inward, back through time and space, even past the dark holes of my personal past, and finally arriving face to face with spiritual ecstasy. </p>

<p>This story is a tale of redemption and renewal, death and rebirth, and triumph over darkness. But most importantly, this is a love story. Alone and utterly forsaken, adrift on treacherous waters, I was joined by a celestial figure of light whose name is simply Grandfather. As a psychologist in practice for over 13 years when I began uncovering the secrets of my past, I was already well acquainted with much of the literature on childhood abuse. I knew that betrayal in the form of sexual abuse creates an opening —a sacred wound —through which the Divine may enter. It is no accident that abused children often have greater access to the world of the spirits; they have, after all, been penetrated. </p>

<p>I don’t know for sure when I first encountered the black ravens of despair, but I strongly suspect they have been with me all my life. I do remember, however, hearing them at the age of four when I traveled by train to St. Louis with my great aunt to see my grandparents. The ravens awoke when my grandmother said it was time for me to take a bath. When I realized that my grandmother and aunt planned to bathe me — naked — the haunting screams of the ravens reverberated inside my head. The flapping of their wings as they began to tear at my heart, sent me into a panic. No one, not even I, realized that the ravens had good reason to fear the vulnerability of a naked body. </p>

<p>Being the oldest of five children, I often spent long periods of time alone when I was very young, and I had a very rich and active relationship with an imaginary playmate named Jocko. I was emotionally troubled, always anxious and afraid, and I had a very difficult time making friends. </p>

<p>I remember my grandmother as my guardian angel. She actually paid attention to me and often intervened in my defense; I knew clearly that she was an answer to my prayers. No one else did that. The ravens went mad when she died. The clawing and tearing, the awful screaming inside my head, seemed endless. </p>

<p>I did have one secret that was all mine, something no one could take from me. I discovered a world full of brightly colored fantasy creatures with whom I carried on many lengthy conversations. And, best of all, Jocko lived here! I delighted in my ability to escape to this other world where I could leave behind all the emptiness and misery of my real one. Until - one day when I tried to talk to my parents about my friend Jocko and the world he inhabited. “Crazy,” they called me. “Evil,” they said. And I believed them. </p>

<p>By the time I started school, I suffered from nightmares, eating problems, and behavior problems. I found out years later when my father inexplicably handed me my childhood medical files, that I had been diagnosed as emotionally disturbed in grade school. And the doctor had discovered two outbreaks of vaginitis. The ravens were nowhere to be found. </p>

<p>After successfully battling major depression, a result of grief over my divorce in 1985, I found myself grappling with mysterious physical ailments. I sought medical advice from family doctors, chiropractors, and neurosurgeons. But no one could explain the unremitting insomnia, back pain, and chronic dis-ease and anxiety that plagued me. Psychotherapy and bodywork provided only minor relief. </p>

<p>Then the dreams began—strange images of a small hysterical child, hurling herself against the fiery red, burning walls of a pit, desperately wanting out of this “burning place”. And in 1988, there was this dream: A body of water stands surrounded by trees and flanked by mountains to the left. A large number of tribal chieftains march over the ridge of these mountains blowing their tribal horns. I am awe struck, thinking to myself within the dream state that this must be a very significant dream and one that I must share with my dream group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I watch myself walking on the water towards the base of the mountain. I now realize these tribal elders are calling me. I am dressed in a thin white gown as I climb up the side of the mountain where I discover a younger Indian man. I am now naked as we perform a ritual. White smoke billows all around us as he dances in a circle around me. It is okay that I am naked because he and I will never marry. The elders watch as the ceremony proceeds. The Indian man and I walk off arm in arm as we are now to be married.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On September 15, 1992 I began seeing a therapist named Anna. I knew very little about Anna except that she had an excellent reputation and that she was very interested in Buddhism. The day dawned bright and sunny as I dragged myself out of bed after another sleepless night. My heart felt heavy and the burning sensation in my stomach I had been living with for over a year, seemed worse than usual. How I managed to drag my listless body up those many steps to her office, I will never know. </p>

<p>With Anna’s help and encouragement, I began paying close attention to the visions that had begun resurfacing earlier that same year, during daily meditations. During this time, I frequently meditated for 3 to 4 hours at a time. I began to record everything in painstaking detail and the visionary process intensified over the next three years. By early 1993, a spirit by the name of Lady in White (LIW) began confronting me with some unexpected and frightening material.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>1/24/93:</strong> LIW stands off in the distance, on top of a purple mountain silhouetted against a celestial moon. She holds a tiny baby dressed in white garments and circles round a blazing fire, stopping at each of the four directions to elevate the child to the heavens. As she hands the infant to me, I notice a large amethyst crystal embedded in her forehead. “She has been called forth to do some important healing work on earth,” the Lady explains. “Everything is about to come together for her but her soul will feel as if it is being ripped and torn into many pieces.” LIW places her hand over the purple stone that is beginning to take shape on my own forehead</em></p>
  
  <p><em>“This is the mark we have given her. It is designed to provide an opening. She will be illuminated from within and without and she will know. She is meant to illuminate the earth, to shine light upon all she encounters. She must know the burning nature of this light.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>1/25/93</strong> LIW dances joyously on top of the purple mountain, arms outstretched to the sky. The brilliant moon stands as silent witness to her supplications as the stars wink in appreciation. The baby, ashen in color and barely breathing, lies prostrate on the ground in a coffin-like pit. The amethyst in her forehead barely flickers and her skin is bluish-gray. I am worried that she is close to death, but the Lady explains that she is just awaiting rebirth. I watch in horror as LIW dumps mounds of dirt on top of the baby. Thin blades of light stab at the air from beneath the soil and a roaring fire explodes from the slivers of light. The fire burns itself out, leaving the little pit looking whitewashed. The baby is nowhere in sight. A tiny amethyst stone is all that remains of her. A bolt of lightning crashes down from the heavens, striking the purple stone. A liquid begins to sizzle and bubble around the crystal. From this liquid, white smoke appears forming a solid cloud over the pit. The smoke clears to reveal a very small frozen infant.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<p>I was seeing Anna twice a week for individual sessions and meeting with my dream group weekly, while working with my analyst three times a year during four day retreats. Amazingly enough, I managed to maintain a successful private practice and continued to meditate daily. However, I found it almost impossible to socialize with people and found myself living a sort of hermit lifestyle. Other than going to work, taking care of household chores, and visiting with my family on special occasions, I rarely left my home. Most of my friends eventually drifted away. </p>

<p>The visions continued as I grew increasingly ambivalent about the intensifying connection I felt with Anna. Even though she was very good about letting me know how to get in touch with her whenever she was out of town, the closer I felt to her, the more frightened I became that she would abandon me. I remember calling her multiple times one day, first canceling all my appointments and then calling back to reschedule. I marveled at the patience and compassion she showed me during all the years I worked with her. I know now that I owe her my life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/7/93:</strong> As I stare into a blazing fire, I make out a dark face with golden eyes wavering in and out of the flames. Mesmerized, I continue to stare as the flames die down. A huge man wearing a long white robe with golden threads now stands before me, towering miles above the earth. In the encounters to come with this mysterious and compelling man, I would come to know him as the Master.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/8/93:</strong> The Master and I stare silently at each other through the flames of a roaring fire. His eyes are definitely golden and without pupils, with black lines etched across their surface, giving him the appearance of some wild, alien creature. Still he seems Oriental, with white hair, a white goatee, and thinning hair. When the fire dies down, his eyes flash beams of light that illuminate the darkness all around me. As if by magic, my body begins to levitate as a table appears, suspended in mid-air over the embers of the fire. The Master maneuvers my body onto this table, removes my clothing, and cuts me open from neck to groin. He reaches inside the cavity and pulls out a tiny crystal clock that reads close to midnight. “It is almost time for the soul work to begin, he says.” After examining my heart, he probes deep into my uterus and discovers a baby. As he touches her lovingly, a smoky white mist begins to materialize. The Master sighs with apparent pleasure and then breathes upon the little white cloud. It immediately shudders in response and bright lights dance through its transparent form. He closes up the opening in my body and I retire to the opposite side of the fire.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Silence descends upon us. I plead with him to tell me who he is. He paces back and forth, then sits back down. A large tear rolls out of his left eye. I reach over and gently wipe it away. “You do not recognize me yet, do you?” he says. “Not yet, Master, but you told me the last time we talked that Anna would know who you are. Is this true? Do you want me to ask her?” He says that I should talk with Anna, that he and Anna know each other very well. “How will she recognize you, Master?” As I look up at him, a brilliant blue, round light forms in front of his face. Then it changes to white, outlined in blue. The Master says: “Tell her about the blue light fading into white, so brilliant there is nothing else and she will know.” As he prepares to leave, I run up to him, calling out and addressing him as Grandfather. These words fly out of my mouth, as if uttered by someone else from some other place. He is as surprised as I am. “Is Grandfather right?” I ask. “Grandfather, I do know you. I do know you, Grandfather!” Both in tears, we embrace. When I open my eyes, he is gone. I catch a glimpse of him disappearing behind a golden door. The blue light reappears, and again fades away into white. And I hear these words: “Blue light fading away into white—so brilliant there is nothing.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>2/14/93:</strong> I am in a strange land. White curtains hang everywhere. The winds howl and the mists are on the rise. Voices echo all around me but I see no one. The curtains form a maze through which I cannot see my way clear. A very old man appears from within the billowing white fabric columns. He wears a long brocade gown similar to the Master’s, only weighted down by heavier ornamentation and golden threads. He has very long fingernails, long hair, and a long pointed beard. He looks Oriental like Grandfather — only much older. Both his hair and beard are pure white. His long jeweled fingers beckon me to follow him and he leads me into a lavishly decorated room, embellished with gold. An ornate, golden, glasstopped case sits high on a pedestal. As I get closer, I can tell it is a casket. There is a body inside. I am overtaken with grief as I recognize my beloved Grandfather!</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I crawl up on top of the casket, weeping and crying out to him. Miraculously, I find myself once again outside amidst the maze of white curtains. The winds continue to howl as the mists gather all around me. Voices echo everywhere; shadowy forms float past me. Grandfather’s golden visage appears in the sky, and he speaks to me. “This is the land of the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown, the land of reality and unreality, of death, rebirth and reincarnation. I will be with you always.” From underneath one of the curtains crawls a little boy, pulling a red-headed little girl in a white gown. A strange light surrounds them.</em></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>2/16/93</strong></p>

<p>I saw Anna yesterday and told her about my meditations, as Grandfather had asked. Anna wore an Oriental looking silk jacket, navy blue in color with brightly colored silk flowers embroidered onto the front. I kept my eyes locked onto that jacket as I was so afraid of her reaction. What if she told me I was out of my mind? or delusional? No sane person would admit to seeing ghosts now, would they? I held my breath and traced the toe of my foot around the design on her rug as I read the entry dated 2/8/93. When I finished with the passage, I looked up to see Anna smiling at me. She indicated that I should stop reading and then she just stared at me for what seemed like an eternity. I can still remember the loud ticking of the small mahogany clock on her desk as I waited for her response. Then she took a deep breath and told me that she indeed recognized Grandfather! “His name is Medicine Buddha,” she said. She pointed to the lapis lazuli ring she wears. “I wear this stone because of my relationship with him.” </p>

<p>Chills ran up and down my body as she spoke. As I left her office, my legs felt like rubber bands and I was overcome with emotion. My journey had begun. I felt totally confused, dazed and... strangely elated. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>What we're dealing with in dreamwork, in short, is counterconditioning. Constantly we're blasted by what's all around us with what we should think and feel. It's so easy to let a lot of our decisions be made by all that noise. Meanwhile we're being just as consistently informed from within by a different source. Our dreams tell us what we do think and what we do feel and what we do perceive. </p>

<p>Dreams, like little children, can't help but be truthful. They are the accurate map to our reality. The one we're being spoon fed day and night from external sources isn't so much wrong as it is outdated, like an ancient map with inaccurately depicted shorelines. </p>

<p>Why then is it so assiduously propounded by everything and everyone around us? Because it serves to maintain things as they are and we all profit more than we care to realize by keeping things just as they are. Not just those in economic or political power who are profiting at our expense. Not just those who grow rich as we grow fat or as others starve. Not just those who get powerful when we stay poor; or who get even richer when we try to get rich. Not just those who earn fat therapy fees when we stay confused about who we really are. Not just all of those. But we ourselves benefit from keeping everything the same. It is safe. Just look at the parts of the world today where change is breaking through to the surface - Poland, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Guatemala. Change always involves turmoil, a return to chaos before the new more inclusive order emerges. It's nothing other than the creative process that is at work. Anyone who has embarked on the path of creative personal transformation knows what I mean. True work with dreams often brings disruption and indecision and chaos before it heralds in the higher level of awareness that a lone enables a deeper, truer life. It's not nice to be miserable but it's a little more bearable if we don't know it. So we read about Poland and El Salvador in the newspapers and forget our dreams. If they persist in forcing themselves upon our awareness, then we manage to not understand them. It's easier. It allows us to stay as we are. </p>

<p>If, by working with dreams, we do manage to free ourselves from an intolerable domination like Cuba or Vietnam did, we congratulate ourselves, ignoring that we may have landed under a different but equally intolerable oppressor. The movement toward freedom tries to continue as in Poland but meets powerful resistance. The chaos it entails is too disruptive. It's easier to remain fixated somewhere along the way where we can congratulate ourselves on our progress while doing everything in our power to defeat the ongoing process. But the process won't stop. It will merely find someone else in whom it can carry itself forward. Most of society is composed of dead souls, washed up on the shore of their fixation to a stagnant life. History moves through the rare individuals: "I have a dream," Martin Luther King said. </p>

<p>Domination from any one super strong component of our total souls is intolerable. Total freedom is the only aim. Freedom from within. For each part of us to be free to be what it is. Not for some other part of us, however strong and valid and important, to tell it what it should be. The repressed part will always merely go underground, into our dreams, towage its guerrilla warfare. If the smallest segment of the whole circle is rejected, we don't have a circle anymore. The tiniest excluded part of us can easily sabotage the whole and cause all our good aims to go awry. An age old axiom goes, "As without, so also within." What are our souls like? Look at our world, our society, our environment, our bodies. Need I say more? </p>

<p>So we are polluted, we are dominated, we are ravaged, we are unreal, and hence, we are ineffectual in achieving what can really make our lives work. </p>

<p>These ideas aren't new. Everybody knows these things. Read any psychology book or New Age manifesto. But such knowledge hasn't helped us. Knowing with the mind is of little import. When we know in the real sense, the only sense that signifies, we become, we transform. D.H. Lawrence, poor misled man, was right all along when he talked of "knowing with the blood." Unfortunately though, it was all an intellectualization with him. The disease that his life was eventually overtook him, as it will us all. </p>

<p>There is a way out, though. You don't even have to work with your dreams but dreamwork makes it easier, much easier, for people like us. Krishnamurti maintains that when we become enlightened we cease dreaming. Reality itself becomes the dream that we write. Nothing is forced into the underground to wage its guerrilla fight toward our awareness. Everything that we are is admitted into our being. The battle is over. Freedom is won. Life itself becomes deeper and fuller and more beautiful than we could ever dream. I haven't reached that ultimate state. I have only tasted little glimpses but these have shown me that it is the only thing worth pursuing. </p>

<p>My work with dreams has shown me that our society is a lie. Our lives are lies. The things I have wanted aren't the things I want. The things I have needed aren't the things I need. What I was and am isn't what it is to be a human being. Working with dreams and with creativity (I am writing a novel that came from a dream) has carried me to the portal of a new way of being. I started the dream community of New York perhaps because I'd rather not be alone as I take the next few steps. </p>

<p>Armed with our dreams we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around. The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women. All the rest has been noise, an externalized reverberation from these great happenings. To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The secret of dream work is that you don't need dreams to do the kind of work we do on them. These same techniques, once mastered by long and diligent work with dreams, can be applied to waking life with radical results. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>Free association</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Lie down and get into a relaxed state. Let your mind wander along any one of its innumerable habitual channels of association. The important thing is to let go of all conscious control and direction. Let what arises arise, and then let it move on to the next thing spontaneously, automatically. But each time you become aware that you are in the middle of a thought, focus on it; not on the thought itself, which is as shopworn and stale as our conscious minds themselves, but on the images behind the thought. In the pictures our minds have collected, there is a vast reservoir of information that has never been adequately processed because our consciousness was too narrow and constricted at the time by conditioning to perceive the seemingly infinite dimensions of feeling tones present. When these pictures themselves, the images upon which our thoughts are based, are revisited in this way at a later time - especially after we have worked extensively with dreams- we bring to them the much wider dimensions of consciousness we have become capable of in the interim. We can enter directly into the consciousness of those who touched our lives long ago. We can revisit the consciousness of the person we were then. When we can do that, it becomes apparent that we are not the same person now. We feel and understand who we are in a transformed way. </p>

<p>The thoughts that meander incessantly through our minds are wrong. It's not that they are in error. But they are based upon an inadequate sampling of the original experience itself. The beauty of the human system is that this experience has been ingrained directly into our brains and bodies in the form of pictures and patterns of tension. It can be revisited by revisiting the pictures directly and its hidden wealth harvested long, long after the fact. The tensions can be released directly into spontaneous emotional expression. </p>

<h2>Dialogue</h2>

<p>We have at our fingertips not only this vast reservoir of our own experience but also the near infinite experience of all the people, places, and things that have ever touched our lives, even in the most marginal way at the time. These other characters and settings can be revisited directly in the form of the images they have left imprinted in our minds. For if they touched us at any little spot, they touched us with the whole of themselves. And the whole of their wisdom and insight as well as the depth of their sickness and pain - the two categories are not something different one from the other - is ours for the asking. "Ask and it will be given to you," the Bible says, "Seek and ye shall find." If we will take the time out from our daily and meaningless chatter with ourselves and with those around us, if we move to that protected place of peacefulness within us from where the images of our past can be viewed directly, we can strike up meaningful dialogue. Of course, we find with our minds what our hearts always knew. Of course, it may turn into tears. We let our body cry. We let our heart feel what we never let it feel before. And each time we do this, we take a burden off it. Ours becomes a healthier heart. We find that the dialogue and contact with those around us in our waking life then becomes more meaningful and true. </p>

<p>We don't have to wait for dreams to work with these things. What goes on when we're dreaming is going on all the time. Dreamwork is an invaluable training and a prerequisite for this kind of waking work with images. Too few dreamworkers realize this. They become fixated on dreamwork, like a grade school pupil who keeps flunking and never makes high school There is a step beyond this waking imagery work. You graduate from the graduate school of consciousness when you take these same processes into waking life itself, when you can work with and revision your daily episodes even as they are happening. </p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>You find that a radical reframing of a situation springs readily to mind even as it is happening. You see directly how the ways you are approaching an individual or a situation are habitual and invalid. You see others directly and nakedly for what they are behind the mask and the role they appear to be playing. You notice what's missing as well as what's happening. Of course, the analysis of a situation is the recognition and acceptance of your feelings in that situation. When you feel what you are fully, you can't help but accept it, and love it. You can quit trying to make it otherwise. This happens naturally. Like I said, the human organism is an amazing instrument. We need far less control than we imagine. These things happen naturally and spontaneously when we quit interfering with them. We have been conditioned to wander around in a false dream reality all day long, but it is in our nature- if only we would allow it - to awaken from this dream of false notions into a reality of deep involvement.</p>

<h2>...and so on and so forth</h2>

<p>The same holds true for all the other multitudinous techniques of working with dreams. </p>

<p>Dreamwork itself can become incidental to the expansion of awareness. Ultimately, only by letting go of dream resolutions and resolving our conflicts in waking life can we free our dreams for deeper purposes. Their deeper purpose is to always lead us further and further toward the shores of fuller awakefulness. Is there an end to this and thus an end to dreaming as enlightened ones like Krishnamurti suggest? I don't know, I doubt that I am anywhere near that point. For me, dreamwork can still be a powerful tool for growth. I've seen the process thwarted, however, in certain individuals who, for all their prowess in the world of dreams and imagination, are unable to translate the resolution of their conflicts to waking life and so, like a branch stuck between two rocks in a fast running mountain stream swishes back and forth repeatedly with the current, all their movement is getting them nowhere. </p>

<p>Yes, what I am saying is that dreamwork, like everything else, can be an escape from life. A woman I know who is afraid of sexual relationships with men has the most incredible sexual lucid dreams with orgasms and the whole bit. Her dream prowess is like the exceptional hearing developed in certain blind people - a compensation for a defect. She pursues her dream work rigorously and has made it a profession because it enables her to sidestep her defect. And consequently, it is also ruining her life. Needless to say, there is no telling her this. Our blind spots are our hurt spots. Who appreciates the doctor who would reopen the painfully infected wound? I'm not a therapist anyway and am not about to stick my fingers in her mind. If knowledge could heal, how whole we would all be! Only the full experience of the present waking situation heals. Dreams are an avenue, not a substitute. This is a secret that some of the dream therapies ignore and some of the greatest dream workers today only pay lip service to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Here is a dialog with Christa Mackinnon. Christa is author of SHAMANISM &amp; SPIRITUALITY IN THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE, An Introduction. She lives and works as a social psychologist and family counselor in Devon, in southwest England. I am honored to introduce Christa Mackinnon to DNJ readers.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>David Sparenberg:</strong> It is well known that wider interest in matters shamanic developed out of Mercia Eliade’s study, <em>Shamanism</em>. In that foundational text, Eliade provides two key designations of the shaman as “master of ecstasy” and “technician of the sacred.” Since the counterculture of the 1960’s, there has been an uninterrupted outpouring of books on the subject. My own favorite is <em>Shamanic Voices</em> by Joan Halifax, which includes first hand accounts by practicing shamans throughout the world. So there is an established subculture of shamanic seekers and practitioners. Within this context, what is shamanism for a professional therapist in Britain? What is your shamanism? Where do you place it in life and work? </p>

<p><strong>Christa Mackinnon</strong>: David, the moment I read your first question, I couldn’t help smiling. We are already ‘in the zone’. Your favorite book is ‘Shamanic Voices’ by Joan Halifax and the first shamanic teacher who crossed my path was a friend of Joan’s and had worked with her. </p>

<p>I also love Halifax’s book. When I read it I really began to appreciate the profound understanding of, and connection to, ‘All there is’, which traditional, indigenous shamans world-over exhibit; I also was quite taken by their incredible range of skills. They were/are not only ‘technicians of the sacred’, visionaries, seers, healers, spiritual leaders, masters of the ecstatic, communicators with natural forces and creatures, overall intermediaries between earth and spirit, they were/are also political leaders, ecologists, storytellers, artists, dancers and more.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-1.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Fire altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fire Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>I find this is one of the differences between shamanic subculture now and traditional, indigenous shamans. The subculture doesn’t produce people with such vast abilities, which is one reason I am reluctant to call myself a ‘shaman’. Many of us utilize parts of this wisdom heritage and develop, adjust or integrate it. We can lament about the fact that what we now encompass under the term ‘shamanism’ doesn’t always come close to the traditional and indigenous, but I feel that shamanism has survived for so long because it is timeless and can be adapted. Personally, it plays a big part in my work and my private life, which are scarcely distinguishable. It has done so for the last 18 years, when I begun to integrate it professionally. I run countless courses for therapeutic professionals on subjects such as journeying, soul-retrieval, ancestral work, ceremonies and so on, but also facilitate wilderness camps, trance-dance groups and vision quests. I even push for it to be explored within the more conventional field of therapy and medicine. Within my therapeutic professional work, I focus more on integrating the ‘psycho-spiritual’ aspects of shamanism. I still find it difficult to accept that the vast majority of psychologists and therapists in the UK &amp; EU reject shamanism; part of what I see myself called to do is to bring it into the conventional psychotherapeutic and medical community. It is interesting that the therapeutic community is waking up to the fact that we need to address spiritual aspects of the human being, but so far is afraid to take this further than integrating a bit of ‘mindfulness’ into otherwise mainly cognitive-behavioral orientated approaches. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Another well-known classification for the shaman, especially through medical authors such as Jeanne Achterberg and Larry Dossey, is that of “wounded healer.” But not everybody who is wounded spiritually, psychologically, emotionally or physically, has a healing response, although everybody may have the capacity. Not everyone wounded becomes a shaman. Personally, I think that passion and pathos are determinates. But do you find that there is a shamanic personality type? If so, what are some key traits? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> I think there is something quite significant in the idea of the ‘wounded healer’, especially the one who has healed herself. In traditional shamanism, as far as I understand it, the wounding often refers to the ‘initiation crisis’ or the ‘call’, and it is profound, in the sense that it is of severe psychic depth. During the initiation process, the body is often quite sick, even comatose, whilst the ‘spirit’ is being taught, challenged, trained, and initiated, before it returns to the body, which then also heals. Healing referred to in this context is about becoming ‘whole’, a far cry from what we in our society see as ‘healing’, which refers mainly to symptom alleviation. </p>

<p>I don’t necessarily think that there is a ‘shamanic personality type’, but believe that there are different reasons that draw people to shamanism. Let’s start with wounding. In contemporary societies, we can say that there is individual wounding, such as we all experience to various degrees. Then there is a kind of collective wounding, which we are subjected to because the road travelled collectively results in disconnected populations in our soul-less societies. Increasing levels of anxiety disorders, depression and violence are indicators of this development. You are of course right, not everyone wounded becomes a shaman. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-2.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Water Altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Water Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>But in my experience, being drawn to shamanism often takes place through being wounded individually and/or through feeling our collective wounds. If you don’t feel that something is ‘not right’, then you have very little incentive to step off the normal road and travel down a different one. So, yes, I do know from experience that many people who travel the road of shamanism have been wounded. But having said that, as humans we also have the ability to see beyond our individual existence; so now there is a second, rather large group of people drawn to shamanism for ecological reasons. They realize that our most urgent task is to stop destroying the earth and work towards sustainability, and that we can only achieve this if we re-connect individually and collectively with nature, again becoming part of it. Shamanism helps greatly with that. A third group of people seems to come to shamanism via searching for something that makes them feel more alive and connected, helps them to re-connect with vital life forces and community, which we, in our left-brain, artificial and consumer-orientated societies have done our best to dis-connect from. Shamanism seems to open energy gates for people, as it is very physical, very earthy, very active and communal. So, to answer the question, I don’t believe there is a personality type, but I do see several reasons why certain people are drawn to shamanism and others are not.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Searching through your book, there is not much about shamanism and dreaming or shamanic dreams. I admit the subject for me is somewhat problematic. American anthropologist Alfred Kroeber coined the term “dream culture” for particular Native tribes, such as the Mohave, where culture was kept alive through tribal members dreaming mythic narratives and rituals. Traditional Lakota women are often called to “medicine” through beckoning dreams involving visitations from spirit beings and ancestors. The Greek cult of Asclepius, which was popular throughout the Mediterranean over several centuries before Christianity, practiced dream incubation as healing technique. Sometimes in the dreams of alchemists, ancient or contemporary, there are shamanic motifs, even a shamanic core, so that by peeling away the imagery of the alchemist you find the ritual of the shaman. </p>

<p>Then bringing many threads into a skein, I would say—dreaming power objects or animals, spirit guides, ancestors and archetypes could all be elements of shamanic dreaming. But I invite you now to share your experiences and your thoughts on shaman dream traits and shamanic dreaming, and how such can be of healing value to non-tribal and mostly urban-dwelling people today. What can you tell us? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> Yes, I do not specifically address ‘shamanic dreaming’ in my book because it has been written for therapeutic professionals of many creeds, and there is only a small minority of therapists and psychologists, mainly Jungians and eco-psychologists, who work with dreams. I also didn’t want to begin explaining in the book the idea of ‘dreaming’ in a shamanic sense. You already outlined much that can be said about ‘shamanic dreaming’, and of course how it overlaps with other forms of ‘work attempted in trance states’, but let me add a few bits before I come to the more individualized, western way of utilizing dreams. If we take into account what you mentioned, and if we look at tribes such as the Kogi in South America, or the Australian Aboriginal’s ‘dreamtime’, then we realize that dreaming in a shamanic sense is at least two-fold: firstly, shamanic dreaming is practiced to access wisdom, insights, guidance, rituals, healing approaches, knowledge, creativity and so on from the wider field, the spirit field; and secondly, shamanic dreaming is also practiced to create ‘reality’ within that wider energetic field, which then manifests in our material reality. So, in a way all ‘work’ undertaken by shamans or tribal members in an altered state of consciousness could be defined as ‘dreaming’. We ‘dream’ our reality into being. The Kogi, for instance, would tell you quite categorically, that this is what they do normally and that without their ‘positively dreaming the world into being’ we would have already ended in complete destruction. </p>

<p>When we use the expression “dreaming” in a westernized, contemporary way, it is for the stuff that happens when we sleep, in contrast to the shaman who dreams deliberately, even if she or he is awake. Here, in a therapeutic environment, we do not use the shamanic way of dreaming for therapeutic purposes, but we do understand that insights and wisdom can arise in dreams and that healing can take place. What we access in dreams is defined as stemming from the personal unconscious or, more rarely, the collective unconscious. But generally speaking, we apply a very limited framework compared to the framework of indigenous, older cultures. </p>

<p>I personally believe that, in comparison to shamans, we have restricted the world we access and live in because we do not access and utilize dream states deliberately. But, I will leave it at that, because your next question, which I have already seen, will give me a chance to go deeper into the whole idea of ‘altered states’. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Ok then, let’s talk about ecstasy—about shaman as master or mistress of ecstasy—and how mantic and other altered states of consciousness can be viewed as therapeutic experience and might be applied in conventional therapeutic settings. This is also a problematic topic for me. We are familiar with trance dancing, tribal-fusion dance, what is called authentic dance, Gabriella Roth’s sweating prayers and Bradford Keeney’s explorations of shaking medicine. Nonetheless, the subject remains problematic, especially in most professional and many public settings. I have attempted to find a place for, and yet set a limit to, ecstasy in relationship to performance in my writings on eco-shamanic actor training. So I am looking to learn something from you. Ecstasy, degrees of shamanic altered states and therapy in contemporary England and elsewhere: what can you say about it?</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-3.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="Altar"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Altar</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>CM: I mention in my book, rather accusingly, that modern societies are the only societies where trance states are frowned upon, discouraged, sometimes even penalized. With the onset of the age of reason and enlightenment and with the development of science, we began to worship the ‘god of conscious, rational mind’, whilst neglecting, rejecting and belittling the wisdom and insights that stem from altered state experiences. But I believe that trance states are natural states, that we all have an innate longing for altered state experiences and that we haven’t done ourselves a favor by depriving ourselves of the vast reality we can access, the wisdom we can gain, the connection to the wider field in many manifestations we are capable of experiencing by altering our dimensions of awareness and perception. So, trance states, altered states, states of ecstasy, however you want to call them, are something we know very little about, whilst we know quite a lot about ‘conscious mind’, which is the least interesting, the least creative and the least influential state of mind we can be in. </p>

<p>What you said about such states being ‘problematic in most professional and many public settings’ certainly applies in the UK as well. In my book, I describe in-depth what we know about ‘altered states’ as I still find it unbelievable, often infuriating, that even in the field of therapy, these states are seldom seen as valuable. Personally, I think that it’s deliberately produced fear that keeps us ‘away from them,’ even though we all long to be ‘in them’. I say this because each new generation finds ways and means to use mind-altering substances, and as soon as a new one comes along, legislation is created to criminalize its use. Indigenous cultures, especially shamans of many creeds, in many places, use mind-altering plants to produce altered states. I personally think that as long as we are kept on the level of ‘mind’ rather than being encouraged to experience ‘expanded consciousness’, we will, collectively, restrict our development. This is not quite the place to go deeper into the subject, but just briefly one point, to illustrate this opinion: ‘mind’ is based on survival within this material reality and within this body. Mind can therefore be manipulated and controlled as it is, on a very basic level, geared up towards survival in social normalcy, reacting with fight or flight when threatened. Holistic psyche works on a different level. Through altering our state of psyche (soul) we can begin to experience the levels of connective possibilities, and begin to understand that this manifested, material reality is just one reality. We can only imagine the positive changes in thinking, behaving, attitudes and so on if we would, collectively, come to embracing this difference. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6shaman-5.jpg" width="500" height="auto" alt="One of Christa’s Gatherings"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of Christa’s Gatherings</i></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> On various pages throughout your book, Christa, you write about near death experience (NDE). My next question addresses that. Do you see correlation between the constellation of shamanic dreaming, soul flight and NDE? There is, of course, what is called the “little death” of shamanic initiation; even Shakespeare draws parallels between sleep and death with Hamlet brooding on “what dreams may come.” What connections do you see here to share with Dream Network readers? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> I used the Near Death and also dismemberment experiences in my book in an attempt to convey an idea about the extreme level of ‘state altering’ that traditional, indigenous shamans are able to achieve. I also used the ND experiences to make a case for consciousness being non-local or bound by time. Only if we assume that consciousness is non-local and is able to travel outside of the confinements of our physical brain, can we begin to understand shamanic dreaming, soul flight and the idea that we are capable of accessing information from reality’s wider field, as well as creating from within this field. So the Near Death Experience is just one form of ‘state altering’--- albeit, an extreme one. </p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> In Faust, Goethe speaks of the Realm of the Mothers, the dark feminine, to which Faust must journey to attain wholeness. I know that the role of the feminine is important in your shamanism, psychology and ecosophy. That is Earth Wisdom. In closing, would you share something on this subject? </p>

<p><strong>CM:</strong> Yes. But I don’t quite understand the ‘dark feminine’ yet and would rather talk about open aspects of the feminine, which we need to honor, integrate and live by. What I do understand is that long ago woman was believed to have a special, magical connection with earth, trees, plants, animals, with the rhythms of nature--- indeed with the rhythm of all life. Why? Because woman gives life, woman nurtures and sustains life, and woman is prepared to lose her own life to give birth. Woman is also patient. She incubates the seed, just as Mother Earth does. She nurtures her young for long periods. Woman is, in that sense, close to nature, to its rhythms and ways. Woman is also close to the divine, the sacred, as nature is the manifestation of the earth-sacred, of life itself. The very basic, but major aspects of the feminine principle are therefore life giving, nurturing, protecting, co-creating and giving of oneself to the young. With this, woman participates in the life of nature as ‘mother’. We are talking archetypal here and therefore we need to go back to basics. The feminine is genetically programmed towards intuiting, emotional connectedness, and communicating in a group, mainly through having and raising children. So, if we take all those basic feminine aspects and look at the world now, we realize that none of them are valued highly. The opposite is the case. Here are a few examples: we don’t nurture earth, we exploit it; we don’t communicate and connect, we use force and pressure, then go to war to dominate and to get what we want. Most of our religious systems are completely based on the masculine, with male deities and hierarchical structures created and occupied by men. Our economic systems are geared towards profit accumulation for the few, rather than communal well-being. On the whole, society belittles emotionality and intuition, preferring what is rational, male. And almost everywhere now, the evolutionary rise of the feminine brings on repressive violence against women. </p>

<p>Yet if we want to solve the earth crisis, rather than being eliminated by the earth—if we want to evolve spiritually as well as in humaneness—we need to redress this imbalance. For a long time to come, we need to focus on bringing into the fore the basic aspects of the feminine—that which is deep, life incubating, life giving, life sustaining and life nurturing. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>The dream mind takes everything in. It makes pictures and stories out of more data than we consciously realize we have at our disposal. The dream mind sees everything fresh. It combines something that happened yesterday with something that happened twenty years ago to liberate an entirely novel perception. Its scope is broader because it is less focused. Perhaps we might vaguely compare the dream mind with the coarse adjustment system on a microscope and the waking mind with the high power fine adjustment apparatus. It is obvious to us that when using the microscope to best advantage we must move back and forth between the two systems. How strange that we are never trained to use our minds in this way also. The dream mind is virtually ignored by our educational system. Our waking minds are trained as if they operated alone, as if they were the only minds we had. What an interesting folly we have created. </p>

<p>This folly becomes patently evident after a while to one who works with his own dreams. Perhaps at first he sees the folly of his life as an inadequacy of his own. He is at the "Something-Is-Wrong-With-Me" stage. But after he has worked with many many dreams and filled several shelves with the dream journals, he becomes aware of himself in a different way and starts to see the world differently too. When he becomes aware of his own ignorance, he is not ignorant anymore. To the degree that he is able to realize his continuing ignorance, he becomes wise. When he can admit his total ignorance, that man is enlightened. All this is called the Creative Process by some. Others call it The Path. It is operative in every individual who has freed himself from conditioning. He is not a robot anymore. He is a human being. The only thing that can condition one such as this is the reality of the moment as he perceives it with his own ever more refined senses. He begins to see through the shallow forms of culture to its universally denied essence. For example, whereas millions adhere to the belief that the Virgin Birth was something that happened to the mother of Jesus in history, he sees that myth as a metaphor for the Creative Process each of us must go through in order to be reborn from our minds into our hearts, a higher site of intelligence. For when we are thinking with our feelings, we are thinking accurately. We discover that our feelings are our thoughts. Such complicated thoughts! We cannot easily accommodate them but if we ignore them a false kind of intelligence is born in us. Our minds can no longer think. They are stupid. They are blocking out too much data. They settle for false substitutes for the thing itself. We aren't playing with a full deck anymore. </p>

<p>A timely example is the "jihad" or Holy War of the Moslems. Today there are millions in Iran willing to slaughter their own ethnic brothers in the service of this "Holy" mission. But the Holy War is not a war between men or nations. It is a war within each of us. Its weapons are not violence and treachery but peace and love. It is the Creative Process of reowning the whole of ourselves. If we are locked up in our bodies, it means reowning our minds. If we are locked up in our minds, it means reowning our bodies. We can be locked up in our hearts too if that was the only place of refuge we had during the course of our development. What a turbulent black hole this place can be and many of us are perhaps a little psychotic. How else to explain the world we create around us? Of course, we don't see our world as psychotic. Do you think the Iranian zealot sees how crazy the order is that he serves? No, he can only see our kind of craziness, not his own. He is a blind man causing a great deal of pain and misery in the world. He is a lot like us. </p>

<p>I think it is clear that in matters of religion we are a lot like the Cargo-cultist of the Pacific Islands, going through the motions of the thing as a way to get the thing itself. We laugh at the Melanesian who makes a cardboard carton refrigerator and sits at an upturned crate "table" pretending to drink from an empty beer can in order to capture the magic that will bring him the wealth and success of the White Man. But we take our own stupid substitutes for religion just as seriously as the native takes the cardboard carton refrigerator in which he carefully replaces his rusty old beer can. </p>

<p>"O.K." I have heard some modern intellectuals say, trying to set themselves above all this stupidity, "But I am an atheist. I believe in Science. In Science we see things as they are. In Science we don't fall prey to all this foolishness. Science is Exact." Hah! How the Dream laughs every time we become exact! What pleasure it will have with us now that we think we know something! And how the Dream cries every time we turn our back on it like this, every time we sell out to a metaphor at the price of the thing itself. Let us take a look at Science, the established religion of our modern culture, and see if it is immune from the follies we inflict upon ourselves by ignoring our creative side. Anthropology is as good an example as any. </p>

<p>Let's say we live in an age of sexual suppression. Our bodies themselves dream of freedom. Let's say we are Margaret Mead. Let's say we visit Samoa. Let's say the dream in our body is liberated by the exotic surroundings. We are Anthropologists performing an exact science but do we see the Samoans or do we see what the Samoans liberate within us? Is what we are seeing not actually our own dream? One who has not worked extensively with his own dreams would object if we told him the world he sees around him with his own eyes is only his dream. But those of us who have worked ourselves in a little closer with our own dream minds have discovered over and over again that when we can own our own desires and wants and express these freely we no longer have an emotional need to misconstrue the reality we see around us. We can see things more clearly for what they are. It is only when we begin to awaken that we realize we're living a dream. New facts now come to the fore. </p>

<p>We are told now that the factual reality for Margaret Mead's reports of sexual freedom in Samoa was never there in the first place. The new facts appear to be sound. But should Margaret Mead be attacked as a bad Anthropologist? Maybe the whole thing has nothing at all to do with her. She lived in an age that longed for sexual freedom. Through her that age created a fiction that helped dispel its ignorance of itself. Through her eyes it saw in the Samoans what it needed to find in itself. I guess psychologists would call this a "projection." We see in others what we disown in ourselves. A projection is a fiction. It is something that doesn't exist "out there" but "in here." Margaret Mead gave her generation the fiction it needed to liberate itself. Gauguin was off in Tahiti, illustrating the text. </p>

<p>Our Science, like our lives, is largely a fiction. This realization is threatening to the modern intellectual who is unschooled in the ways of the dream mind. He lashes out at Margaret Mead as a bad Anthropologist. She was a good Anthropologist, but she was an Anthropologist of her time, as all others are. And among the Anthropologists of her time she was a genius. </p>

<p>What is a genius? A genius is a great artist. He may be a physicist like Einstein or a psychologist like Freud, depending on what art form he chooses. Oh how this grates against the nerve of those who need to think in categories! Their minds are in a straitjacket. Margaret Mead was a genius because she played a major role in freeing the mind of her generation from the particular straitjacket that had been imposed upon it. Should she be criticized for using Anthropology as her art form? After all, aren't all of our explorations really explorations of ourselves? Out of our body's dreams we weave art.</p>

<p>From that art we find a new reality. The sexual freedom Margaret Mead painted among the Samoans has now permeated our own culture. Like anything long buried, it has gone a little "bad" and is emerging in some strange ways. But the fresh air will shake it out a bit. It will be its old self again after a few generations, a self that it has never been able to be before, anywhere, ever. It has a freedom now it never had before. And when we begin to taste that freedom ourselves we can see why it needs to be restricted. But the difference now is that we will restrict it in our own ways, the ways that work for us, and not with the rigid formulae that are culturally imposed from a time in history when conditions were not as they are now. Margaret Mead and the other great artists of her generation set us free. The world as they saw it was a fictitious creation of their own dreams. Their dreams became our actuality. As a result, we can see the world a little differently. We can see the Samoans a little differently. Anthropology has changed because we have changed and we see things differently now.</p>

<p>I think it is in this light that we must examine the growing controversy over Kilton Stewart's Anthropology of the Senoi and the dream psychology that a number of individuals have fashioned from it. What I am proposing we do is look at the situation in reverse. Instead of imagining that we are actually finding out the truth about the Senoi finally, let us realize that the only thing we are really exploring in our studies of the Senoi is our ability to perceive the truth about ourselves. </p>

<p>I for one am not in any position to know the facts about that tribe but from the letters I have been receiving of late, which unfortunately I have been asked not to publish, I am reasonably convinced that Stewart's Anthropology can be seen now as another fiction. It hardly matters that his study was a detailed and thorough one, as several have pointed out. The issue may not be whether he was a good or a bad Anthropologist, although it seems some are trying to make it into that. The issue may merely be that the unfelt needs of his own culture and his own generation colored what he saw and reported. Anthropology once again became an art form. Anthropology once again taught us something about ourselves. How arrogant to assume it could ever teach us anything else. How presumptuous to assume that what we see and report is ever reality itself. How blind to see our Science as anything more than a reflection of our own state of conscious development. </p>

<p>If we examine Kilton Stewart's marvelous fiction as a specimen of consciousness of the society that created it, we see our own denied dreams leaping out at us. Have you ever heard of Senoi dream workshop leader expounding on how peaceful and creative the tribe is? The very tones that he uses show that he's talking about a dream he has in his own heart, a vision he has for his own society: a vision of interpersonal harmony, absence of crime and insane violence; a vision of sharing and communication between individuals in society and between those individuals and society itself that is deep and powerful and creative. Is it any wonder that Kilton Stewart's study of a remote Malaysian tribe was seized upon by so many individuals in our society? It reflects our own dream of creative freedom from the kind of bureaucratic and repressive society that results when we ignore our dreaming mind-the kind of society that poisons our very relationship with violence and sickness. How wonderful and simple it would be if we only needed to attend to our dreams to free ourselves from all this. Maybe people were only too ready to believe Kilton Stewarts study because it was true, not for the Senoi, but for us. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen what the actual facts about the Senoi are. But we can no longer deny that Kilton Stewart's Anthropology has taught us much about ourselves. It was a picture of our own future, like fiction often is; It immediately began to permeate our lives, as good art always does. The idea got out that a healed society was possible if only we would reown our own deepest dreams, the furthermost reaches of our own consciousness, the thoughtforms of our own bodies-our feelings. Maybe a few more of us now are finally ready to let go of our dead religions and our false sciences and embark, each one of us, on the Path of the great ones from Jesus to Einstein-that process of creative transformation of self and relationship that will revolutionize our world like it has never been revolutionized before. The Science of the future will become the science of the impossible as slowly we begin to take off our straitjackets and discover ourselves, each other, and the world for the first time.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h2>Clouds</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h3>By Charles Tomlinson</h3><!--/nopreview--></p>

<pre>

How should the dreamer, on whose slow

  Solidities fix his wandering adagio,

Seizing, bone-frail, blown

  Through the diaphanous air of their patrols,

Shadows of fanfares, grails of melting snow?

  How can he hope to hold that white

Opacity as it endures, advances,

  At a dream's length? Its strength

Confounds him with detail, his glance falls

  From ridge to ridge down the soft canyon walls.

And, fleeces as it may seem, its tones

  And touch are not the fleece of dream,

But light and body, spaced accumulation

  The mind can take its purchase on:

Cloudshapes are destinies, and they

  Charging the atmosphere of a common day,

Make it the place of confrontation where

  The dreamer wakes to the categorical call

And clear cerulean trumpet of the air.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>It is the role of the dream to wake us up to nuances and other dimensions of perception. What we can dream, we can become. The purpose of working with dreams is to bring those kinds of perceptions into our waking lives where they can confront the intellectualized, thinking-based fiction that we might otherwise settle for as our personal reality. There is something impossible about confronting the dream on any terms other than its own. And when we confront it on its own terms, our lives can't help but be transformed by its dimensions and transfused with clarity and poetry.</em></p>

<h2>untitled poem</h2>

<h3>by David Dunn</h3>

<pre>

the white necks of the swans

catch the pulse of the moonlight

thru the branches

a woman who can not sleep

in this heat

walks along the edge of a bay

or lake.

the swans drift in circles.

the woman lays in the damp grass.

she dreams of a man

that her touch

turns into a swan.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Could it be that much of psychology has it backward and that the objects of our waking joys are, as often as not, only symbolic of what we really need, not the real thing? Could it be that, in our dreams, the real thing can burst through this waking symbolism and appear for what it really is? In our dreams, we are so close to the heat of what we really feel that we can sleep no more in the slumber of sublimations and substitutions that we settle for in waking life. Our real needs are felt for what they are.</em></p>

<h2>SHAMANIC No. 3 (First Guard: Snow Leopard)</h2>

<h3>by John T Kellnhauser</h3>

<pre>

Across the mountainpeak Ellesmeres

where spring never arrives,

the glacial years' collision of continents

have carved ice cliffs

none but the most magnificently furred

can travel without falling.

Quick rosettes - silver hoar

grey between boulder shadows,

the sun ignites the snow -

painlight bursts in

to crowd the eyes from their sockets.

Some men go blind, looking.

At night there is ever

only shadow swirling,

pale whites, unfocused penumbrance

amid black and black grey.

Certain things live

to be only almost seen,

to purr "I Exist"

and leave a single clawprint's

question mark

on the snowcrags of the mind.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Is the poet writing about consciousness states or about landscapes? Or is there a modality of cognition where the two are the same and where what is seen is realized as a metaphor for what is unseen, felt? Dreamstates, powerful yet furtive like snow leopards, leave their imprints upon the snow of our waking minds, but only their imprints. Working with dreams, we can hope for more than the occasional tracks that that other creature in us leaves across our lives, we can come face to face with him, we can become something that is at once him and ourselves. We are that purring bundle of warmth and life that inhabits the frozen landscape of our waking lives and, at the same time, we are that frozen landscape also. Somehow, it is very natural for things to be like this. This is the consolation that the snow leopard teaches us and, cold and desolate as our lives become, we can always know that something alive and warm thrives in us, purring "I Exist."</em></p>

<h2>Dream of the Factory</h2>

<h3>by Alan Steinberg</h3>

<pre>

The long hair of your dreams

is tangled in the machinery

of your life.

Somewhere there is a switch

that will turn off the whole assembly,

but a metal fist holds you.

  Look now, from the corners of your

startled eyes - the spindles of thread

are spinning on their shoots, pulling

and twining the flax of your mind,

the memories spun out in little snatches

of color, the emptiness

in long stretches of white or gray. Already

you have lost the knowledge of words

lost even the reflex of screaming.

Now your legs would not support you,

nor would your hands remember

the direction of your face.

</pre>

<pre>

Only when the shuttles of the great loom

lurch into action

are you released to consciousness

upon the bed - the metallic grating

still vibrating through your bones.

You stare at the ceiling in the dark

sweating

What are they weaving there, in the big room?

For a moment you think of silk gowns,

of Persian carpets and flame-yellow shawls.

But no, no - somewhere sack cloth

is being jerked from bolts

and stitched,

and the brush of floating lint

reminds you of life

but only for a moment.

</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>Why is it that we are not, most of us, fully conscious in dreams without awakening? Why is it that perhaps 95% of the population are not lucid dreamers? Could it be because, if we were, we would interfere with the dream too much? Could it be that what we would weave for ourselves with mental interpretations is gunny sack cloth when compared to the Persian carpet that some other agency within us, or working through us, is destined to arrive at? What is being woven in dreams is not just our own lives but the destiny of the human race. What is being fabricated in our dreams is something larger and more intricately beautiful than any of us could ever possibly be aware that we are a part of. Our lives are so much more impoverished than our possibilities. But the dream keeps moving, generation by generation, to the surface. It knows its own time, and it knows its time will come. It is the living bud. Our theories and ideas are the dry scales that fall from it.</em></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Bob Trowbridge</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><em>Those who know <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a> tend to see him as an easygoing teddy bear of a man with a quick wit and strong sense of humor as well as a warm and accepting nature. His insight and wisdom make him a popular speaker and dreamworker.</em></p>

<p>Until dreamwork came along I didn't have much direction in my life. I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I told people I wanted to be a bum; but not poor. When I went before a committee of ministers and laypeople to determine my readiness to enter seminary and the ministry, someone asked me why I wanted to become a minister. I said, "It beats getting an honest job." </p>

<p>I have had life-long dream recall, went through a period of pretty impressive nightmares (witches) and have had spontaneous lucid dreams at least since young adulthood. In high school I read a lot of religious material and in college plenty for my psychology degree. It was all grist for the mill but didn't make my direction really clear. </p>

<p>In 1976, while reading something from Edgar Cayce, I had this incredible mental explosion of very high energy that stayed with me for weeks. I was reading his ideas on the physiology of dreams and I started making all these connections between different dream ideas that were floating around in my head. I wrote down about a dozen theories pertaining to the electrical/chemical aspect of dreaming. </p>

<p>At about the same time, I began reading Seth's ideas about dreams, and it was like coming home. I kept having little precognitive dreams about the material I would read in Seth the next day. </p>

<h2>VOICE OF A DREAM EXPERT</h2>

<p>While walking down the street in San Rafael, I heard a voice in my head say, "You're an expert on dreams." Now that was a totally foreign thought to me - something I did not rationally believe to be true. I knew a lot about dreams and was working with my own, but certainly did not consider myself to be an expert. But that thought, added to the energy I was experiencing, gave me the impetus to put a flyer together and offer a dream class. I had never even taken a dream class! I got two people to sign up, padded the class with friends and launched my dreamworker career. </p>

<p>Then I heard a woman on the radio being interviewed about Seth so I wrote the station and suggested that they have a program on dreams and that I be the guest. I thought I might hear from them in a couple of months or never. I sent the letter on Friday. On Monday I had an upset stomachache that continued into Tuesday. I couldn't find any explanation for the queasiness and generalized anxiety I was feeling. Wednesday morning the station called, said they had a cancellation and could I come on the show that night? That was precognitive anxiety!</p>

<p>There I was in the middle of my first dream class with my friends and I go on the radio as a dream expert! Well, I was absolutely calm, professional and brilliant on the show. I didn't even use my notes. From that point on, whenever the interviewer, Don Chamberlin, wanted a dream person on his show, it was me. Every four to six weeks I'd go on for one to three hours and take calls from people about their dreams. It was very popular. Then the newspaper got interested and I was interviewed twice within my first year of dreamwork. </p>

<p>I came to dreamwork with a kind of ignorance and innocence which was a real boon to me because I didn't have a preconceived notion of what was or wasn't possible. I just did things and people picked up how simple it was. </p>

<p>Nowadays I do visualization work which is very powerful. It's a way for people to bring up symbols on the spot - a waking dream. I lead a channeling group, do regression workshops and with Steve Marks offer seminars for nurses under the banner of Healing Arts Associates. </p>

<p>I have been editing The Men's Journal for the past three years and, of course, have recently taken on editing <em>DNB</em> with Linda. I had always been a loner and done things on my own. Now I'm really enjoying connecting with people through these publications and through my involvement with the Bay Area Dreamworkers Network. It's great to learn about so many different and exciting methods of dreamwork! </p>

<h2>WAKING UP TO THE POSITIVE</h2>

<p>I usually do my own dreamwork and meditation while walking, since I get restless trying to sit still. </p>

<p>My feeling about the significance of dreams is that there are two things that need to happen for us to move into our fullest selves. One is dream lucidity and the other is waking lucidity. Dream lucidity or out-of-body experiences, states that I think are very similar, mean more consciously creating what we want and confronting the things that stand in our way. Lucidity in the waking state means bringing our dreaming consciousness into our waking life. It is tantalizingly possible that some of the things we're capable of accomplishing in the dream state could be accomplished in the waking state - if we are lucid. It means waking up to who we are. </p>

<p>Dream lucidity and OBEs allow us to explore just about anything that we want. We can use lucidity to talk to our dream guides face to face. We can explore the past to see if there are places where our energy is blocked. We can explore the future to check out probabilities and choose which ones we would like to activate. We can simply use the dream state to try to move into our own most positive selves, to generate and embrace our positive images. We are willing to look at the negative images in our dreams and struggle with and confront our shadows, but we are less willing to accept positive images as parts of ourselves. Part of dreamwork in the future is to pay attention to the positive images in dreams. They are there to stretch and expand us, to expose us to our greater selves. </p>

<p>My goal is to close that gap between who I am able to act out at this point and who I really am and know myself to be. I realize that there is a cleansing and a healing involved and an incredible letting go of past and future. And I must die to my old self in order to move into that new self, all of which is scary. I had a dream about this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My spirit guide, Doug (don't laugh; I know of one named Ted), is wearing a suit, looking successful and driving a big dark Cadillac convertible. The road goes to a wire mesh fence and beyond into a vineyard. But there is no gate. Doug just magically drives through the fence. I walk up to it intending to pass through as well. But I bump into the fence. There are two families, one good and one bad. The father of the good family explains to me that Doug is a Wizard which is why he can drive through. I reply, sadly, "I'm a Wizard too."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <em>am</em> a Wizard, and I am a Wizard after the fashion of the Wizard of Oz. And what is the significance of the Wizard of Oz? He was a humbug, a phony. The Wizard of Oz could not give anything to the seekers that they didn't already have. A good Wizard can help individuals to see and accept what they already have <em>and</em> a good Wizard can give individuals symbols or, better yet, let them find their own, to represent what they already have, what they already know, who they already are.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Art by Angela Mark</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>One of the most important legacies of Sigmund Freud, the great 20th century pioneer of dream exploration and father of the contemporary dream work movement, is his idea that ALL dreams, no matter how innocent and innocuous they may appear to be at first glance, carry significant layers of meaning related to the dreamer's sexuality and repressed sexual longings. Using the contemporary dreamer's "aha!" of recognition-which in my view is the only reliable touchstone in the search for and verification of the deeper meanings of dreams below the surface of obvious appearance-it regularly turns out that Freud was quite right! At least to this extent: contemporary dreamers blush, and stammer, and shift around in their seats, and otherwise confirm the symbolic sexual nature of their seemingly "nonsexual" dream experiences on a regular basis. </p>

<p>In the dream world, going through a door turns out to be sexual... not going through a door turns out to be sexual. Swimming in dreams is sexual. Eating in dreams is sexual. Using a sewing machine in a dream is extremely sexual, even if the dreamer uses a sewing machine in waking life without being consciously aware of its sexually charged quality... In fact, any list of this kind of "sexual imagery in dreams" is endless because everything in a dream has sexual overtones, undertones, and implications... among other things. </p>

<p>These layers of sexual symbolism may not be the most important or significant layers of meaning in any given dream, but they are always present. All dreams carry these layers of sexual resonance, along with many others, including symbolic reflections of the dreamer's physical health, his or her emotions, past influences, concerns about the future, "day residue," creative problem solving, etc... to name only a few of the most obvious. It is this inherent, "over-deter- mined", "multi-vocal" quality of dreams that makes working with them in groups-where participants are encouraged to share their projections and potential insights, such a rewarding and productive experience-and makes working with one's own dreams in solitude such a problematic technique. Working with one's dreams in solitude is a noble and necessary occupation but, in the long run, without help from others, the self-generated "aha!"s of the dreamer alone will inevitably cluster up along the lines of what he or she already knew and believed to begin with, and no dream ever comes just to tell the dreamer what he/she already thinks or knows consciously. Among the multiple layers of meaning and significance that are always present in every dream, there is always something new or novel and it is precisely these layers of innovative, fresh possibility that the solitary dreamer has the greatest difficulty recognizing without the help of others. </p>

<p>Whenever a dreamer dreams of some sort of overt, explicit sexuality and sensual encounter, most contemporary dream workers are inclined to take these images and experiences more or less at face value, assuming that they merely emphasize the already sexual implications of the dreaming experience. In practice, we tend to explore the sexual/relational aspects of such dreams with even more zeal and attention. This often generates interesting and valuable "aha's!" of insight, but it also tends to miss perhaps the most important point: these overtly sexual images and experiences are themselves symbolic of other, often even deeper orders of longing. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6uality-1.jpg" alt="Two people embracing around a tree" width="300" height="auto"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Art by Angela Mark</i></div>

<p>We human beings appear to be inherently predisposed to symbolize the deepest and most persistent longings in our lives as sexual/ relational feelings and desires. This seemingly universal connection and symbolic resonance between "sex" and other kinds of "deep longing" is just one example of the innate human predisposition to generate particular kinds of symbols in relation to particular kinds of experience. Carl Jung suggests that these repeating, cross-cultural tendencies reveal "archetypes of the collective unconscious," or "repeating patterns of the objective psyche". </p>

<p>Overt sexuality and sensuality in the dream world tend to resonate with the other "universal" longings that characterize the human condition, most particularly the desire to live lives in harmony with patterns and structures of meaning and significance that transcend mere personal comfort or discomfort. All humans-no matter how cynical and nihilistic we may pretend or appear to be-have a deep, inescapable hunger to believe that our lives, joys and sufferings mean something. I would call this universal longing "spiritual" (although I admit that the word "spirituality" is swiftly becoming somewhat tacky and shopworn through overuse in the "New Age" movement, I have been unable to find an adequate replacement for the word "spiritual"). </p>

<p>Frustrated before completion, it is often a symbolic reflection of a waking experience in which the dreamer felt the possibility of a "spiritual moment," but for whatever reason chose to ignore it, not follow through and experience or explore it more fully. The "opinion of the collective unconscious" (if one may use such a metaphor), appears to be... that to actually find intimations of the (archetypal) "beloved", and not give oneself wholly and ecstatically to the encounter, is like meeting the longed-for potential life partner and not experiencing the culmination of that desire. I remember one theological school student who reported such a dream and in the ensuing discussion told a story about feeling "the Presence of the Divine" while sitting in the Berkeley City Rose Garden and then hurrying away, rather than giving herself fully to the moment, because she was "afraid she would be late for her class in the Medieval Mystics... "In retrospect, the irony highlighted by the dream was inescapable...</p>

<p>Conversely, when a dreamer experiences one of his/her unique versions of the archetypal "ecstatic orgy" dream, it is most often associated with having such an intuition of the immanence of the Divine in waking life and allowing that experience to take precedence over the mundane schedule and responsibilities of non-ecstatic, ordinary existence. It also suggests that the dreamer has found satisfactory answers and experiential solutions to his/her most pressing religious and spiritual questions and uncertainties. The archetypal dream of ecstatic sexual encounter often reflects a hard-won psycho-spiritual maturity that transcends "the problem of Evil," and the limitations of the traditional "Sin and Salvation" view of the Divine. </p>

<p>The archetypal "rape" dreams often suggest a third scenario in waking life: that the dreamer has experienced such a moment of awakening spiritual possibility, but in a context that is unusual or unexpected. Rather than transcend the boundaries of conventionality and habit, the person "shifts" the sense of wonder and possibility by an act of will and focuses it on a more familiar, conventional, and "socially acceptable" practice. Many times, I have heard such dreams from theological students, accompanied by stories from their waking lives of encountering exotic spiritual practices which the student found strangely fascinating and attractive. These dreamers often report moments of shock in the midst of the experience, accompanied by thoughts like: "Hey! Wait a minute! I didn't come to seminary to become a Buddhist! I came here to become a better Presbyterian (or Lutheran, or Catholic, Episcopalian, or... )! I'm going to turn my attention back to the spiritual practices of my own tradition and focus this sense of exciting spiritual possibility there, where it belongs...!" Unfortunately, (or fortunately, depending on your point of view), the "opinion of the collective unconscious" appears to be that manipulating one's spontaneous spiritual/intuitive awareness by acts of will and "faith" in this fashion is tantamount to "rape". It's not that communion with the Divine does not take place in manipulated and consciously controlled situations like this, but the (symbolic sexual) connection is more like "rape" than "making love." </p>

<p>In my experience-which now extends more than 30 years, and includes working with many "rape dreams"-even when these dreams have levels of reference to actual sexual/relational abuse in the dreamer's waking life, there is always an important level of meaning associated with the impact of these experiences on his/her sense of spiritual possibility and connection. Even if such dreams are pointing to the release of previously amnesic memories of childhood sexual abuse-a situation that is, alas, all too common-these dreams also point to an even deeper level, where the impact of that abuse on the dreamer's psycho-spiritual development is also symbolically described. There is nothing like being betrayed by an adult to predispose a person to fear and mistrust "spiritual authorities" and potentially "overwhelming" spiritual experiences as an adult. </p>

<p>The good news is that all dreams come in the service of health &amp; wholeness, even the nasty, explicit dreams of rape and coercion. No dream ever comes to say, "Nyeah, Nyeah - you have these problems and there's nothing you can do about them!" If a dreamer remembers a dream with the manifest content of nasty, coercive sexual encounter-or any distressing, "nightmarish" content, for that matter-then the very fact that the dream has been remembered means that the dreamer is actually capable of dealing positively, creatively, and transformatively with all the issues that the dream raises. If the dreamer were actually unable to deal with the issues symbolically evoked by the dream, then he/she simply would not have remembered the dream in the first place. </p>

<p>For these reasons, it is always worth paying particular attention to dreams that present manifest sexual and sensual content and asking whether or not they offer symbolic reflections of the dreamer's spiritual search, and his or her longings for a more meaningful life. </p>

<p>In the midst of the latter 'dark days' of winter, 2019—just as Spring began to spring—a Beam of Light came into my life in the form of Inoshi, an NYC friend and subscriber/contributor from my years as Dream Network Journal’s steward.</p>

<p>He inquired about the current status of the publication and I informed him that the publication and I had retired 3/4 years ago, after completing my 25th year as publisher/editor.</p>

<p>He suggested that the work that had been done by previous editors and myself deserved to see the light of day, given the timeless value of the articles and dream related artwork, poetry and book reviews presented over the years.</p>

<p>We emailed back and forth, during which time he introduced me to Daniel Kennedy from Australia, an acquaintance who had also expressed an interest. After a few exchanges—and as I was responding to a current message from them—I had a memory surface of a dream I’d had several years prior. "Didn't I have a dream about this?" I immediately began a search in my online dream journal and Lo and Behold! There it is! </p>

<p>I entitled the dream: </p>

<h2>“The Resurrection of DNJ”</h2>

<h4>Dated January 18, 2017.</h4>

<p>Here are main excerpts from the dream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A young man is enthusiastic about reviving Dream Network Journal… and I say, “Let’s Go!” Another man expresses interest as well. The first man begins setting up ‘camp’ along a nearby pathway. Initially, the 1st man expresses disappointment, as he wanted to ‘steer the ship’ himself ... but he soon realizes it would be much better if we work as a team.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Then JANE FONDA—who morphs back and forth into JOAN HALIFAX— come into the picture and say “YES!"; we want involvement as well.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I’m ecstatic! Details begin falling into place, one by one. It’s truly a new beginning for the publication. (End dream) Wow, huh?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awaken SO HAPPY that Dream Network Journal is being revived!</p>

<p>Thus, on my end, began the really gruelling work of bringing dozens of boxes of back issues into the living room, sorting through them to achieve the desired outcome: a complete archive beginning (of course) with <a href="../@bcphbhe6wex/1.1">Volume 1 Number 1</a>, published by <a href="../@billstimson">Bill Stimson</a>, DN’s founder. The collection literally took over my living space and my life for several weeks/maybe months … but what fun! The memories that surfaced were like receiving boxes full of Christmas and birthday gifts on the same day. </p>

<p>Most rewarding was remembering the incredible chaos and crisis in my life that preceded the blessing of beginning the work back in summer 1989. It was Magic! </p>

<p>The awesomeness of the dozens of issues I stewarded was overwhelming. Did I really oversee this work? Was it really for 25 years? Seems like yesterday.</p>

<p>Now, a new website containing the history of Dream Network, reflections/perceptions on the history of the 'dream movement' and notably, new submissions has been launched; all of the back issues are available in .pdf format. A complete archive of hard copies was achieved and delivered by Inoshi to the New York Public Library in July 2020; Daniel is in process of facilitating a second hardcopy archive delivery to the State Library of Victoria in Australia as we speak.</p>

<p>Gathering it all together offered the joy of renewing contact with so many of you; collaborating with Inoshi and Daniel has been and remains among the more stimulating and rewarding activities of my now 82yo life.</p>

<p>All of this would not have been possible without the generous contributions many of you have and are making—especially thanks to <a href="../@kellybulkeley">Kelly Bulkeley</a> via the <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/dream-network-journal">Chuffed fundraising site</a>. Thank you! </p>

<p>My own involvement in this effort has brought me—and DNJ—out of what has been a hibernation of sorts; hoping it has the same effect of enriching your Dream Self and Life!</p>

<p>Lovingly,</p>

<p>Roberta</p>

<p>p.s. Among new submissions will be the next chapter of Bones, Dreams and the Future by <a href="../@paco">Paco Mitchell</a> and <a href="../@ral">Russ Lockhart</a>. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Dream Tending: Awakening to the Healing Power of Dreams by Stephen Aizenstat, Spring Journal, Inc, 2009, 281 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Aizenstat is highly respected as a Master of Dreamwork, his extensive study and deep connection to the power of dreams and the dreaming psyche has influenced his life’s work in a way that is extraordinary. Among Stephen's many students over the years, I remember asking him if he had ever considered writing a book about Dream Tending knowing what an incredible contribution it would be to the world if he did. I was one of many who encouraged—perhaps even begged him—to write about his teachings and ways of working with dreams. Now that this highly anticipated book has found its way into the world, it is a privilege to review it here. </p>

<p><em>Dream Tending</em> is a deeply moving, holistic and embodied way of working with dreams. It is a way in which dreams are engaged as living images who, through their ability to bridge the worlds of the dreaming psyche and the waking world, are given voice and expression. It is a way of working with dreams that allows the images to speak to us on behalf of themselves, allowing us to be a part of the process versus the center of it, inviting the world psyche to interact with us as part of a whole, living, breathing organism. </p>

<p>Whether you are an experienced dreamer or just beginning, this insightful and rich book contains practical methods and exercises for working with your own dreams. Stephen goes into great detail on how to develop relationship with dream images and how to engage them on an ongoing basis, making <em>Dream Tending</em> a “life practice”, as well as fostering an ongoing relationship with your own inner “Dream Council” of figures. </p>

<p>In addition, Stephen offers his readers a step-by-step guide to access the living power of their dreams to: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Transform nightmare figures into profound and helpful mentors </p></li>
<li><p>Bring fresh warmth and intimacy into relationships </p></li>
<li><p>Overcome obsessions, compulsions, and addictions </p></li>
<li><p>Engage the healing forces of dreams through imaginal “medicines” </p></li>
<li><p>Re-imagine careers and cope with difficulties in the workplace </p></li>
<li><p>Discover the potential of untapped creativity </p></li>
<li><p>See the world with a new and dynamic perspective</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Dream Tending</em> is a life practice that healers, storytellers, and poets have known by many different names for thousands of years. Passed on through the generations, the art of tending living dream images emerges in a culture when the call to see the natural world as alive is urgent.” (Quoted from page 11, The Living Image) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is true that we are in a period of great transition. Never before have we experienced our world in such deep need of healing, yet we must look to the hidden blessings in these times. Perhaps we are being reminded to slow down and make space for a re-connection to the Earth, to the animals, to our family, our friends, our neighbors and to ourselves. One way to navigate these times is to turn inward, to sit quiet and allow a new sensibility to come forth, not through the mind, but through the soul. Working with dreams allows us to experience our world in a way not just heard through the ears and seen with the eyes, but felt, deeply into the cellular makeup of who we are, which we share with all other living things. We are being called to act on behalf of something bigger than ourselves, we are being called to live as a global community, where respect for each other and our planet are not only desired, but essential to our well being and our future. What better time than now to intimately engage the dreamtime and allow it to open us up to new possibilities to heal both ourselves and our planet, one dream at a time.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Aizenstat, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist, marriage and family therapist, and the founding president of Pacifica Graduate Institute. For more than 35 years he has explored the power of dreams through the study of depth psychology and the pursuit of his own research. He has collaborated with many masters in the field, including Joseph Campbell, Marion Woodman, Robert Johnson, and James Hillman; as well as native elders worldwide. Dr. Aizenstat has conducted hundreds of dreamwork seminars throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. He lives with his wife and three children in Santa Barbara, California.</em> (Quoted from the cover of DreamTending) </p>

<p></a></p>

<p>I have been searching for a new career. As various offers have come my way, I incubate a dream to see if this is the correct job opportunity for me to pursue. </p>

<p>On one occasion, I dreamt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I saw a set of dice about to be tossed. They had rhinestones or diamonds where the black dots should be.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I interpreted this to mean that the job was a gamble, or a toss of the die. It could be lucrative, but it was a definite risk. I did not pursue this job offer. </p>

<p>On another occasion, I dreamt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My husband and I were both working for the company that had offered me a position. We had to sign up to volunteer work at a marathon. My husband was more enthusiastic about volunteering than I was.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I interpreted this to mean that the job would be a long haul with very little income. I chose to pass on the offer. </p>

<p>During this past June I came upon an opportunity to run my own business. The more I explored the concept, the more excited I became. It seemed that I had at last found the correct occupation that would make use of my talents. The dream I had to clarify the pursuit of this occupation was as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I see a very handsome young man walking toward me in the hall of the college that I attend in the dream. I wish that I could somehow meet him and have lunch with him because I am powerfully attracted to him. Obviously he feels that same way when he sees me because he turns around in the hall and approaches me. We carry on a conversation. I tell him I'm a senior and he indicates that he is a freshman transfer student. He should be a sophomore, but he lost credits when he transferred. I wonder if I'll be teased about him being younger than I am. Later on, he shows up at the dorm room I share with a learning disabilities teacher. He and I kiss passionately, and I'm hooked!</em></p>
  
  <p><em>We are now in a bed making love and I'm wondering why me breasts aren't as aroused as they usually are during passionate love-making. This is my first sense that maybe this relationship isn't all that it's supposed to be... Even though I'm extremely aroused and passionately involved.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>The scene changes. We're in a car and he stops to buy some drugs. The police pull us over. The like him because of his easy manner and good looks. He is let off the hook with a warning. Meanwhile, the whole time we're in the car, I'm still passionately aroused and desperately want a climax but never achieve one.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<p>I interpreted this dream to mean that though the job was seductive and I was passionately exploring this as an occupation, it had the possibility of some real problems for me in the future (actually drugs could easily be hidden and transported in this business). It also indicated that I would be left without fulfilment, the climax I so desperately wanted in the dream. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Dreamers inspired by poets—poets inspiring and guiding Dreamers. One particular poet and one particular Dreamer come together on a joint venture of mutual interest and the result is Robert Moss’s <em>The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead: A Soul Traveler’s Guide to Death, Dying and the Other Side</em>. Divided into three distinct and interconnected sections, The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead offers what could very well be the beginnings of a much needed Book of the Dead for the Western (industrialized) world. </p>

<p>Two of Moss’s strongest points are that Imagination is a necessary and vital element of the afterlife—and—dreaming is our most direct access to learning about and preparing for life after physical death. But Western culture tends to view Imagination with the same suspicious and disapproving eye it uses on dreams/dreaming. Consequently, our understanding of the afterlife is vague, incomplete, and constricted. Both the dead and the living in Western culture suffer from a lack of information. This book endeavors to provide some practical tools and guidelines to “help us heal our relationship with death and dying.” It is a relationship sorely in need of healing. The first section, <em>Dreaming with the Departed</em>, draws on dreams and tales of the afterlife from other cultures as well as contemporary dream reports. While reminiscent of Patricia Garfield’s <em>The Dream Messenger</em>, Moss offers an expanded view of this type of dream. He explores not just the common themes and messages in such dreams but also lays a foundation for deeper and more conscious dialogues/interactions between living and dead. Yes, the dead visit us in our world, via dreams, but we visit them in their world as well, gaining our own glimpses into the bardos beyond. There is a process, a path, a pattern to the afterlife, and different kinds of energy and consciousness survive physical death. Sometimes the dead need help from the living. Many don’t know they have died, for instance, or we hold them too close or too long and they remain earthbound longer than they might have otherwise, or they don’t know (because of beliefs held during physical life) that they <strong>can</strong> go on. Dreaming of the dead is part of the dying/death/healing process for both the living and the dead and Moss offers specific suggestions for the living which assist both living and dead – not just ‘feel good’ rituals, but practical matters such as sudden or violent deaths, unburied/missing bodies, the dense energy body of the ‘stuck’ dead, entanglement with this denser energy, etc.. Moss reiterates the necessity of imagination in the afterlife (“…lack of imagination is one of the main reasons people get stuck on the other side of death”). It is the key to a deeper dialogue between the living and dead, and a necessary element in a Western Book of the Dead. Ultimately, Western culture benefits from a more active and conscious communion with the other side of the veil. </p>

<p>If <em>The Dreamers Book of the Dead</em> stopped after Part One, it would still be a valuable addition to any dreamworker’s library. It doesn’t stop, of course, but continues with an exploration of The Poet as Guide to the Other Side. Here, Moss describes his interactions with and guidance by the spirit of W. B. Yeats, an early Twentieth Century poet whose own efforts at writing a Western Book of the Dead resulted in <em>A Vision</em> (1925 &amp; 1937). He learns more about the afterlife through a variety of experiences (dreaming, shamanic drumming/journeying, travels to and visits from others who had died, etc.), with Yeats as his guide much as Virgil was Dante’s guide. There are numerous references to other individuals and groups who have traveled this path in earlier times (the Victorian era, for example). This section provides much of the larger context which ties the other two sections together. Throughout the whole of the book, as well, are poems and stories from other cultures which further bring us from where we are to where we could be in our own culture’s relationship to death and dying. </p>

<p>Dreaming the Way from Death to Birth is where we are headed in finally creating a Western Book of the Dead. Here are tools and guidance to help us truly begin to heal that relationship with death/dying. By learning (and helping others learn) how to prepare/maintain our personal ‘houses of death’, we can be ready when it is our turn. Stories from many dreamers and many traditions, as well as descriptions of Moss’s own experiences and what he has learned, make up much of this section. Several short meditations are offered as examples to help in visualizing different ways of starting on your journey after death. A brief summary of common ‘steps’ found on the other side is also given, though individual experience will, of course, be shaped by one’s own beliefs and expectations about what is on the other side. Reincarnation is touched on as well, as are some other ‘non-western’ concepts (being alive in more than one time period at once, for example). </p>

<p>At the end of his book, Moss offers additional resources, provides a description of his Dream Re-entry technique (most helpful in further exploring those dreams with the dead), and presents a very extensive bibliography with authors both ancient and modern and in a variety of fields (including Garfield’s Dream Messager). This may not be the final incarnation of a Western Book of the Dead, but The Dreamer’s Book of the Dead a really nice start. ∞</p>

<p>A myth can be described in many ways but the metaphor of a "chaotic attractor" is especially suitable. In chaos theory, there are several types of "attractors" but a "chaotic attractor" finds order in what appears to be incomprehensible data by helping us to discern an underlying pattern. In much the same way, a myth can organize a constellation of beliefs, images, emotions, motives, and values that can, in turn, bring order and direction to a society, an institution, a family, a person, or to an entire culture. From a psychological perspective, a myth is an imaginative narrative (usually expressed in words but sometimes expressed in dance, images, etc.) that addresses existential human concerns, and that has behavioral consequences. Myths are more imaginative (more accurately, "imaginal") than empirical, and this is where a mythic narrative differs from an empirical scientific narrative. Empirical science, despite its successes in explaining the workings of natural phenomena, is virtually incapable of fulfilling the other functions that myth has provided over . the millennia - assisting the passage of individuals through the life cycle with rituals and ceremonies (e.g. ways in which myths are "performed"), identifying a person's place in the social world of work, love, and play, as well as helping him or her to link with the world of spirit, of the "ground of being," or of ultimate value.</p>

<p>This essay will use these perspectives on myth (one covert, one overt) to present, for the first time, a particular transcription of a portion of oral mythology. We were honored to be allowed to record these stories during a trip to Salvador, Bahia, Brazil in 1997 where Cau Trigo, a young Brazilian man working with the Kariri Xuco tribe introduced us to Tinze, the "Nhenti" or "Keeper of the Traditions."</p>

<p>The Kariri Xuco' are a coastal tribe in the Brazilian northeast (Novaes da Mota, 1987). In the 13th and 14th centuries, the warriors of the Tupi tribe pushed the Kariri Xuco' from most of their coastal land into the interior. They now live along the west side of the San Francisco River, the second largest in Brazil, after the Amazon, with which it does not connect. Hydroelectric projects interfere with the tribe's water supply, badly needed for fishing and irrigation. Only 10% of the land they presently occupy is now legally owned by the tribe itself, the remaining property being subject to state and federal regulation and utilization.</p>

<p>This process of losing control of the land and, therefore, their destiny, began during the days of colonization. The Portuguese made slaves of the Tupi Indians, and the European historians called them the first people of the coast, not knowing that the Tupi had supplanted the Kariri Xuco' before the Portuguese arrived. It took a century for the Portuguese to locate the Kariri Xuco'. With the advent of colonization, the federation of northeast Indian groups disintegrated. The Kariri Xuco', whose culture had not recovered from their ejection from a coastal area to a dryer river area, were further destabilized by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>There were bloody skirmishes between the Indians and the colonizers. Hoping to reduce expenditures on war, the Portuguese brought Capuchin priests from France as well as Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to pacify the region. This plan succeeded but resulted in the loss of much of the Kariri Xuco' culture.</p>

<h2>Personal History of Tinze</h2>

<p>Tinze told us that he had always had an interest in the myths of his tribe. But when a child attempts to listen to the tales told by tribal elders, the custom is to tell the child to go away. Only a child with determination will respond by saying that he or she wants to stay and listen. Tinze was one of these children. In addition, he often pretended to be asleep while the elders were telling stories. He still remembers the state of consciousness he fell into during those hours- a mixture of relaxation induced by having his eyes closed, alertness needed to hear the stories, and fear of being discovered.</p>

<p>Over the years, Tinze gradually won the confidence of his elders. Little by little, he was given tasks and responsibilities. As he was successful in each of his missions, he gained more access to the stories along with new responsibilities.</p>

<p>In his early 30s at the time of our interview, Tinze told us, "From the time I was a child, I have been interested in tribal stories, and eventually I committed myself to the recovery of the Kariri Xuco' culture. I could see how a revival of these stories could stop the loss of our culture. Once I had attained sufficient wisdom, the elders listened to my ideas to reconnect members of our tribe with the spirits, with nature, and with each other." Now Tinze is the tribe's "Nheneti" or "Keeper of Traditions." This position involves secretarial work, representing the tribe to the outside world, communicating with tribal counselors and heads of families, as well as with the tribe's chief and shaman.</p>

<p>Tinze told us that such responsibilities are not common for a person as young as he is, but that the tribal leaders admired his devotion to the ways of the ancestors and his skill in harmonizing and mediating conflict within the tribe. Shortly before our interview, Tinze was honored to receive a secondhand typewriter for use in his official duties.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Myths</h2>

<p>The Kariri Xuco' believe that each river contains several "Maes do Rio" or "mothers of the river." These spirits live in the river and must be respected because of their power. Dedzu's is one of these spirits and resides in a portion of the Rio San Francisco -the San Francisco River- which originates in the state of Minais Gerais, eventually flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Kariri Xuco' fishermen try to win favor from Dedzu's because if she likes them, they will always bring home fish, and their catch will surpass that of others who have not won her affections. Indeed, some fishermen give Dedzu's so many presents - delicious foods, beautiful flowers, perfumed herbs - that their wives become jealous and see Dedzu's as a rival. But if a fisherman does not abide by Dedzu's wishes, he will catch fewer fish. And if he ignores or insults her, he is at risk for having his soul stolen. Dedzu's domain is filled with stolen souls who work as slaves to do her bidding, including going on expeditions to steal other souls. The loss of one's soul is a terrible tragedy, far worse than losing one's life.</p>

<p>Dedzu's is a spirit of the night. At midnight, she comes out of the water and visits the riverbank, where she eats the corn and beans left for her as well as putting the gifts of flowers in her hair and the perfumed herbs on her body. When surprised by a human being, she jumps back into the river and the intruder might hear a splash of water.</p>

<p>Dedzu's powers are activated by the disappearance of the sun's rays. On occasion she will allow herself to be seen by one of the fishermen she favors. Her body is beautiful but translucent; she is human in form but has gills on her neck. She wears no clothes but her long hair flows over her body. These fishermen can stroke her body and engage in intimate conversation with her, but like other Kariri Xuco' spirits, she does not engage in sexual activity with humans. She is capable of having children, however, her pregnancy sometimes being evoked by the intimacy she shares with one of the fishermen. She can become very jealous of other "Maes do Rio" and envious of the wives and girlfriends of her favored fishermen.</p>

<p>When Tinze was in his early 20s, he was accustomed to returning home with a fine catch of fish, frequently bringing back more than the other fishermen. Still, he followed the advice of his mother, who told him, "When you are fishing, be careful to avoid the river spirits. Take care not to fish too much in one place or the River Mother may entrap you." Tinze's mother suspected something of which he was unaware: the River Mother was preparing him for an intimate relationship.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Tinze began to have girlfriends and the Water Mother grew jealous. For the first time, Tinze returned to the village at the end of the day without any fish. He tired easily and spent much of his time sleeping. His friends thought that he was ill, but his mother suspected that the River Mother was trying to steal his soul. Indeed, this suspicion was confirmed in the dreams that Tinze's mother had at night about the River Mother, who accused her of being overly protective of Tinze. One way in which Tinze's mother protected him was to put a small piece of tobacco over the door of the house and also in his shorts, because this sacred plant has the power to neutralize malevolent activities of the water spirits, and of other invisible forces as well. Tobacco represents the benevolent spirits who can protect human beings from invisible forces that are negative, especially those that result in soul loss. Tinze's mother was successful and her son recovered from his weakened condition.</p>

<p>Another group of water spirits are the "Pretus do Rio," or the "Dark Ones of the River." One of the most powerful is Irotzu, another spirit of the night. Often, he stands at the river bank observing the fishermen. When a fisherman least expects it, Irotzu dives into the water; a splash is heard but nothing is seen. Yet the fishermen know that Irotzu is nearby and monitors their work carefully. They know that Irotzu will punish them if they fish during the time when fish eggs are hatching. They know that they must fish only when necessary, and must use only natural methods of fishing. For example, some men toss small bombs into the river and collect the fish that float to the surface. They are subject to the wrath of Irotzu, and if they try to protect themselves with tobacco, Irotzu will go after one of their immediate family members.</p>

<p>Women of the Kariri Xuco' tribe can fish as well as men. One of Tinze's cousins had been fishing for a long time with no success. Finally, in frustration, she called out to the river spirits, "Stop joking and give me some fish." Such a statement was disrespectful, of course. She immediately felt dizzy and almost fell out of the boat. Her sister caught her and rowed back to shore. Eventually, the transgressing woman regained consciousness, but her eyes burned badly. Her brother told her that her head looked as if it had been hit by a bow."</p>

<p>A healing session was initiated, which successfully aided the woman's recovery. The Healing God's full name is sacred and can never be mentioned in public. However, there are many healing spirits to whom prayers can be offered directly.</p>

<p>The religion of the Kariri Xuco' is syncretic. Since the time of the missionaries, members of the tribe have entered into relationships with Christian Saints through their prayers and public rituals. As Tinze remarked, "We love Jesus Christ and admire Mother Mary, but we retain our ancestors' religion as well."</p>

<p>A third water spirit is "Cabe a Grande" or "Big Head," a name applied collectively to a group of invisible children who play in the river. These spirits have heads that are disproportionate in size to the rest of their bodies. Their antics can be observed when there is a rush of white water, a sudden eddy, or an unexpected phenomenon. Tinze told us, "One day I saw a stream of water flowing against the current and knew that Big Head was being playful."</p>

<p>These spirit children do not interfere with human affairs. However, fishermen must be aware of their behavior or their boats might get caught in the rapids that develop when Big Head is making sport.</p>

<h2>Placing of Myths Within Our Perspective</h2>

<p>The narratives provided by Tinze illustrate our descriptive model of myths. On an overt level, these stories are imaginative narratives that address such important human issues as family relationships, food supply, and matters of health and safety. The narratives impact behavior, giving instructions as to how fishing must be done, how the spirits must be pacified, how souls must be protected, and how sickness must be treated.</p>

<p>On a covert level, these myths can be said to "attract" beliefs (tobacco will protect someone from malevolent spirit activity), emotions (parental concern for the souls of their children), images (the description of the Water Mother with her gifts and long hair), motivation (bringing home a fine catch of fish is so important that one is motivated to respect the water spirits), and values (the loss of one's soul is the ultimate disaster).</p>

<p>The utility of our descriptive model can be demonstrated with the myths of the Kariri Xuco'. But it can also identify mythic elements in other imaginal narratives. Fairy tales are told for entertainment, but often include moral lessons. Legends tell of semi-historical feats of heroism but frequently refer to a culture's values. Sagas are compilations of legendary accounts but the motives of their characters are frequently clear.</p>

<p>Even so, imaginal narratives that deal with superficial issues and do not contain behavioral implications lack the qualities that would qualify them as myths. In a world where chaos seems to be on the increase, the underlying attractor provided by myths can provide a sense of order to individuals as well as institutions, families as well as societies, and perhaps even to cultural revivals as we observed in Tinze' s accounts of the Kariri Xuco'.</p>

<div class="caption"><span>Bridge over Wissahickon Creek, Philadelphia, on my way to a dream share</span></div>

<p>Sometimes after class at university I used to quietly slip out of the campus to a dream sharing group. I would ride my pushbike up the wintry Wissahickon Valley in Philadelphia to a group in Chestnut Hill, or cycle downtown to the bus station, get a bad takeaway coffee to warm my hands and hop on the first bus to New York. This was 2019 and I was studying computer science abroad, the last year of a degree I started in Sydney. </p>

<p>I’d always kept a dream diary, but it was more of a private pursuit, a little secret world. I was longing at some level to meet other sympathetic souls. I had an inkling that somewhere beneath the surface of the everyday there was a loose network of dreamers, like a mycelial network under the earth. I wanted to be part of that network. I’d even wanted for a long time to start some kind of dream sharing website, and it was partly with that thought that I embarked on my computing studies in the first place. </p>

<p>Somehow the lonely church in Chestnut Hill and the shadowy outskirts of Manhattan seemed like an extension of that secret world, but indeed with other strange and wonderful people in it. One of those people was <a href="../@inoshi">Inoshi</a> (who has written an editorial alongside this one). In his Japanese-styled New York loft we’d sit drinking green tea and sharing dreams until I had to literally run back through the neon streets back to the Port Authority for a late evening bus. </p>

<p>On one of those evenings he casually showed me a copy of the Dream Network Journal, which I’d never heard of at that time. Of course the first thing I did was tap out ‘Dream Network Journal’ into my phone. When it turned out that this venerable journal of 34 years had no website online, and could not even be purchased (let alone read), something in my millennial reptilian brain was deeply disturbed. This was a gap in space-time, a glitch in the universe! Luckily Inoshi knew the last editor, <a href="../@robertaossana">Roberta Ossana</a>, from his days listing his dream group in the journal. And so the three of us banded together, started a crowdfunding campaign to put the journal online again, and here we are. </p>

<p>I think the DNJ can once again become part of the mycelial network of dreamers that lies beneath our waking world. Not THE network by any means, but one small part of a network of networks ~ the internetwork of dreams. This is the first tentative step, one small mushroom pushing from the digital earth to show there is life here under the ground. Part of that life is the huge number of people who have contributed to the Dream Network in the past, and are still active today. Another part will be new altogether. </p>

<p>Hopefully we can continue to do what the DNJ has always done - to be a forum for individual dreamers to share ideas, their latest projects, list their dream groups (yes we’d like to do that, please send us yours), and so on. </p>

<p>This is going to be an amazing decade in dreams, an amazing century perhaps. It’s been a long time coming, but I do think the web is going to facilitate better networking between dreamers than ever, and by bringing large sets of dreams together, bring unprecedented insights into our psychology. Dreams will bring tangible evidence of what people since Jung and Joseph Campbell onwards have suspected - that around the world, we share more than ‘common interests’, we share something like a collective subconscious. I suspect that in the global upheavals that will inevitably come, we will need more than utilitarian thinking to get through. We will need some symbolic hooks on which to hang our shared humanity. Dreams will be one of those hooks ~ perhaps the most ephemeral, but perhaps for that, the most beautiful.   </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Over the years that I have been doing dream work with individuals and groups, I have noticed that there is a tendency for vehicles in dreams, particularly automobiles, to reveal layers of symbolic resonance with waking life emotional relationships (among other things). Questions related to vehicles in dreams such as: "who's driving?", and "do the brakes work?", and "where are we going?' and the like, are often clearly related to issues of waking life relationship. </p>

<p>However, it would be a great error to assume that every time we encounter a vehicle in a dream, (our own or somebody else's), we are necessarily dealing with a metaphor of waking personal relationship. Only the person who has the dream can <em>know</em> what it means. When the dreamer comes to understand his or her dream more fully, there is usually a confirmatory "tingle", (or "flash", or "aha", or what-have-you), which is experienced when some truth about the dream has been discovered and articulated. </p>

<p>This tingle is created in large measure by a previously unconscious <em>memory</em> rising to the surface of conscious self-awareness and creating a spreading "ripple". From the unconscious breadths and depths from which the dream spontaneously springs, it is <em>already</em> understood. Its multiple meanings already inhere in the shape and quality of the dream itself. </p>

<p>In this important sense, <em>all</em> forms and styles of dream work are aimed at the same purpose - bringing to the surface of self-awareness some of the already existing unconscious understandtng of the meaning and significance of the dream. When we succeed in understanding a dream more fully, as the result of whatever solitary, one-to-one or group dream work, the tingle of emotional/physical confirmation is usually felt in the moment when the meaning of some aspect of the dream is "remembered" for the first time. (Sometimes people of a more introverted disposition will require solitude in order to experience the tingles of certainty, and thus will not experience tingles in the group setting as a rule).</p>

<p>However, it often happens that we have equally "tingly" flashes about the meanings of <em>other people's</em> dreams. All too often, this tingle is taken at face value, and we make suggestions and pronouncements about the other person's dream as though we knew "what it is all about". A more accurate and sophisticated understanding of these tingles about other people's dreams is that they are <em>exactly</em> the same as the tingles we have about our own dreams - in fact, they are the tingles provoked by our <em>own</em> dream - the dream we imagined for ourselves as we experienced the other person's dream narrative. The true meaning of such a flash of understanding is that the dream would have the meaning we resonate to <em>if we had dreamed it ourselves</em>. </p>

<p>Now, given the shared nature of the collective unconscious, or "objective psyche", as well as the universal qualities of human development and emotion, it is very likely that what is true for ourselves about our own dreams will also turn out to be true for other people as well. However, it is only the confirmatory tingle of the dreamer him/herself that makes an idea or interpretation meaningful and valid. In the absence of such confirmation from the dreamer, it is simply irrelevant whether the insight is "correct" or not. </p>

<p>For this reason, as well as reasons of simple politeness and group process, it is always a good idea to preface any remark we are going to make about another person's dre am (particularly any remark we imagine may be "heavy", or "on-the-case"), with words to the effect of: "Well, if it were <em>my</em> dream...". </p>

<p>This is perhaps the single most important thing to bear in mind when doing dream work - ONLY THE DREAMER CAN VERIFY THE MEANINGS IN ANY DREAM. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the failure to keep this important rule-of-thumb in mind in the middle of the effort to work wlth dreams often leads to dream work itself becoming an instrument of tyranny. Ironically, this happens most often in direct proportion to the quality and "correctness" of the dream worker's suggestions and interpretation, because the dreamer begins to imagine that the powerful tingles are the gift of the dream worker, instead of understanding that they are the result of increasing interior self-awareness. </p>

<p>However, no matter how many errors of interpretation are made, no matter how many premature closures of exploration are made, no matter how rigid and doctrinaire a given theory of dream work may be, the dreams themselves always return with a more balanced, "objective", and whole perspective. This is an important point, because there is an inherently "self-correcting" quality to dream work that simply does not exist with other forms of interior exploration. (Contemporary research as well as the testimony of ancient lucid dreamers attests that even the cultivation of self-aware lucidity in dreams does not alter this "self-correcting", spontaneous quality of the dreams themselves). </p>

<p>Perhaps this poem says it better ...</p>

<pre>

We are so clumsy, 

Dropping lightning bolts, 

Misplacing whole species of birds, 

Fumbling with mountains, 

Unsure of their proper placement. 

"Do you suppose this river might flow 

Eventually to the sea?" 

And we debate the question, solemnly, 

Exploring all the possibilities. 

Let us lay out these subtle, spiral, spirit-bodies 

Upon the turning stars 

To see just where they turn into earthquakes. 

Uncoil! 

The holes and spaces filled with darkness 

Open up 

Around our unfinished sentences - 

We can do it! 

Oooooops! 

Remember - most people never even see 

The stars we try to use for navigation, 

So even our comic, cosmic failures 

Look like success! 

</pre>

    ns1:description """<p>A little while ago, I was approached by <em>America Online</em> (AOL) to host a regular, live, real time, virtual dream group, Monday through Friday at 9:00a.m. Eastern Time. I agreed to give it a try, even though it means that I have to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and in front of my computer at 6:00am, Pacific Time... which up until now has <em>not</em> been my habit. </p>

<p>Initially, I had some reservations about working dreams through this distinctly cool and physically isolating medium: the Internet. When I imagined as carefully as I could what it might be like, I was particularly concerned that the flat and highly compressed computer communication format might inhibit the flow of imagination, relational intimacy and mutual respect so necessary for good dreamwork. </p>

<p>I decided to undertake a couple of trial runs before I agreed to host the show for AOL. Barbara Viglizzo, a colleague and former student of mine, offered to set up trial meetings in cyberspace and recruited several interested computer-competent dreamers. (Thanks, Barbara!). As we all met in cyberspace and began to do "...if it were my dream" style dreamwork, I was tremendously pleased and excited to discover that my fears were, if not groundless, at least exaggerated out of all realistic proportion. In fact, the emotionally and physically flat format of simultaneous computer chat among people in widely separated geographic locations appears to enhance many important elements that make group exploration of dreams so productive.</p>

<p>The fact that every participant appears on the screen identified only by his or her 'cyber-handle' (email address) , means that the sense of safety and protected anonymity so necessary for productive dreamwork is completely assured from the outset. My experience also convinces me that the necessity of compressing our questions and comments into two-line 'sound bites' in order to send them to the communal screen, regularly serve to discourage needless verbosity. The compressed computer screen format tends to draw us all into the work at a deeper level, more quickly than is sometimes the case in face-to-face dream groups. </p>

<p>I am also very impressed with the sense of emotional equality that is created by everyone's comments appearing on the screen in the same bland typeface, with same spacing and inflection. In face-to-face dreamwork, the comments of participants are always weighted, to some unconscious degree or another, by our responses to their physical appearance and the timbre and quality of their voices. Different people have different prejudices about who they want to listen to and take seriously and who they tend to 'time out' and dismiss. On the screen, all that is gently wiped away; all comments appear initially as equal and all the participants are much freer to discover the potential aha! of insight for themselves in the various remarks, without unconscious prejudging of the person making the comment. </p>

<p>This egalitarian anonymity is simply a given when the work is undertaken through connected computers and that alone makes 'virtual dream groups' in cyberspace a particularly good place to explore the multiple meanings of dreams that always lie below the surface of appearance and manifest content. As in face-to-face dreamwork, the different ideas and multiple perspectives offered by the many different people who constitute the virtual dream group makes it even more likely that many more of the dream's multiple levels of meaning and significance will be touched on and explored in the work... than would be likely to be touched upon working in solitude or even working on-to-one with a skilled dreamworker. </p>

<p>I regularly find myself musing more freely and speaking more openly as I sit comfortably in my computer chair, sipping my morning coffee, physically much more comfortable and relaxed than I sometimes am when sitting in metal folding chairs in drafty church basements doing face-to-face dreamwork. I can only imagine that this relaxation factor has a positive effect on all the other participants as well. Presumably, we are all comfortably ensconced in our own private, safe, comfy computer chairs, free from the judgment of others and thus more able to think and intuit creatively and sensitively about our own imagined versions of the dreams being considered. </p>

<p>In the virtual dream group, people are free to come and go as their interest and energy dictates, without distracting or giving offence to other participants. By the same token, people are much freer to simply watch and listen and generate their own "aha!"s of insight without participating directly in the process. In the cyberworld, such people are commonly known as 'lurkers', and 'lurking' is a perfectly acceptable activity in this context. </p>

<p>In the virtual dream group, the host has even more influence over the process than in a face-to-face group, since he or she has the power to determine which comments go to the screen for all to read... and which will be 'dumped'. This has both positive and negative implications. All the usual problems of differing levels of sophistication and seriousness among participants that often arise in face-to-face dreamwork still exists in cyberspace but the computer format allows the host to keep people from interrupting one another, or 'hogging' the space with ponderous monologues, as sometimes occurs in face-to-face dream groups. Balanced against this, of course, is the problem of the host's 'countertransference' issues. The unconscious biases and assumptions of the host have even more influence over the productivity of the group process than in face-to-face dreamwork, precisely because the host has so much more influence and control over the flow of communication among the participants. </p>

<p>Albert Einstein was fond of saying that "...if you can't explain what you are doing to an intelligent ten-year-old, you probably don't know what you are doing". This principle of simplifying and clarifying even the most abstruse and emerging intuitive understandings regularly comes into play in computer connected dreamwork. Some of the lyric poetry may be lost in the process but the haiku remains. If you, or anyone you know, is interested in participating in this fascinating new way of exploring the multiple meanings and possibilities of your dreams, here's how you can pull the group up on your screen:</p>

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center">

<p>Log onto <b>AOL</b></p>

<p>Go to Keyword: <b>HUB</b></p>

<p>Choose <b>ENTER</b></p>

<p>Go to <b>CHANNEL ZERO</b></p>

<p>Go to <b>PROGRAM GUIDE</b></p>

<p>Choose <b>DREAM GROUP</b></p>

</div>

<p>The 'dream show' also has a 24-hour bulletin board, where you can leave your dreams, comments and questions at any time. I check the bulletin board regularly for material to work with during the regular daily 'live' dream group.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a "bad dream"-only dreams that sometimes take a dramatically negative form in order to grab our attention. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><h3> 2. Only the dreamer can say with any certainty what meanings his or her dream may have.</h3><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>This certainty usually comes in the form of a wordless "aha!" of recognition. This "aha" is a function of memory, and is the only reliable touchstone of dream work. </p>

<h3> 3. There is no such thing as a dream with only one meaning.</h3>

<p>All dreams and dream images are "overdetermined" and have multiple meanings and layers of significance. </p>

<h3>4. Whenever you are going to say something to someone else about the meanings you see in his/her dream, it is both wise and polite to preface your remarks with words to the effect of "well, if it were my dream..." and to keep this commentary in the first person as much as possible.</h3>

<p>This means that even relatively challenging and confrontative comments can be made in such a way that the dreamer may actually be able to hear and internalize them. It also can become a profound psycho-spiritual discipline-"walking a mile in your neighbor's moccasins." </p>

<h3>5. All dream group participants should agree at the outset to maintain anonymity in all discussions of dream work outside the group, and to respect any and all requests for confidentiality when they arise.</h3>

<p>In the absence of any specific request for confidentiality, group members should be free to discuss their experiences openly outside the group, provided no other dreamer is identifiable in their stories.

    ns1:description """<p>Carl Jung prophesized that the only chance our civilization has for avoiding nuclear holocaust is if enough individuals can stand the tension of opposites in themselves (Hannah, 1981, p.8); if we can, effectively, take responsibility for our dreams and inner lives. To most people living in our extraverted, materialistic father-culture<sup>1</sup> such a notion may sound strange, mad, or simply irrelevant. What powers can we find in our dreams which could help us overcome the dark momentum generated by military and political superstructures - those forces which "wield the powers of darkest hell and shake the land"? (Pearne, 1970) </p>

<p>Before we write off Jung's vision as out-of-touch wishful thinking, let us stay open to the possibility that he may be absolutely right: that taking responsibility for our dreams and our tension toward wholeness moves us in the direction of integration, healing, and a sense of universal connectedness and sacrality. Conversely, repression or denial of our dreamworlds (along with its psychic analogue--the devaluation and invalidation of the feminine universe) moves us toward isolation, fragmentation, devitalization, and violence born of impotence and estrangement. </p>

<p>In writing this article I am responding to a cluster of dream experiences which have been acting upon me for some time. Like water on stone, they have sculpted within me a shape of experience, a set of concerns. These concerns center around my coming to understand the nature of the collective consciousness which seems to be impelling us toward nuclear confrontation. By 'collective consciousness' I am referring to our 'official' story, our authorized, consensual understanding of ourselves and our world. It is the ground of our self justification. It is our collective reality frame which structures our modes of perception and which screens out data which is non-congruent with, or injurious toward, our official reality. It is very difficult to step outside of this frame of reference, yet it seems vital that we find ways of doing so if we hope to restructure the course of world events toward the preservation of our planet. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is only through a change of consciousness that the world will be 'saved'. Everyone must begin with himself. Political action, social work, this 'ism', that 'ology', are incomplete, futile actions unless accompanied by a new and elevated mode of awareness... the true revolution is revelation (White, 1972, p.ix).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe our dreams provide a powerful vehicle of revelation in helping us differentiate from the prevailing collective consciousness. </p>

<p>This paper represents an extended meditation on Jung's prophesy and a sharing of dreams, some personal revelations, which seem to speak to our present political situation. Since dreaming happens within a cultural context, I would like to place my dream experience within this context: I am living in a country which until fairly recently was inhabited and tended primarily by dream cultures who had cultivated dream realities to a degree that we can barely comprehend from our mythically impoverished and nature-depleted viewpoint and experience. In the attempt to systematically destroy these cultures our 'patriarchal culture of conquest' has destroyed much of our inner grounding as well as our capacity for tending and preserving the natural world. I hope to sketch for you the nature of dream consciousness among the Native cultures of this country and trace the loss of this dream grounding after the arrival of white colonizers. This loss involves the oppression of a worldview - a condition of the heart - which we must recover to some degree if we hope to regain our balance with the natural world. It is my hope that we may yet recover sacred ground - inner and outer - which Jung saw as the only hope for our survival.</p>

<p><em>I am writing a book. The first line appears to me: "The red moon hung suspended in the black jungle sky."</em></p>

<p>Several months later I am reading Nor Hall: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are times when only scattered individuals feel the imperative of change and times when the sights of a people are shaped by fear of the end of life as they know it. In such emergency times, symbolized by the reddening of the moon and blackening of the sun (Acts 2), lives take on another charge (1980, p.167). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>There is fear of war in everyone. I meet an old man who is especially tuned-in to war energy. We're on the easternmost edge of the U.S. The beach we play on will be destroyed if war comes. The old man who intuits war is dying. His wife is heartbroken. I hear my daughters playing and laughing in the depths of grandmother's house. They are in rooms beneath the basement. Outside: endless expanse of cornfields. Now I am watching a plane with U.S. as its logo fly very high in steep, rapid ascent. When it reaches its zenith it stalls and crashes to earth in flames. People try to flee the disaster, but few escape. A huge suburban elementary school houses a nuclear reactor. I am in a board meeting with the principal and and inner circle of loyal staff including the principal's brother who runs the reactor. I feel totally out of place here. I'm on a dangerous mission. I need to confront and sabotage the power structure. It's a big lie. The meeting is a patriarchal gathering. After the meeting a few people are invited to dinner with the principal. He calls them "the larger majority." I say jokingly, "I'm not fat enough to belong to the larger group." I have to pass as one of them, but I must subvert them and their nuclear danger. I see expensive desks; I see small children of affluent parents. In spite of their wealth, they're going to be exposed to radiation. It's a crooked, rigged game. Now I'm at one end of a large pipe or tunnel. A large ball of string is run through the pipe at high velocity. I'm to catch it. I'm a workman on this project. I catch it and hold it in place (like a plumb line run horizontally.) A group of people start doing a ritual dance along the string. It's a mechanical, zombie, dead energy movement. I see that the spiritual, artistic, and connective energy is dead here. I have an impulse to do a live-energy dance. I see myself dancing with one of the dead-people with my passion, humor, and consciousness wide open. I know I'd be found out, seen as different, suspicious, dangerous to the social order. I know I'd be harmed. Now I'm writing with an orange and white ball point pen which has come from inside the nuclear reactor. I realize I'm contaminated. It's weird: I can't see or feel it, but I'm in a death field of radiation. I still have to complete my mission: confront the patriarchal nuclear power structure by telling the truth.</em> </p>

<h2>The Dream Crier</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lakota still believe firmly in the efficacy of the vision quest, a ritual fasting and sacrifice through which contact is made with the dream world and the spirit selves of the other realm. -Arthur Amiotte, "Our Other Selves" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the arrival of European explorers and colonizers, what we now call America was inhabited by land and water based dream cultures who had lived here 30,000 years or more and who had developed over 2,000 languages and major dialects - more than existed in Europe and Asia combined at that time (Georgakas, 1973,p.ix). While the cultural diversity of these peoples was enormous, the common thread which characterized their worldviews was a deep respect for and identification with the sacrality of all life. All life-forms (in both the waking and dreaming states of existence) shared equal validity, equal ontological weighting. The prevailing spiritual aesthetic was roundness and union with all life energies. Black Elk, an Oglala Sioux holy man, tells us: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles and everything tries to be round (McLuhan, 1971, p.42). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no distancing nor disidentification with the natural world which characterizes our times and culture.<sup>2</sup> There existed a profound sensitivity to the interconnectedness of all creation: everything moved in circles, all was relative (and relatives) to all else. The psychic and physical ecologies of these peoples were in a state of balance and harmony (which early explorers saw as a state of grace). Every living being-- including life and energy forms which we no longer have the power to see, which we have invalidated in our time--was respected for its consciousness, its sacred energy, which the Iroquois called <em>orenda</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dreams were the main contact between <em>orenda</em> and human understanding. Individuals fasted and prayed in hope of obtaining visions, although an unsought vision was the most valuable. The shamans, who were a combination of doctor and priest, were expected to dream often and to know more than most mortals about the wishes of spirits. In mid-winter a dream festival was held to strengthen <em>teharonhiawagon</em> (the Master of Life) (Georgakas, 1973, p.4). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lakota Sioux called this sacred energy or intentionality, <em>sicun</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All things possess a special power of their own which can be added to, expanded, and utilized to help others and themselves (Amiotte, 1982, p.30).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams and visions were, functionally, the place of sacred energy exchange and infusion among beings, and especially beings from spirit-planes of existence. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zditna-0.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>Tribes such as the Iroquois, Sioux, and Mojave were respected as very powerful dreamers and visionaries. Most of the important daily decision making was premised on dream wisdom and guidance. By midlife, many people could not distinguish between wisdom and experiences gained from the waking world or the dream world (Margolin, 1981, p.117). There existed a seamless union of the two hemispheres of experience. An early explorer and Jesuit priest, Father Jean de Brebeuf, describes (albeit in a condescending manner) the central importance of dreams in the lives of the Hurons: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dream is the oracle that these poor Peoples consult and listen to, the Prophet which predicts to them future events, the Cassandra which warns them of misfortunes that threaten them, the usual Physician in their sickness, the Esculapius and Galen of the whole Country-the most absolute master they have. If a Captain speaks one way and a dream another, the Captain might shout his head off in vain - the dream is first obeyed... The dream often presides in their councils; traffic, fishing, and hunting are undertaken usually under its sanction... They hold nothing so precious that they would not readily deprive themselves of it for the sake of a dream... It prescribes their feasts, their dances, their songs, their games - in a word, the dream does everything and is in truth the principal God of the Hurons (Vogel, 1982, p.21). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This level of dream consciousness was evolved over thousands and ten thousands of years of dream cultivation. In describing the elegance and structure of Mojave dreams, Margolin writes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dreams like this are possible only among a people for whom dreaming was more than a random and uncontrolled activity of the mind; for whom it was an important and well-cultivated art (1981, p.116). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Margolin further notes that in his study of Native Californians, he found that most Native autobiographies</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gave no details about the birth, marriage, or occupation, but instead consisted of meticulous recountings of dreams and contacts with the spirit world (1981, p.7). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreams yield energy-wisdom-truths to the degree that they are cultivated and well received by the dreamer and the culture. Dreaming happens within a cultural context, a worldview, a reality frame. Native cultures and worldviews were woven from dream realities and important dreams were ritually offered to the community where they could be reintegrated into the mythic fabric. A balanced and harmonious relationship with the natural world found its essence and source in the balanced relationship with dream and spirit worlds.<sup>3</sup> In dreams one came to understand the essential connected-sacred nature of all Being and beings. One came into contact with the spirit world and found access to the many planes of existence, from the underworld to the sky world. </p>

<p>Traditionally, the shaman was the strong dreamer. Eliade (1974) calls the shaman the "Technician of the sacred". The shaman's role is to maintain balance for the community and the world by harmonizing him or herself in sacred, ecstatic ways. The shaman has reliable and inspired access to 'big dreams'; the space Jung terms "archetypal" and the time which Eliade calls "illud tempus". The shaman induces ecstatically in him or herself effective and healing reversions to original, cosmogonic time and space - the ground of creation, transformation, and reconstitution. Not only shamans, but each person had access to spirit-visions through his or her dreaming. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every man can cry for a vision, or 'lament': and in the old days we all-men and women-'lamented' all the time (Black Elk, 1971, p.44). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary pipe woman Evelyn Eaton (Mahad'yumi) tells us: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father Sky is the place dreams come from. Over-all the Sky is the power of the Vision and for people on earth the power comes through dreams (1982, p.162). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Native cultures dreaming was not a passive, up.controlled activity; rather, it was approached with the utmost care, preparation, and sacred intention. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term <em>Hanbleceya</em> is usually translated as "crying for a dream". A deeper meaning hidden in the word's roots suggests a standing and enduring. The <em>ceya</em> - crying or suffering-indicates a need for sacrifice... In the process of sacrifice, <em>sacer facere</em>, to make sacred, one is ritually denying the physical existence of the mundane world in order to reach into or experience the sacred world (Amiotte, 1982, p.30). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The degree of humility required for dream 'lamenting' or crying is in proportion to the degree of power one might receive in the vision-dream. Black Elk tells us that we must make ourselves "lower than even the smallest ant" (1971, p.54); that we must realize our own individuality is nothing in relation to the powers of the Great Spirit if we are to prepare successfully for a dream crying. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the chosen day arrives, the young man wears only his buffalo robe, breech cloth, and moccasins, and he goes with his pipe to the tipi of the holy man. Crying as he walks, he enters the lodge and places his right hand on the head of the holy man, saying: "Unshe ma la ye!" (Be merciful to me!) He then lays the pipe in front of the holy man and asks for his help (Black Elk, 1971, p.44). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sacred dream was sought for the good of all people and all life. The dream crier's humility and vulnerability aligned him or her with a sacred mode of awareness and allowed receptivity to the higher good. The dream crier served as a channel for sacred:mythic revelation and spirit-guidance. </p>

<p>The powers for healing, prophesy, spirit travel, and sacred education which Native peoples suffered toward in their dream cryings are relegated by our scientific worldview into the categories of magic, superstition, and paranormal phenomena. These are not highly validated categories of experience in our patriarchal worldview. It is significant that these powers were considered normal and natural by Native peoples. Only in a hypertrophied rational culture are dream and vision potentialities seen as super- or para-normal. They fall outside (or perhaps survive on the border line) of our consensual reality frame. In Native cultures, these powers did not fall outside of natural law; in fact, dream-vision-spirit realms provided grounding and ordering energies for a worldview based on the deep-wisdom perspective of nature. We could say that Native cultures experienced dreaming within a sacred:mythic context. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This capacity of the Native mind to sustain the mythological presence of the transparent world, to integrate sacred time and geography with ordinary time and space, gives rise to a unique view of self in relation to all things and others, including those who dwell in the sacred or 'spirit' world, or as the Australian Natives call it, the "dreaming" (Amiotte, 1982, p.27).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The individual dreamer offered important dreams back to the community where they could serve the common good and renew the mythic ground. Failure to bring important dreams back to the community might result in various forms of what we would call psychogenic illness, or even death. It was recognized that the structure and power of dream reality was much larger than our limited conscious reality, and that a large dream of common import, if kept inside the individual, could cause serious harm. The dream:myth cycle was so vital that "a song or myth was not considered known until it had been properly dreamed" (Margolin, 1981, p.116). Conversely, a dream might reveal a song or mythic insight which would have to be ritually enacted, shaped, and dreamed on by the community. Jung has advised modem Westerners to "dream the myth onward", knowing that myths, like any living thing, are subject to disintegration and decay if not properly tended and inspirited. Native cultures understood their responsibility for tending myths through dream cryings and vision quests. In turn, the myths (the important, collective dreams) nourished and informed the individual's dreams and infused the dreamer with sacred energies - <em>orenda</em>. This was the state of dream consciousness in this country, Turtle Island, when the first white colonizers reached its shores.</p>

  <p>Is can-do coming back? To find out with any accuracy means gauging and quantifying the American mood.

Let it be measured and counted. <em>-Ronald Laing, The Politics of Experience</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When early colonizers reached this land they were often greeted by tribal elders who wept in ritual thanks-giving for a safe delivery. When Columbus reached the shores of the Bahamas (which he mistook for India and accordingly misnamed the Natives 'Indians') he was greeted by Arawak men and women who swam out to meet him. Columbus notes in his journal: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things... they willingly traded everything they owned... They do not bear arms and do not know them... They would make fine servants... With fifty men we could subjugate them and make them do whatever we want (Zinn, 1980, p.1). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first explorers found this land in pristine condition and many believed they had discovered the Garden of Eden or Paradise. Columbus, and the majority of colonizers and slave traders following his example, responded to these gentle and generous people with programs of unbelievable cruelty. Las Casas, a Spanish priest who sailed with Columbus, describes the treatment of the Native people and the land when gold mining was initiated by the conquerers: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... mountains are stripped from top to bottom to top a thousand times ... Thus husbands and wives were together only once every 8 or 10 months and when they met were so exhausted and depressed on both sides... they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them... 7000 children died in 3 months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation... In this way, husbands died in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk and in a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile... was depopulated... My eyes have seen acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write this... (Zinn, 1980, p.6, 7). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zinn assesses Columbus' damage: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In two years, through murder, mutilation, or suicide, half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead. When it became clear that there was no gold left, the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates known as <em>encomiendas</em>. There they were worked at a ferocious pace and died by the thousands. By the year 1515, there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left. By 1550, there were five hundred. A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island (1980, p.4,5). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This atrocity was to play itself over and over again in the course of white expansionism into Native lands, and the desecration of sacred lands and the oppression of Native peoples continue down to this day. Dan Katchongva and other Hopi elders sent (then) President Richard Nixon a letter in 1970. It read, in part: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The white man, through his insensitivity to the way of Nature, has desecrated the face of Mother Earth. The white man's advanced technological capacity has occurred as a result of his lack of regard for the spiritual path and for the way of all living things. The white man's desire for material possessions and power has blinded him to the pain he has caused Mother Earth by his quest for what he calls natural resources... It is said by the Great Spirit that if a gourd of ashes is dropped upon the Earth, that many men will die and that the end of this way of life is near at hand. We interpret this as the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We do not want to see this happen to any place or any nation again... (1973, p.i). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of psychic and spiritual attitude, how does Columbus' genocidal course of action differ from our current leader's plans to 'win' a nuclear war in which millions of people would die instantly while the rest die painfully in an irredeemably devastated world? I would argue that much of the sickness and moral blindness which enables a people to envision, build, and deploy weapons which could destroy all life is an extension of a certain orientation, an archetypal reality frame. This dominant in our collective consciousness has influenced our actions and historical perceptions from Columbus through Vietnam and continues down to our present course of flirtation with 'limited nuclear fights' to be staged on European soil. When asked how we could 'win' a nuclear war, Vice-President Bush replied: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have a survivability of command in control, a survivability of industrial potential, protection of a percentage of your citizens, and you have the capacity to inflict more damage on your opposition than they can inflict on you ... Reporter: You mean like 5% would survive? 2%?... Bush: More than that. If everyone fired everything he had, you'd have more than that survive (cited in Rogers, 1982, p.10). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edwin Meese, advisor to the President, in a speech of March 1, 1982, defined all-out nuclear war as "something less than desirable" (cited in Rogers, 1982, p.10). If the Native worldview is characterized by a deep respect for the sacrality of all life-forms and the preservation of Mother Earth, how do we characterize the worldview of a culture which supports such spokesmen? </p>

<p>I believe we need to recognize which archetypal determinant we are perceiving and acting from as a culture if we are to take steps to bring consciousness to our situation and balance our deep-psyches (individually and collectively) toward life-affirmation. The dominant impulse in Native cultures was toward the preservation of sacred life, and the dominant psychic orientation came from the crying for dreams and visions. The polarity of this worldview - which the white colonizers introduced to this land - is dominated psychically by the archetype of the "unbroken male" (Campbell, 1964). This archetypal dominant constellates a worldview which supports and is supported by male dominance, aggression, and control. In a patriarchal culture, each person, to a greater or lesser degree, participates in upholding and preserving this archetypal force field. The unbroken male is psychically the polar opposite of the shaman or dream crier. The shaman is characterized by his or her initiation through psychic dissolution, dismemberment, and death. It is in this state of brokenness or woundedness that healing dreams and visions visit the initiate and teach powerful lessons from spirit-healing realms. The shaman is the wounded healer who, in turn, heals from his or her own wounds. The unbroken male upholds an attitude of invulnerability, psychic and emotional encasement, and dominance over the environment. The unbroken male will not surrender nor suffer toward feminine wisdom. He does not cry nor lament. </p>

<p>We can describe the shape of consciousness of people living within this archetypal field of experience as extraverted, lacking in-sight, competitive, materialistic, techno-rational, paternalistic-senile, disconnected, exploitative, spiritually depleted, oriented toward accumulation and social power, and violently hostile and repressive toward feminine, nourishing, and internal energies. The unbroken male devalues the Mother, the Earth, dreams, visionary activities, and wisdom of the heart and soul. He molds his body experience around a barrel-chested heart and military spine. Yielding and surrender are seen as signs of weakness and defeat. He equates power with dominance-over rather than sharing-with. Freedom is equated with control. He would like to experience the freedom of total control. He believes in objectivity and that numbers and logic are value-neutral. </p>

<p>His formal way of seeing - the scientific method - is premised on the principles of prediction and control. His psychology measures behavior and excludes 'inner' experience from its formal realm of study. He believes it is possible to have a perception which is not ethically bound to the 'observer'. The 'subjective', felt, dancing world is seen as inferior, heretical, or invalid. Dreams are non-sensical, im-material, foolish. Myth means falsehood. The unbroken male identifies with his machines and with linear progress. He is disconnected from his natural environment. He kills from a distance and his distance kills emotionally. His mode of perceiving the feminine universe is ontological invalidation: trees are seen as timber. The world is drained of divine energy and purpose. He likes to 'cause' submission in others. In his weakened and abstracted state of consciousness he might feel a certain gratification if he were to destroy all life on the planet: he would experience the freedom of total control. If 95% of his people were destroyed in the process, he would still experience a victory of numbers, a survivability of control. </p>

<p>When we look at the world through the eyes of the unbroken male, we see a devitalized, dis-spirited field of objects and numbers which may or may not suit his needs. His "desire-energy" (Bly, 1980) cannot get beyond his own encasement; he cannot connect empathically and compassionately with the natural world, the shared world. This lack of connection may be necessary to maintain his sense of control and dominance, but it also generates a deep impotence, and inability to make any nurturative difference. There seems to be a critical threshold where this gnawing sense of impotence gives rise to violent strikings-out at the world: feeble attempts to make some difference, to make even a fatal connection. The unbroken male is a psychic timebomb. In his refusal to break, surrender or be wounded into openness he breaks everyone and everything in his world. The unbroken male is the 'larger majority' in my dream of nuclear danger. His game is rigged and the children are at stake. lIe is a "false father" (Bly, 1978); his rational insanity is a lie. He upholds a dead-energy mode of existence. He "trembles in fear at the sight of love in the smallest child, the slightest smile, the open hand" (Pearne, 1970). This is the archetypal energy field the white 'conquerers' brought to this land. This is our psychic inheritance. </p>

<p>The final psychological breaking of the dream cultures occurred at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1890 when U.S. government troops slaughtered an encampment of Sioux Ghost Dancers. Black Elk describes the situation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I, to whom so great a vision was given in my youth - you see now a pitiful old man who has done nothing, for the nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead. (Georgakas, 1973, p.112). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the historical context of the breaking of the Sioux Nation, Black Elk is describing the breaking of psychic and spiritual wholeness; the desecration of a world in which the dream and vision mediated sacred energy exchanges of nature and spirit. Without mythic:sacred:dream grounding to inform and vitalize our lives and culture, we lose connection with the natural world and with Spirit. We are left stranded with no deeply cohesive or binding meaning or purpose. We are psychically 'out of place'. If we no longer experience our dreams and inner beings as carriers of sacred intention, then we have also lost our capacity for experiencing and engaging the natural world in a healing and inspirited way. The Earth is no longer protected as our Sacred Mother, we do not listen to stones as they strive toward roundness, protective spirits and guardians of sacred sites depart, unheeded and uncared for. </p>

<p>People cannot live for long without a center, without an adequate experience of sacred meaning or infusion of sacred energies in their lives. Profane existence, as Eliade (1959) points out, is historically bound, while sacred existence is atemporal and participates in cyclical "eternal returns" to sacred time and space. Profane existence lacks sacred intentionality, a celestial archetype, or mythologem within which people can order their lives in a meaningful way. Profane life lacks authentic center, and it can provide no access to origins or sacred grounding. Our current patriarchal, militaristic, senex-culture cannot help us participate deeply in our own being; rather, it orients us toward material gain, exploitation of others and of 'natural resources'. and ego aggression and dominance. This mode of existence is lived from the head, the 'reptile brain', and it keeps us paranoid and bricked-in. In our father-culture the linear-rational is hypertrophied at the expense of the numinous, the warm-blooded connective. The culture of the unbroken male is sedimented in profane existence and will, necessarily, come to an historical end. The Hopi and other native prophesies have foreseen the destruction of profane life and the resurrection of sacred life (the return of the Buffalo). D.H. Lawrence, profoundly touched by the Tewa culture of Taos, New Mexico, shared that vision: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there it is: the newest democracy ousting the oldest religion! And once the oldest religion is ousted, one feels that democracy and all its paraphernalia will collapse, and the oldest religion, which comes down to us from man's pre-war days, will start again... This is an interregnum (cited in Wood, 1976, p.12). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On December 16, 1982 a group of Hopi Elders addressed the U.N. General Assembly "to present the revelations of the Hopi Prophesies and the need for peaceable cooperation and acknowledgement of the importance of dreaming and the inner life on a world-wide basis" (<a href="../@jeremytaylor">Taylor</a>, 1982). The people of the dream have not lost their vital connection with the sacred intention of our world. If we are able, individually and as a culture, to humble ourselves, to find the courage to allow our shame to transform us into compassionate and insightful beings, and to bring sacred intentionality to our worlds--inner and outer-then we may help bring about the preservation of life. The Hopi Elders tell us we must affirm the importance of dreams on a world-wide basis in order to help with this healing. In this way we may help nurture back to life a fresh shoot from the sacred tree of life.</p>

<p>In cultivating our dreamworlds, we turn away from our social masks and our official daytime stories about ourselves and our times. In. turning away from our pretences and shallowness, we generally encounter elements and images of our dark, unknown selves. The tension of opposites which Jung refers to is our ability to recognize and integrate our own darkness, evil, inferiority, and woundedness. This acceptance moves us toward humility, compassion, and forgiveness.on a personal and planetary level. Jung has said that in the projection of our shadow upon the world, we turn the world into a replica of our unseen face. Traditionally, we have projected our shadow selves onto other people, races, cultures, and countries. This is the psychological basis for our ontologically invalidating our enemies: the 'enemy' is our unknown, feared, and hated self. In our emptying our enemies of divine energy and human qualities, we deplete ourselves spiritually and psychically. In killing our enemies we kill the redemptive potential of our own wholeness. Once we have projected 'enemies', it follows that we must destroy them before they can destroy or contaminate our righteous and limited ego-perceptions.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>The beauty of consciousness is that it strives toward integration rather than disintegration. Becoming conscious of our shadow selves by listening to and believing our dreams, puts us in a healing and integrative relationship with our depths, our own souls. To withstand the tension of opposites in ourselves is to re-collect our unconscious, disintegrative projections from the world. In claiming our shadows we also open ourselves to the redemptive light which shines from the darkness, or as Roethke tells it, "The Redeemer comes a dark way." Our shadow, once acknowledged and embraced, brings healing and transformative energies into our lives. In coming to know our dreams we also gain insight into the nature of our collective, cultural shadow. We are granted glimpses of our cultural blind spots and memory-lapses. We come to view our history from the perspectives of the oppressed, forgotten, and disenfranchised. Conversely, when we see and act from our collective shadow, we lose spirit, we make enemies, and finally we destroy others and ourselves rather than break the encasement of our false identities. Jung came to see the collective, cultural shadow of white civilization while visiting the Taos Pueblo in the 1920s: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What we from our point of view call colonization, missions to the heathen, spread of civilization, etc., has another face--the face of a bird of prey seeking with cruel intentness for distant quarry--a face worthy of a race of pirates or highwaymen. All the eagles and other predatory creatures that adorn our coats of arms seen to me apt psychological representations of our true nature (1965, p.248). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The healing, therapeutic value of a person's coming to accept and transform shadow energies is the sine qua non of depth psychology. In the same way we must accept our collective cultural shadow if we are to transform that energy and evolve toward humility and forgiveness on a planetary level. Dreams reveal to us a more complete picture of who we really are. They challenge our fixed perceptions and expand our psychic and spiritual possibilities. </p>

<p>To take responsibility for our dreams is to claim deeply internal authority for our perceptions and actions. By consciously participating in our own dream development and in sharing other people's dreams, we begin to individuate from the perceptual field of the prevailing cultural consciousness. We begin to contact our deeper truths, our soul-truths, and we are shown the mythic patterns which shape our contemporary fields of experience. Campbell (1968) tells us that the mythogenic zone in our present culture must be the individual heart, and Jung and the archetypalists describe the work of depth psychology as "soulmaking". When we recover our dreamworlds to any degree, we recover our capacity for an ensouled and heartful way of life. We recover a ground of compassionate wisdom. When we begin to take our dreams seriously--to let them be as real as they know themselves to be-we begin to participate in a sacred way of seeing. We come into vital, connected relationship with images or spirits who possess their own consciousness and purpose and who bring to us life-sustaining wisdom and empowerment. </p>

<p>The world of dreams is cyclical, spiralling, and round. Our dreams move us toward our mandalic selves. As we move toward wholeness, we identify ourselves as "circles whose center is everywhere; whose circumference is nowhere" (Jung, 1965, p.398). In this movement toward psychic roundness we differentiate from our linear-progressive culture. Dreaming is the psychic balm for our Cartesian wounds. </p>

<p>The recovery of our dreamworlds puts us in attunement with sacred, unbroken energy, and with renewal and hope. The dreamer is the hope-bearer, the gift-bringer. Through our dreams we come to see what is most intimate, significant, and true in ourselves and our culture. Perhaps through our recovery of psychic and spirit dimensions of dreaming we will make warm-blooded connection with deep sources of affirmation, energy, and wisdom rather than continuing our suicidal disconnection with the natural world. </p>

<p>The roots of dreams go deep - beyond our rational understanding or belief systems. World attitudes, like individual attitudes, change only through arational experience: conversion, illumination, revelation, grace. While it is vitally important to initiate and cultivate rational discourse and policy making concerning the nuclear threat, I believe it is equally important for each of us to tap into primal levels of life-desire if we are to reaffirm and revision our future on this planet. We must look 'way down deep' - make ecstatic contact with our oldest and wisest selves - if we hope to free ourselves from the dark momentum of our times and restore the broken hoop to wholeness.</p>

<li><p>This culture transcends national boundaries and represents a reality frame or mode of consciousness which is characterized by estrangement from and hostility towards the natural world. Starhawk describes this consciousness: "Its roots lie in the Bronze Age shift from matrifocal, Earthcentered cultures, whose religions centered around the Goddess and the gods embodied in nature, to patriarchal, urban cultures of conquest, whose gods inspired and supported war" (1982, p.174). </p></li>
<li><p>This sickness of distancing or disconnection constellates an aesthetic of I-it. This generates an attitude of ontological invalidation and psychic and physical violence toward the natural world and natural law. </p></li>
<li><p>Dream and spirit worlds were not 'metaphors' nor 'prescientific' and therefore inadequate understandings of the physical or psychological world; rather, they were ontologically real and vital beyond our current imaginings. </p></li>
<li><p>Shadow projection is, paradoxically, our most dangerous enemy. We see a frightening example of this problem on a national scale in Reagan's recent replacement of the Arms Control and Disarmament Director with an outspoken critic of detente. This led to fear and demoralization within the relatively conservative agency. According to one Foreign Relations Committee member: "Ken (Adelman) sees the Russians as the personification of evil itself, and it's very hard, if you have that view, to negotiate with them" (Denver Post, January 16, 1983, p.19a).</p></li>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Jeremy Taylor was born in Newton, MA and raised in Buffalo, NY. He left home at age 15, going to the Virgin Islands where he learned scuba diving and cabinet making. For many years he was an avid motorcyclist. Jeremy enjoys writing poetry and drawing. He is a radical Unitarian Universalist minister and a community organizer with a deep faith and dedication to his ministry. His wife, Kathy, says that Jeremy is a 24 hour dreamworker. The Taylors live in San Rafael, CA with their daughter, Tristy, age 16. Jeremy is the author of <strong>Dreamwork</strong>, published by Paulist Press.</em> </p>

<p><em>I talked with Jeremy in their home where his wife Kathy joined us. I find it delightful to be in their place. It is so cozy with little nooks and crannies filled with unusual objects collected from around the world. It contains so many treasured volumes that it looks rather like a sanctuary for books.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zdsocm-0.jpg" alt="Jeremy Taylor" width="350" height="auto"/></p>

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Jeremy Taylor</i></div>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> When did you first start out in dreams? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> When Kathy and I were first together, some 27 years ago, we found it helpful and interesting to share our dreams both from a personal point of view-learning about sexism-and from a literary-esthetic point of view (both of us being literature majors). About seven years later, when I came out to California to finish up my alternate service as a conscientious objector, I was part of a project, the purpose of which was overcoming racism. </p>

<p>There was a problem in the project with disaffection among the volunteers. The director asked me if there was anything I could do and I put together a seminar, which backfired. The volunteers supported one another's disaffection. I said, "Let's not tell any more war stories. Let's not even talk about waking life. Let's just tell our dreams, especially those involving racism". </p>

<p>The results were stunning! There was an extraordinary change of tone, withdrawal of projection and the beginning of people starting to deal with one another at a much deeper level of intimacy and general concern. It was a transformative experience for all involved. Others in the program laughed at what we were doing, but the director said, "Look at the results". </p>

<p>That was the first time I let myself have that thought, "look at what we've accomplished here!". I said to myself if looking around blindly in our dreams, without the faintest idea of what we are doing, can do <em>this</em> and begin to impact the deep psychological sources of racism, what else can it do? That was 20 years ago and I have not looked back. In some sense I am still no closer to an answer to that question than when I started. Every time I think I'm getting to some kind of boundary: "Well, dreamwork can do this but it can't do that; I find that, in fact, it <em>can</em> do that. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I've discovered the boundaries always turn out to be personal, beliefs and fears. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes, exactly. I am still a community organizer. I see this dream business as important primarily for its collective significance. It's wonderful all of the personal and individual work that happens when people do dreams, but if that is all that it was about it would be interesting and I would undoubtedly still do it myself, but it would not be the center of my ministry. </p>

<p>That's the thing that separates my work from most of my colleagues who I see as stuck in the ghetto of the personal. I think that's a terrible mistake, but given the nature of our historical circumstances, it is certainly understandable. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> When did you become a minister? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I have only been an ordained minister for nine years. In my denomination the only people who can ordain are the congregation. I taught dream classes at the Starr King Theological Seminary for 11 or 12 years prior to my ordination. The congregation in Berkeley wanted to acknowledge my ministry, legitimize it and honor it, so they ordained me. It was a "back door" way of being ordained and some of my colleagues are not real happy about that, but we get along and I'm in it for the long run. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> So dreams have been one of your tools since you stumbled across it 20 years ago. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes, dreamwork is my primary tool. I've done it in churches, prisons, hospitals, residential treatment centers for adolescent schizophrenics, day care centers, and old folks' homes; you name it. Four or five years into the work I decided that if what I was coming to believe was true, that the dream was in fact universal, and cut across boundaries of age, race, sex and class, it behooved me to seek dramatically different venues for doing the work. </p>

<p>For example I was a <em>HeadStart</em> director for five years and introduced dreamwork into the HeadStart program early on. It even survived a couple of years after my departure. The transformative power of the work is what persuaded the staff. They discovered how much easier it was to teach when the kids were talking about their dreams. They decided, on the grounds of group dynamics alone that it was a good idea. </p>

<p>One of the most important kinds of dreamwork that needs to be done more is with the terminally ill and the aged. I'm doing more and more of that. It's very athletic and demanding work, but their dreams come in a last spurt. Their dreams tend to be poignant and meaningful and this group seems to be particularly ready to receive the gifts from their dreams. </p>

<p>The other kind of venue I've worked in is different cultures. I've done dream work in Canada, England and the Mediterranean cultures. And I've worked with people from many different cultures in this country. Different cultures have different areas of openness and repression. They therefore respond to dreams and dreamwork in different ways. </p>

<p>Dreams are a powerful transformative tool in any culture but it still depends on how the individual views the dream. I think it would be nice sometime to have an ASD conference in Australia since both Australia and New Zealand seem to be very open and receptive to transformation through dreamwork. It would also give us a chance to honor Ann Faraday, who currently lives in Australia, as one of the mothers of the present dream movement. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Where do you see the dream movement presently? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Northern California is the center of the global dream movement. It's not too surprising that the most evolved social structures are here. There's more of a tendency here for dreamworkers to be mutually supportive and operate as a community and less of a traditional competitive business relationship. I see community service and planetary concern as an essential part of being a dreamworker. Self promotion without an element of public service is venal and stupid. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Do you have any suggestions for dreamworkers in promoting their work? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> First you have to make a concerted effort. Secondly, cultivate cultural and institutional connections. Ultimately questions of self promotion boil down to tone setting and self image. Knowing that you can do good dreamwork and help people see the meaning of their life will produce a kind of centeredness and clarity that will attract more people to you than four color posters. It is not a matter of sophistication of promotional technique. It is a question of knowing the depth and value of the work that you are doing. </p>

<p>You have to be ready to do dreamwork or presentations whenever the opportunity arises, whether with an individual or a group, whether you get paid or not. For 15 years I worked at other jobs, but always bringing dreamwork into whatever I did. </p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> People don't understand how hard Jeremy has worked but I've witnessed it from the beginning. He has 24-hours-a-day dedication, doing up to four groups a day and leads workshops almost every weekend. He gives away 10 times as much as anyone else. For the past five years he has been enormously successful, but the previous 15 were give and take. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> One of my problems is that I love the work, so while I'm in the middle of it I do not realize how much energy it has taken. My immediate experience is of being more energized. However, when it ends I crash and realize how little I have left. h has taken 20 years for me to get a handle on how to stay balanced. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I was going to ask you what was hardest about being a dreamworker and that's probably it? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Well, no. For me the hardest thing about being a dreamworker is internalizing other people's pain. It's a particular problem with the style of dreamwork that I do, which is taking each person's dream and making it mine. </p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> When you worked at San Quentin Prison and with Satanic cultists, that was the hardest. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes, and also when I worked with AIDS patients. Part of the irony, from my point of view, is that you're not doing good work unless you're willing to be infected with their misery. The upside is that you get infected with people's creative energies, love and transformation as well. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What has brought you the greatest satisfaction in your work? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> At the moment the most satisfying thing is to have my work affirmed through having my book, Dreamwork, published in German even though they never met me. And of course when I'm doing dreamwork and someone has an "Aha!" of recognition or insight, that moment is the most satisfying thing. But I suppose that the thing I am most pleased about is figuring out that the language of the dream is universal and that everyone is an expert, and finding ways to have people become conscious of that. I am most pleased at forging dreamwork, in the fire of experience, into a community organizing tool that wasn't there before. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> And a lasting tool. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What about dreamworkers and the issue of liability? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> That's one reason I do this as a ministry. What transpires in the course of pastoral counseling is not subject to the same kinds of insane liability that medical model activities are. Personally I also prefer to work with a religious constituency because of the historical precedent for seeing dreams as communing with the Divine. This tends to make people open to the transformative power of dreams. What I do is not therapy. I offer spiritual direction. </p>

<p>The whole religion issue is complicated, but Kirby J. Hensley has done the legal work. You can get an ordination from the Universal Life Church<sup>*</sup> (or other mail order ordinations) by just sending in a small donation. And this ordination has held up in court. My work has shown me that dreamwork is essentially spiritual work. If you believe that in your heart, then Kirby's ordination will be of use. It's a matter of shifting your perception from what looks real to what is real. That is one of the things that dreams are always asking us to do. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Is ordination the only way that a dream worker can protect themselves from liability dangers? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> From a legal point of view the best thing you can do is call it consultation. In California you can't call it therapy without a license. But different states have different laws. As a consultant, the liability issue has to do with fraud and you just have to be clear about what it is that you offer. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> I cast myself in the role of an educator. If there's a complaint, it would be a matter of someone saying they didn't learn anything or it wasn't helpful. I teach an amazing amount of information and experiential exercizes, so I feel there's a minimal risk. </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> And if you run into really troubled people, you can tell them that what they're bringing you is beyond your ability and desire to deal with. Then offer them a list of people or organizations who might be able to help them. I keep a current referral list for that purpose. You can let your fear of liability paralyze you and not do work at all and I don't think that anyone is particularly well served by that. Risks are part of life. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> What does it mean to be a professional dreamworker? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> You don't get to be a professional just because people pay you money, nor by getting licensing and academic degrees. If you're going to use the name "professional" it seems to me you need to be engaged in some kind of social service. Being professional is a matter of the attitude you have toward your work. Are you approaching this work with a sense of spiritual purpose? </p>

<p>Dreamwork is not just psychological, but is psycho-spiritual. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Is this why you changed the character of the Marin Dream Institute? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes. Originally it was the Marin Dream Workshop. We put on two dream festivals in cooperation with the Bay Area Professional Dreamworkers Group. Then we came up with the idea of an institute designed to provide a program in dreamwork leading to certification. We held many meetings and worked on the project for a number of months before we came to the realization that this was not the proper format and gave people the wrong idea. It gave the impression that to become a professional dreamworker you take a training program and get a piece of paper that says you are certified to do dreamwork. </p>

<p>We recognized that offering "festivals" was more in keeping with the true nature of dreamwork. Dream festivals offer the opportunity for more dreamworkers and more members of the public to be involved. The framework is more open and flexible and does not make distinctions between presenters in terms of credentials or experience. The atmosphere is lighter and more fun. It's more of a community event than a school. Every festival is different, a whole new gestalt of individuals and energies. Rather than a fixed program of instruction, the festivals offer exposure to a wide variety of dreamworkers with whom one can study. If an individual wished to become a dreamworker, they would be responsible for creating their program and for determining their own readiness to work with groups or clients. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> Besides festivals, what other future plans do you have? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I have a lot of things cooking. I'm three quarters through writing a book on archetypes entitled <em>Universal Themes in Myth and Dreams</em>. And I have a contract for a mass market book on intellectually responsible dreamwork. I have finished a science fiction novel on planetary survival and dreams. I have a second novel in outline form with a less overt dream focus. I enjoy writing fiction although I don't have much time for it. I'm working for Matthew Fox, a radical Dominican priest, who runs the Institute for Culture and Creation Spirituality in Oakland, CA. I offer several things there: courses on world mythology, pastoral counseling, Jungian psychology and dreamwork. I enjoy very much working with Matthew. </p>

<p>This summer Kathy and I are taking a group of people on a trip to some of the sacred places in Greece where we will explore Greek mythology and dreams. We will return from that trip on July 9. </p>

<p><strong>Jill:</strong> You were a member of a Marin County dreamworker support group some 10 years ago called <em>Coat of Many Colors</em>. Because of that experience and other experiences since then, how do you see such groups relating to the dreamwork movement? </p>

<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> We heard about one another from mutual clients and decided it would be fun to get together. John Van Dam, Ken Keizer and I were the driving force behind the formation of the group. We met weekly in the morning where we supported one another professionally and shared dreams. Some of the other members were George McLaird, <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a>, Bill Schutt, Jeremiah Abrams, Linda Purrington and Barbara Goodrich. Others came and went through the years. We put on two workshops during the time we were together. </p>

<p>This group and others like it can serve to increase cooperation and facilitate cross fertilization. We found it more than fun. It was tremendously supportive and useful. The first Marin Dream Workshop festival was very close to a reunion of the original "Coat" group. The dreamwork movement is a social movement building a society that nurtures diversity. In my view that is the only way worth going. Unless we devise ways of supporting one another the tremendous potential of this movement will be squandered. I hope that doesn't happen. </p>

<p>The following dream is taken from Jeremy Taylor's <em>Nurturing the Creative Impulse</em>, Dream Tree Press, 1982. He cites one of his dreams as an example of humor and problem solving in dreams. </p>

<p><em>Some time ago I dreamed that everywhere I go in the course of my normal business I see a huge block of French cheese standing incongruously in the scene somewhere. I never see the cheese move, but wherever I go, there it is, and I have the feeling I am being "shadowed" by it. Just as I am waking up, I see it again. I ask myself, "What's that doing there?" and immediately an answer pops into my mind with embarrassing clarity.</em> </p>

<p>On one level, there is a visual pun on the phrase "big cheese", a humorous reference to my mildly obsessive desires to be influential, famous and rich. I also realize with a flash of insight that it is a "French" cheese because, as with many varieties of French cheese, it is simply a matter of taste whether people think I have charm and robust character, or simply that I stink. There is a sense in which my big-cheese-ism causes me to project on others, and in that sense it is indeed a "block" to overcome and be transformed.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>*Presented at the twenty-third Annual Meeting of the International Association for the Study of Dreams, July 22, 2006</em></p>

<p>I am going to begin with a parable.</p>

<p>In the current era dreams have come to us as a psychiatric heritage. Mention the word "dream" and two names come to mind, Freud and Jung. In the unique home Freud built for our dream life, the energy source came in the form of the personal unconscious and was located in the basement. Jung came along a bit later and built a quite different style home with a dual energy system in the form of both a personal and a genetically determined collective unconscious. Besides, it was not hidden in the basement but was built into the very obvious facade of the house. These two geniuses took us quite far in explaining the healing potential of the dream. Freud's instinctual theory has been extensively remodeled over time in the direction of a more adaptational model. Jung's home for the dream is still pretty much the way he built it. Both homes provided shelter to people who were in need of it.</p>

<p>Two problems emerged from this architectural parable of our dreams. Both homes were available only to those who mastered the two very different metapsychological keys to the front door. Thus did our dream life become institutionalized. Mastery of design (theory) and maintenance (technique) were essential for those who sought to live there. What was necessary but strange about this was that it became more like a hospital setting rather than a normal home. Dreaming is a universal feature of our existence serving a natural healing function and as such should be universally available. The fact that dreams deal with our emotional life does not relieve us from our individual responsibility to make the best possible use of them. Of course if our emotional life gets too askew we need more than our dreams to regain our balance. By way of analogy, babies came into the world before there were obstetricians. Midwives often sufficed. If there is danger to the mother it's good to have an obstetrician nearby. We are all midwives to the dreamer in group dream work.</p>

<p>The professionalization of our dream life left the public to flounder in its ignorance until fairly recently. In the recent decades professionals and laity joined together to stimulate the public's interest in and knowledge about dreams and how to work with them. The message was that everyone had the energy source to manage their own dream house. Not enough such homes have been built but compared to the situation that existed for most of the last century, there has been a relative real estate boom. Many years ago a book appeared, "Mr. Dowling Builds His Dream House." That's something every human being on this planet can do and perhaps someday will. Only in the last thirty years has a concerted effort been made to return dreams to the people who dream. There are two lessons to be learned from this. Dreams are as helpful to us to the same extent as any other bodily system. The second is that analytic theory is a limited container for our dreams.</p>

<p>Dreaming is characteristic of all mammals. Just as each of our bodily systems serve as maintenance and repair, so do dreams. Their task is to deal with the changing scene in the way we live out our lives. Awake we have a range of authentic and unauthentic emotional responses. Asleep and dreaming we each have an incorruptible core of being that confronts us with who we are rather than who we think we are. It ferrets out the truth as current emotional residues surface in their link to our past (when relevant) in an effort to alert us to predicaments that vary from the mundane to the momentous, from joy to tragedy.</p>

<p>We are better off for discovering the truth about ourselves in any of the four dimensions of our life. In the biological dimension dreams remind us of bodily needs. On occasion, organ pathology appears in a dream before waking awareness. In the psychological dimensions, where most of the subject matter of our dreams comes from, we explore our vices and our virtues. In the social dimension there is both negative and positive fallout from the various "isms" that are swept into our unconscious like sexism, racism, ageism and I might add dreamism, a derogatory attitude toward dreams, prejudging them from the point of view of the waking state as silly, unimportant, or meaningless.</p>

<p>There is a fourth dimension that has no generally agreed upon designation, e.g. transpersonal, cosmic, spiritual. This has to do with the many unanswered questions about our place in a universe not of our own creation. Religion has attempted to fill in this gap but has not had a good track record in uniting us as the single species that we are.</p>

<p>Despite the advances in our psychological study of dreams and the current experimental and observational studies, there are many unanswered questions about the nature of dreaming consciousness. Here are a few of them.</p>

<p><em>Where does the inexorable honesty of our dreams come from? It is as if we have a magic camera with an ethical aperture that opens wider while dreaming than in the waking state.</em></p>

<p><em>What is the source of the creativity that shapes very original imagistic metaphors in our dreams that embed our true feelings and do so in a way that is oblivious of time, space and causality?</em></p>

<p><em>What is it that so instantaneously links our remote past memories in their relevance to the current source of feelings that instigated the dream, something we can't do consciously?</em></p>

<p><em>Where do the occasional "big" dreams come from that Jung referred to with imagery that evoke feelings far beyond our ordinary range?</em></p>

<p><em>Why do paranormal events such as telepathy occur more often in dreams than in waking life?</em></p>

<p><em>Why are we more acutely aware of all four dimensions of our life while dreaming than awake?</em></p>

<p>In seeking answers to these questions I have sought help beyond my own field of psychiatry. The last ten years of the twentieth century was known as the "decade of consciousness." Quantum physicists, in concert with many other disciplines, began to focus on "the hard problem" (Chalmers, 1995), namely, the connection of consciousness to its underlying neurophysiological substrate. With only few exceptions, however (Wolf, 1994; Walker, 2000; Eccles, 1953), the focus was exclusively on waking consciousness. Quantum theory was so successful in the light it shed on all its applications to the world of matter, perhaps it could bring us closer to an understanding of the relationship of mind to matter. The problem was that no one understood the strange features that came with it. These included its indeterminism, the wave-particle duality, the jump an electron makes in going from one orbit to another without being in between, the measurement problem where all aspects of the experiment including the observer influence on the end result, and finally the reality of the impossible, namely non-locality, where a signal goes faster than light.</p>

<p>There was something about these puzzling features of quantum theory that suggested an analogy to the nature of dreaming consciousness. My comments will be limited to complementarity, the contextual linkage of the observer and the observed, non-locality and interconnectedness.</p>

<h2>Complementarity</h2>

<p>Bohr (1961) sounded a clarion call when he wrote of the relevance of the general concept of complementarity to quantum mechanics and how it might apply to disciplines other than physics, including the life sciences and the mind itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The use of apparently contrasting attributes referring to equally important aspects of the human mind present indeed a remarkable analogy to the situation in atomic physics, where complementary phenomena for their definition require different elementary concepts. (p. 77)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not know what an electron is when it is not being measured. What we do know is that it has a dual nature depending on how we go about measuring it. Under one set of circumstances it becomes manifest as a particle. Under another set of circumstances it appears as a wave. This hidden unity of opposites is known as complementarity. It is also an apt term to describe the dual nature of consciousness. Awake we are in the particle mode facing a world of discrete objects. Asleep and dreaming we are coping with the internal resonant wave-like feelings seeking to embed themselves in symbolic imagery. Both states, while experienced in qualitatively different ways, are derivative of a unity. They are complementary. Both are necessary for a complete description of the individual. To the extent that one is in focus the other is not.</p>

<p>More specifically, the two different forms of consciousness reflect the unique and paradoxical predicament we are in. We are one with the material fabric of the world and at the same time capable of observing that world, reflecting on it and interacting with it. Awake we function in a world characterized by its discreteness and patterning. Asleep and dreaming we shift to a more diffuse imagistic portrayal of residual feeling tones. Awake, the feeling tones that later surface in dreaming consciousness are dimly felt in a manner akin to a Greek chorus. The latter registers the background dissonance between a particular conscious response to a given experience and the seeming unawareness of its actual felt impact. Asleep and dreaming there is a figure-ground reversal highlighting the feelings involved while the waking ego is assigned to a more reactive role.</p>

<h2>The Observer and the Observed</h2>

<p>Quantum mechanics has brought to the fore the interrelatedness of the observer to the phenomena under observation. This is known as the "measurement problem" and is still a very mysterious aspect of quantum theory. We become, as Wheeler has noted, participatory observers in the world around us. The quantum features of an experiment are determined by all the aspects of the experiment including input from the observer in determining the end-result. There is something quite analogous to this when we are dreaming. Awake our observing egos, taking our discreteness as a given, interact in ways that are at times coherent with the underlying reality of our situation and at times are not. By this I mean we are either emotionally engaged or not. Asleep and dreaming there is a radical shift in the observer role. The reality that now comes into view is spontaneous and unsummoned. We remain an observer but are now observing a scenario not of our own conscious making. It is as if the dreamer experiences herself at the onset of a dream as a member of an audience in a theater witnessing a drama about to ensue as the curtain goes up. She has no awareness that she herself has written the drama about to unfold, cast the characters, arranged the props, and reacts to what is going on on the stage as a novel experience.</p>

<p>There is, in effect, an actual merging of the observer and the observed as the dream context unfolds. Freed of temporal and spatial constraints, having a causality of its own, the feeling residues of the waking context come into full view in a metaphorical narrative. By changing our focus asleep we change the "measurement" arrangement and arrive at different views of a unitary entity.</p>

<h2>Non-Locality</h2>

<p>The term non-locality refers to the instantaneous transfer of a signal from one place to another through no known physical means. Non-locality at the quantum level has been subject to experimental proof but still remains a baffling mystery. Non-locality at the macro-level, as cited in dreams, has been supported by the experimental work in parapsychology and also remains a quite mysterious happening. Whether we are catching glimpses of one mystery or two different ones remains to be determined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My own interest in telepathy began in the course of psychoanalytic practice when a patient of mine would report a dream containing striking and non-inferential information of concordant events in my own life. This eventually led to experimentally controlled studies using the REM sleep-monitoring technique resulting in statistically significant findings with regard to both the occurrence of telepathic and precognitive dreaming (Ullman, <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Krippner</a>, Vaughan, 2002).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do strange things with time and space in our dreams as we impress them into metaphorical service. In the case of time the instantaneous condensation of past and present might be looked upon as a kind of subjective non-locality. The paranormal dream, on the other hand, suggests the possibility of an objective non-locality by spanning across space in the telepathic dream and across time in the precognitive dream. The information picked up is literally or symbolically depicted in the dream. At an anecdotal level Louisa E. Rhine (1961) noted that dreaming seems to favor the occurrence of telepathy over waking consciousness.</p>

<h2>Interconnectedness</h2>

<p>Here there are three strands that seem to fit together, if only by analogy. The first is the assumption that quantum connectedness applies to the universe as a whole. This view has gained support with the experimental proof of the general acceptance of non-locality as a basic feature of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The second is the view of Barlow (1980) who wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Consciousness is not a property of a brain in isolation but is a property of a brain that is and has been in communication with other brains.... I shall suggest that consciousness ... is Nature's method of making humans behave cooperatively."</em> (p. 82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies and I believe correctly that consciousness, awake or dreaming, is contextual in nature and that we lose sight of this in our assumption that it is our unique gift to do with as we want. Awake the capacity to love is the most coherent way of relating to a given context. When that capacity is impaired, efforts at healing are set in motion in a way similar to the efforts at repair when a bodily system is damaged in any way. It is in this sense also that dreaming consciousness as a natural healing system exposes impediments to connectedness and explores the coping resources available. Just as we are not in control of our own natural healing potential in response to trauma, infection or other sources of impairment, dreaming is an unconscious effort at healing in the realm of feelings, biologically enforced and spontaneously set in motion. Dreams shed light on unresolved tensions and in so doing pave the way to a truer sense of connection to one's past and to others in the present. Awake we are the beneficiaries of a biological adaptive mechanism that arose in connection with sleep. Once dream content became oriented to social existence in the human sense, the value of that content found its way into waking life. A prime example is the way preliterate societies have made use of their dreams (Eggan, 1949).</p>

<h2>Towards a New Abode</h2>

<p>What kind of a home is needed for that very special entity known as the dream? As the parable continues, the needs of that occupant are briefly summarized.</p>

<ol>

<li>The dream needs an abode that is safe, warm and supportive regardless of the emotional weather outside where we encounter the occasional "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."

</li>

<li>Like all our organ systems, it is a functional system operating in its own way. In this sense it is part of an extended family that at times visits this house because of functional needs such as the need to urinate. In a recent dream of mine I was building my own water supply system. I caught on and managed to get to the bathroom in time. There are times when a particular organ gets into trouble and it may move into the dreamer's house until recognized and the needed help arrives.

</li>

<li>In this new house there has to be sufficient space to accommodate the special furnishings of the dreamer. These include the following:

Creativity: Dreaming, in a sense, is a very personal art form. Our waking life is full of dead metaphors. "Full" is used metaphorically as its concrete meaning has to do with volume. "Dead" is used as a metaphor as its ordinary reference is to actual death (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Dreams, as the major occupant of the house, spend a good part of the night churning out brand new metaphors.

<p>

<b><i>Memory:</i></b> The dream has the key that opens up our remote memory bank and links relevant memory to its role in the dream. Waking consciousness does not have the key. The dream connects us to the personal past and orients us to the social future.

</p>

<p>

<b><i>Imagination:</i></b> This is a remarkable aspect of the dream that is called upon for the manufacture of metaphors. It is the source of their uniqueness.

</p>

<p>

<b><i>Honesty:</i></b>This is the most important tool the dreamer has. It is concerned with house maintenance and repairs. It does this by ferreting out flaws in the structure. Honesty connects. Dishonesty disconnects. Life is full of traps for the unwary that lead at times to expediency instead of authenticity.<sup>1</sup>

</p>

</li>

<li>The dream has an extended family who also inhabit the abode and contribute toward its maintenance. They come from different regions already noted -- the biological, the psychological, the social and the fourth or cosmic dimension.

</li>

</ol>

<p>The parable ends here.</p>

<p>The new abode owes its origins to the work of a distinguished theoretical physicist, the late David Bohm. I want to say in advance I cannot, in this presentation, do justice to the range and depth of his argument in setting forth a new theory of the nature and origin of matter. Nor can I ask him to shoulder any responsibility to the way I have applied it to the origin of our dreams. In my personal meetings and in his writings, he has never, as far as I know, referred to dreams or dreaming.</p>

<p>My interest in the possible relevance of quantum theory to dreaming was awakened in 1974 when I had the good fortune of attending a week long dialogue between David Bohm and Krishnamurti. Twenty-three years before this meeting Bohm wrote what was and still is a classic text on quantum theory. There was an interesting sequel to this book. He wrote it to deepen his own understanding of quantum mechanics but instead it left him with the feeling that a major shift in perspective was needed to go beyond the mysterious gaps in the then and still current Copenhagen indeterministic view of quantum theory. His scientific curiosity was also fueled by his sensitivity to and deep concern with the level of fragmentation that exists among the peoples of this earth and the precarious state we have arrived at in our current efforts of civilizing ourselves. Encouraged by Einstein and Pauli, Bohm began to move in two directions at the same time. He developed an algebra to resolve the anomalies of quantum theory and a metaphysics that addressed the origin of matter and ultimately the source of the generalized fragmentation (Bohm, 1980). Bohm posed the need for a new order to supersede quantum theory just as the latter superseded, but included, the Newtonian order.</p>

<p>Bohm set forth a fundamental order, the implicate order, an order of wholeness that included all that exists and does so in a state of interconnectedness. It is structured holographically, the entirety manifest at every point. Bohm preferred the term holomovement to emphasize that it is a generative order in flux. This order of what he refers to as enfolded wholeness is not only the source but also the maintenance of all that exists. All matter unfolds out of the implicate order to form the explicate or unfolded order in a continuous equilibrium of enfoldment and unfoldment.</p>

<p>The contents of the implicate order no longer exist as discrete elements. They retain their individuality but not in the form experienced in waking life. They exist in a form that reflects their intimate contact with the whole. An analogy would be of a flowing stream where all the fundamental elements of the stream are in contact with all others. There is a continuous and sustaining exchange between these two orders. All matter in this sense is regarded by Bohm as temporary abstractions from the implicate order. He cites as an example of this what is known as a standing wave. In a flowing body of water interacting eddies may throw up a wave that appears to be stationary but exists only as long as the eddies support it. In a sense we are all standing waves existing as apparent entities that sooner or later fall back into the underlying matrix, the implicate order from which we came.</p>

<p>What now follows is an exploration of the possible relevance of Bohm's work to a deeper understanding of the nature of dreaming.</p>

<p>In the beginning there was Freud. Whether you agree with his metapsychology or not, he realized the importance of an unconscious domain that made itself felt mainly through our dreams. Then came Jung along with a broad interest in other fields such as psychic phenomena and quantum physics. He enlarged the unconscious to include inherited archetypes. We now had a collective unconscious in addition to a personal one. The unconscious was safely ensconced in the new profession of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>Then came Bohm who worked out an overarching metaphysics that addressed the basic issue of wholeness and fragmentation. What I am focussing on from the point of view of dreaming is that in the implicate order all matter, inorganic, organic, sentient, exist in their interconnectivity. If we were to consider the implicate order as a Universal Unconscious, what would it contribute to our understanding of the nature of dreaming? Broadening the unconscious in this way extends dreaming to a much wider range of content than we usually consider. Dreams point outward<sup>2</sup> as well as inward. This would include events usually considered outside the range of our dreams such as the cataclysms of nature as well as telepathic and precognitive dreams. In short, Bohm's implicate order, considered as a Universal Unconscious, links us more authentically not only to ourselves but to all forms of matter.</p>

<p>Just as we described standing waves as formed and maintained by an invisible energy source giving it the appearance of permanence, so are we. We are all standing waves existing as temporary entities that sooner or later fall back into the underlying matrix, the implicate order from which we came. Just as standing waves can be buffeted about in the ocean by outside forces that may impinge upon it, we are buffeted about by social and material forces that impact us. Depending on the nature of those forces they can deepen or limit that sense of connectivity with others and with our environment that is our heritage from the implicate order. To the extent we honor that gift of connectivity to others and to our environment we end up as either saints or sinners or somewhere in between. At one extreme is that rare occurrence of cosmic consciousness where the individual feels profoundly connected to all that exists if for only a fleeting moment. It is as if the individual catches a glimpse of the implicate order while in the explicate order.</p>

<p>Bohm's approach to wholeness in the framework of the implicate and explicate orders suggests a more felicitous appreciation of the role our dreams play in our life. Dreaming consciousness is situated between the two orders. As such it could be considered as a relay-station with input from both orders. The contributions from the implicate order would include the capacity to open up our remote memory bank, the freedom from space and time, contiguity based on feelings rather than the logic of waking life, the wide range of imagination and memory, a prevailing quality of truthfulness and finally the creative energy of the implicate order (Bohm refers to it as generativity) prepare this remarkable brew for the dreamer.</p>

<p>The dream acts as a relay station receiving input from both orders. What does it need from the explicate order? Dream content itself is triggered by recent residual feelings that have been stirred up and not yet resolved. Those feelings include what Freud referred to as the day residue. I prefer to include a larger time span which I refer to as enduring emotional residues that evolved over days or even weeks before the dream. What the dream needs from the implicate order are the remote memory sources of the current issues and the creative dynamic that characterizes the holomovement. The feeling tones then find their way into the dream.</p>

<p>As a relay station between the two orders dreaming enriches both Bohmian orders. It makes its own unique contribution to the implicate order, just as any other experience does and it makes its contribution to the explicate order by infusing it with a bit more honesty and authenticity. The dream presents a fresh supply of authentic feelings, the true source of our connective tissue. Inauthentic feelings maintain disconnection. Authentic feelings do not let our ego get in the way. They serve to save ourselves from ourselves when we need to.</p>

<p>Dreaming consciousness thus integrates input from the implicate order making it available to the explicate order. In its unfoldment from the implicate order it may be regarded as explicate to that order. As it, in turn, unfolds its message to the explicate order it may be regarded as implicate to that order. This form of consciousness has its own unique language made up of feelings embedded in metaphorical imagery and arranged in narrative form. In its development differs from the logical causality of waking life in that it evolves by feelings generated by the successive transformations of the metaphorical imagery. This projectory follows a dialectic path much as a playwright hints at the theme in the first act followed by a second act which develops the source of the tensions initiated, followed by a third act, conveying the way the tensions have been resolved. For the dreamer the extent to which the tensions are resolved are, of course, dependent on the inner resources available at the time they are occurring.</p>

<p>The dream is a creature of the night and may or may not readily find its place in the explicate order. If interested, we find that place in our own way. It's in the order of a dream, if remembered, for the dream to be socialized to fully communicate what it has to say. The form this socialization has taken, and properly so, is the experiential dream group. Such groups have been organized in various ways. My own groups are atheoretic, following the dream as the only guide necessary to fully disclose the dreamer's predicament at the time it occurred. Eschewing a priori theoretical formulations the members of the group, including the leader, are all midwives creating the conditions for the safe delivery of the dreamer's own personal creation -- the dream. Self-disclosure is the analogy to labor pains prior to the end result justifies the means. The baby's first cry gets a new life going; the dreamer's "aha" has the same effect. The dream has found its rightful place in the world.</p>

<p>We do have to learn a new language to reap these benefits but that is not so bad. We all learned the language of metaphors in grade school when we committed our first poem to memory. The poet rearranges words to express feelings. The dreamer rearranges imagery to tell a story.</p>

<p>I began with a parable and I'm going to end with one. The dreamer who lives in this new abode gets up in the morning, leaves his new abode and goes to work with his dream safely ensconced in his briefcase. His workplace is a very unusual building. It's a building in progress. It is a skyscraper<sup>3</sup> with no roof leaving room for a limitless supply of additional "stories." The interior is also unusual. There are no private offices for CEO's, managers, etc. There are only large rooms which can accommodate a small group. The chairs are arranged in a circle. One briefcase is opened and dream work begins in a process controlled by the dreamer.</p>

<p>Four banners are draped over the facade of the building.</p>

<p>The first was designed by Sigmund Freud. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"The dream is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious attributes of the mind."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second was designed by Carl Gustav Jung. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"So flower-like in its candor and veracity that it puts us to shame for the deceitfulness of our lives."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third is from the abstract impressionist artist Robert Motherwell. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Oppression in art, as in life, is when the conclusion to be reached is predetermined by inner or outer a priori notions of how art ought to be."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fourth is a somewhat changed rendering from a well-known call to arms by Karl Marx in the nineteenth century. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Dreamers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your theories."</em></p>
</blockquote>

    ns1:description """<p>A hundred years from now our future ‘ancestors’ will look back to appraise, hopefully with compassion, what we have contributed to the evolution of human consciousness. By then, dreams will be such an integral aspect of life that this time in the history of the dream movement will be seen as the crucial step in the development of a global dream awareness. Every new discovery made in the field of dream education and research is a stepping stone creating a path which opens to the vast dimensions and potential of our dreaming mind which leads to the advancement of our human consciousness. </p>

<p>For this particular issue of Dream Network, I was asked to share my involvement in the dream movement, in particular how I came to establish the Dream Study Program at John F. Kennedy University in California. The program is a pioneering graduate program that explores a holistic approach to understanding and working with dreams. It examines the importance of dreams in science, psychology, mythology, shamanism and art and has three concentrations: Education, Consulting and Art. The growing program includes graduate students from various disciplines who are all interested in incorporating dreams into their various professional fields. </p>

<p>My involvement in the dream movement began in the early 80s. I was fortunate to mentor with Daniel Kortenkamp, at the University of Wisconsin, who was one of the very few professors teaching consciousness, parapsychology and dreams at the undergraduate level. He handed me any new publications on dreams including the first issue of <em>Dream Network</em>. From those early publications one could feel the excitement which was hovering in the air. A great magnet was pulling researchers, therapists, educators and artists together to exchange ideas about dreaming. Dreams were a special attraction that bonded people together. In those early days, dream conferences or meetings were like a family reunion. </p>

<p>The first conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) in San Francisco in 1984 not only brought together the scholarly investigation of dreams, but also built a supportive community that has been going strong for 20 years. At the time, I was investigating the scientific and psychological aspects of dreaming as part of my studies, but as an artist, I was also exploring dreams through a different eye. Since the arts were not represented at ASD, I took on the vision of bringing the arts to this developing movement. To researchers and psychologists, it was not immediately obvious that art was a valid and deep way of knowing particularly in relation to dreaming. Scientific investigation is often emphasized as the predominant mode of inquiry in consciousness studies, however, I felt the arts also had an equal place at the foreground in the dream movement as an essential vehicle for exploring the dreaming mind. </p>

<p>This conviction resulted in fifteen years of supporting the arts by instigating the ASD arts committee in 1988; by co-founding Dream Creations (1990) and facilitating the first Bay Area dream artists meeting (1994) all of which have been going strong ever since. </p>

<p>While I engaged with this work in support of the arts, I was also finishing my doctorate degree researching and writing on lucid dreaming and modern art. No matter how supportive the various institutions I had studied and thought at were, I saw a great need for a full-fledged interdisciplinary dream studies program. In the early 90’s I had established an interdisciplinary training program in dreams and offered courses in private practice in my newly established Dream Creation Center in San Francisco. I was also travelling to other centers giving workshops and retreats on Dream Creation Method. Although the teachings were successful and the method was very effective, I wanted to spend my energy developing something more long lasting that could make an impact in the field. I was ambivalent toward establishing a training program of my own so I put out a prayer for being in a receptive academic institution in which I could develop a dream studies program. At the time there were no accredited graduate level university interdisciplinary programs on dreaming, the study of dreams was often folded into the field of psychology. </p>

<p>In 1995, I accepted an associate professor appointment at John F. Kennedy University (JFKU) in the Graduate School of Holistic Studies. In my interview for the position I announced my vision up-front: I let them know that I was interested in developing this program and the Dean of the School was very supportive. Of course I had gained the trust of the institution for six years as an adjunct faculty, teaching many courses on psychology, dreams and art. But creating a new program with no history was certainly challenging. I felt they also made a commitment to support me all the way. At this time, I closed my private practice and put all my energy into the creation of the dream studies program. </p>

<p>The proposal for the dream studies program took several months to develop. I’ll never forget what went through my mind while walking to the Academic Standards meeting with the dream studies proposal in my hand. What could I say to defend dreams in an academic setting? How could I convince the faculty and the chairs of different departments that dreams belong to interdisciplinary studies? How would I voice the importance of this field so that we could defend it with our accreditation Board? How would I take the step toward making dream studies a field amongst the other established disciplines? I had a major task at hand and my only guide and support was my strong conviction that dream awareness is one of the essential steps to discovering our full potential as human beings and its study was essential in the development of human consciousness. Perhaps it was because I felt indebted to the dreaming world for saving my life and bringing so many gifts to it. Perhaps it was having observed the constant transformation that dreams brought to the lives of my students and clients. Perhaps I was guided by the “future ancestors” who were holding my hands to move forward, to lay the groundwork, one stone at the time. I knew for certain that the intention for creating this program had a much larger implication than my own personal agenda. For that matter, I felt humble and held in a very loving and beautiful space. There was no doubt in my mind and I walked in with absolute certainty. </p>

<p>I was drilled with one question after another. But the major concern was that dreams seem to belong to the field of psychology and therefore should be offered under psychology, yet I was determined that dreams belonged to interdisciplinary studies. To me dreams belong to every discipline. We all dream, therefore dreaming benefits everyone and in every field. Although my professional training was in psychology, I saw dreams belonging to a larger field of study. What assisted my argument was my perspective and education from having been at the ASD conferences since their inception and observing the diversity of discourse and inquiry into the field. Dreams are studied and practiced in a variety of disciplines such as religion, anthropology, cognitive science, psychology and the arts. </p>

<p>Developing a program in an academic institution is not an easy task. Every step towards the creation of this program had to go through several committees to be approved. This process can take months or sometimes years. I spoke often with Mena Potts at the Union Graduate School about the development of their Ph.D. program on dreams. To have her program was a great support while at the same time I was proposing an onsite (classroom) program that had different implications. </p>

<p>The development of this program had an organic beginning, at first offering one course on dreams — “Theory and Practice of Dreams” in 1989 — and then growing as I proposed other courses on dreams. The program first began as a concentration within the Department of Interdisciplinary Consciousness in 1996 and then became an independent program in the fall of 2000. To keep the interdisciplinary nature of the program, core courses on dreams were developed with different tracks under the programs in integral psychology, consciousness studies, holistic health and art. Therefore the certificate program’s 36 units is cognitively, experientially and experimentally oriented and has a holistic model of viewing, and working with dreams. </p>

<p>One of the major aspects of developing an educational program within an accredited institution is the creation of a solid professional library. Knowing the importance of this pillar I began working on the library collection when I taught the first course at JFKU in 1989. At that time, they had only a handful of books on dreams whereas they now have one of the most extensive collections of books and journals on dreams. </p>

<p>I believe this program is the first graduate “in-class” program in an accredited academic institution. The implication of this program and hopefully other programs in establishing the field dreams is crucial. Such a program is advancing the field very rapidly as students are beginning to bridge and integrate different disciplines and write very creative and inspiring research papers. Although research and writing on dreams have been prolific since the mid 80’s there is still so much ground-breaking research yet to be done. The excitement of creating a dream program is to see the development of a dream culture. I have witnessed incredibly rich and vibrant dialogues among the students and faculty. Students have been forming dream groups, doing collaborative research projects, having in-depth exchanges of ideas and have much excitement about brining dream education into the world. The dream studies students come from varied fields of study such as business, psychology, education, health, politics, art and consciousness and aspire to bring dreaming into their fields in order to advance them. Some students have continued on to do doctoral work, while others are teaching in colleges and have private dream work practices. Students in the art track are creating incredible interactive dream exhibitions which include creations from dreams while at the same time work to articulate the process of creation. </p>

<p>For me, the most meaningful part of this development has been to witness each student’s major life transformations as they go through the program and to see the harmonious community being created by having one common interest: dreams. The program has already hosted two major ASD regional conferences with students as volunteers and presenters; we also invited our local Bay Area Dream Group (BADG) to have an exchange of ideas and have field trip to the Novato Dream Library and Archives. </p>

<p>As for the dream movement... we have seen so many movements come and go. People go through phases of being interested in a topic, but the dream movement is here to stay as it has always been since ancient times. The difference at this time in history is that dream awareness is crawling into all different walks of lives and is demanding our attention by connecting us together. More and more people will discover that dreaming is an important and integral aspect of their lives and I know that more academic institutions will become open to acknowledge dream studies as a valid and important discipline in their educational systems. </p>

<p>As students of dream studies graduate, we will see more courses taught at colleges and high schools and we will see the creation of more dream centers all over the world. These centers will help bring about a world where: dreaming is discussed regularly at the breakfast table with our families and friends; the wisdom of the ancient cultures, who have for un-known centuries utilized dreams for spiritual guidance and healing, is acknowledged; dreams are used regularly for problem-solving in many fields. Working with dreams is changing our culture by educating us to think metaphorically, by helping us learn to work through our inner conflicts and bring the gift of creativity into our everyday lives. Dream awareness brings hope for our future and gives us a chance to live in a harmonious world. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>For many centuries, Western investigators had little respect or regard for native healing systems. In recent years, however, such prominent psychotherapists as Jeanne Achterberg (1985), E.F. Torrey (1986), and J.D. Frank (Frank &amp; Frank, 1991) have found many native healing systems to be extremely sophisticated and to contain elements that can be instructive for Western practitioners, e.g., the use of imagination and altered states of consciousness for health and personal growth.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-0.jpg" alt="Stanley Krippner" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>I have compared the healing models of several native healing traditions with those of allopathic medicine, finding both similarities and differences (Krippner &amp; Welch, 1992). Intending to do the same for dreamworking systems, I located a model proposed by Ullman and Zimmerman (1979) that compared three Western systems, those of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>. I added two facets to the model, and revised several others to provide a better basis for cross- cultural comparison. The resulting 10-facet model still was useful in comparing the systems of Freud, Jung, and Ullman:</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfacet-1.jpg" alt="Montague Ullman" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<h3>1. What is the function of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Freud: To discharge repressed instinctual responses.</p>

<p>B. Jung: To disclose unacknowledged aspects of the self.</p>

<p>C. Ullman: To serve as an adaptive form of consciousness during sleep.</p>

<h3>2. What motivates people to recall their dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Freud: People often try not to recall dreams because they contain repressed material, but in psychoanalysis, the dream is the "royal road to the unconscious" and helps people to understand their personal psychodynamics, e.g., the role of wish fulfillment in dreams.</p>

<p>B. Jung: By recalling dreams, people can work toward individuation, e.g., by understanding how, in dreams, they compensate for the undeveloped parts of their psyche.</p>

<p>C. Ullman: Through dream recall, dreamers can become aware of their waking life predicament and their feelings about it.</p>

<h3>3. What is the source of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains repressed desires.</p>

<p>B. Dreams come from the unconscious, which contains the undeveloped aspects of the psyche.</p>

<p>C. Dreams come from the unconscious, which consists of material that dreamers ignore or repress.</p>

<h3>4. What is the language of dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>

<p>B. Imagery is the language of the unconscious and of dreams.</p>

<p>C. Imagery is a vehicle for expressing dream content and feeling as visual metaphors.</p>

<h3>5. Are dream symbols universal?</h3>

<p>A. Sexual symbols occur, in various forms, in all cultures.</p>

<p>B. Archetypal symbols are universal, personal symbols are not.</p>

<p>C. There are no universal symbols; dream imagery is rooted in one's daily experience and in one's culture.</p>

<h3>6. What is the role of one's current life situation in dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Day residue touches off memories of an earlier conflict.</p>

<p>B. Day residue opens up undeveloped parts of the psyche.</p>

<p>C. Day residue opens up issues not attended to while awake.</p>

<h3>7. What techniques are used to work with dreams?</h3>

<p>A. Free association is used in dream working.</p>

<p>B. Free association and amplification are used in dreamworking.</p>

<p>C. Dreamworking assesses dream metaphors through the exploration of the associative context.</p>

<h3>8. What is the role of the dream worker?</h3>

<p>A. Psychoanalysts tell dreamers their dreams' meanings.</p>

<p>B. Psychotherapists function as guides.</p>

<p>C. Psychotherapists and other dreamworkers function as guides but the dreamer is the final felt authority regarding the dream's meaning.</p>

<h3>9. What role do dreams play in the culture?</h3>

<p>A. Dreams reflect a culture's repressed material.</p>

<p>B. Dreams reflect a culture's mythic archetypes.</p>

<p>C. Dreams are socially grounded in the culture and reflect unsolved social as well as personal issues.</p>

<h3>1O. How are anomalous dreams viewed?</h3>

<p>A. Anomalous dreams are subject to the same psychodynamics as other dreams.</p>

<p>B. Anomalous dreams reflect archetypal material and synchronicities.</p>

<p>C. Anomalous dreams are valuable resources, e.g., in understanding emotional interactions.</p>

<p>When doing archival or field research with indigenous groups, this modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used to advantage. However, it is important to try to differentiate "function" and "motive." The "function" of the dream might be conceptualized as adaptive (e.g., to assist the myelinization of nerve cells, to develop the eyes' binocularity) or informational (e.g., to assist in problem-solving, to bring new information to the dreamer). The "motive" to recall one's dreams might be to find game during the hunt, to make contact with deceased relatives, or to receive direction as to one's vocation.</p>

<p>"Function" refers to the operation of the total human organism within a given historical and geographical contex t, while "motive" refers to more specific personal and community goals. Ofien there will be more than one function and more than one motive. In addition, there might be a {natural} function of dreaming (e.g., vigilance during the night) and an overlaid function (e.g., humans have learned to use dreams as natural healing mechanisms).</p>

<p>In identifying the source of dreams, the Western concept of the unconscious may be comparable in some ways to the "spirit realm," the "other world," or other purported realities of which the dreamer is usually unawa re during wakefulness. The language of the dream can be described in terms of dream images as aspects of human imagination or as actual characters cmd events that exist in a parallel or non-ordinary reality. The dreamer's life situation often needs to be studied in terms of community concerns, e.g., hunting, harvesting, fighting, worshiping.</p>

<p>Techniques of working with dreams may include both individual and group dreamwork, if both are present in a given system. The dreamworkers in native cultures might be shamans, mediums, priests, priestesses, etc. Native dreamworking techniques would include those carried out by the tribal practitioner, the family, or the community as a whole. Dreamworking often plays a more important role in native societies than in Western culture, as do anomalous dreams. It is no surprise that these two facets were omitted by Ullman and Zimmerman; I added them because of their ubiquitous presence in native dreamworking systems.</p>

<p>As an example of how the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model can be used cross-culturally, I read accounts of the way dreams were used by the Maricopa tribe. Located in southeastern California, and a member of the Hokan-Yuman linguistic group, the Maricopa Indians lived in domed bark, thatched, or hide houses. When the Europeans arrived in North America, the Maricopa cultivated maize but also gained sustenance from a variety of wild plants and game (Yenne, 1986). At the heart of the Maricopa culture was the dream experience. Spier (1970) remarks that "it was the one thing of which they constantly talked, the [most] significant aspect of their life ... .Dream experience was at the bottom of all success in life, and as such [was] their constant preoccupation. Learning was replaced by dreaming" (p. 236). The way that dreams were used by the Maricopa responds to each of the questions proposed by the modified Ullman-Zimmerman model:</p>

<h3>1. {What is the function of dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams were believed to be nighttime adventures that expressed "spirit, " i.e., supernatural power.</p>

<h3>2. {What motivates people to recall their dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was held that dreams bestowed special abilities (e.g., to heal, to hunt); dreams often produced sacred songs and, rarely, entire song cycles. Dreams enabled guardian spirits to interact with the dreamer. Dreams predicted the future so that the dreamer could attempt to avoid or exploit the forthcoming event. Dreams indicated the degree of success the dreamer might expect in his or her life.</p>

<h3>3. {What is the source of dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was believed that one's soul was "taken out" by power animals or spirits during dreaming to a "dream world," the source of dreams. Songs, cures, future events, etc., were revealed to the soul during dreaming.</p>

<h3>4. {What is the language of dreams?}</h3>

<p>It was thought that dream images were entities from the "dream world" that depicted dreamers' potential abilities, forthcoming circumstances, etc. For example, dream images of Eagle indicated that the dreamer could become a great singer, of Buzzard or Coyote to become a healer, of Mockingbird to become an orator, of Frog to become a sorcerer, of Crow to become a thief. lt was believed that men who dreamed of a certain mountain would become "Berdaches" (i.e., transvestites) and that dreams of birds fighting each other meant that the dreamer would become sick.</p>

<h3>5. {Are dream symbols universal?}</h3>

<p>Meanings of dream images were the same for all tribal members, but there could be multiple meanings for some images, e.g., Buzzard could reveal an enemy's location as well as disclose cures.</p>

<h3>6. {What is the role of one's life situation in dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams could be rehearsals for life events, e.g., pregnancy. One's success depended on dreaming, but it was believed that children who dreamed too much might experience a sex change. The Maricopa took the position that most of their dreams dealt more with the contemporary scene than with tribal myths.</p>

<h3>7. {What techniques are used to work with dreams?}</h3>

<p>Dreams were frequently discussed among friends. When dreamers told their dreams, they would begin by mentioning the song from their dream, if one was present. Later, song cycles would review important individual dreams for the benefit of the entire community.</p>

<h3>8. {What is the role of the dreamworker?}</h3>

<p>The shaman and the song leader were the tribal authorities on dreams, and would discuss dreams with tribal members. The shaman was considered the expert regarding the cultural meanings of dreams, but both practitioners would frequently dream songs themselves, and would decide what songs of other dreamers would be incorporated into song cycles. However, a dreamer would not reveal a dream to anyone else if the dream involved a spirit visitation over a long period of time; the dreamer would be trained as a warrior, an orator, or a member of some other vocation during sleep. It was only after the spirits pronounced their preparation complete that the dreamer could use the powers they granted.</p>

<h3>9. {What role do dreams play in the culture?}</h3>

<p>It was held that spirits only manifest themselves in dreams, and that they grant specific powers to dreamers who are conscientious and prepared. More than any other activity, dreams established and reinforced the unity of the Maricopa culture.</p>

<h3>10. {How are anomalous dreams viewed?}</h3>

<p>It was believed that supernatural power only comes in dreams. The Maricopa used the same word {cara'g} for "spirit" and "dream."</p>

<p>The educational and training function by dreams among the Maricopa demonstrate how malleable the dreaming process is, and how a culture can shape its members' dreams. The social roots of the dream have been discussed by Ullman (1960) who observed how cultural myths serve to make experience intelligible, and that the unsolved problems of individuals in that culture are worked with within that mythic framework. Myths often come to life in a dream as sources of support or as sources of cmxiety, depending on the underlying nature of the immediate conflict (p. 184).</p>

<p>This brief discussion illustrates the value of studying dream systems from other cultures. It can demonstrate the limits of social frameworks in which the individual dream operates, as well as the limits of idiosyncratic elements that dreamers bring to their dream experience. It is easier to detect mythic elements in the dreams of people from native societies than from dreamers from societies without a monolithic mythic structure. In these cases, however, the impact of family and institutional myths may be detected. There is an urgent need for more information in these areas, and cross-cultural research can play an important role in this quest.</p>

<p>On a bright April morning in 1975, I had the following dream: Across the room from where I sat frustrated by my inability to create, a group of women taught arts and crafts at large tables. I arose from my lonely corner to leave in a spirit of failure and despair. As I walked away, a voice boomed out "At least there is AION!" I awoke to the new day in Zurich, Switzerland with the letters A-I-O-N emblazoned on my mind. I walked to the morning lecture at the Jung Institute - puzzled. What is AION?</p>

<p>At noon I joined a friend for lunch in his room near the Institute. As I related my dream, I looked to the bookshelf to my right. Squarely before my eyes stood the title AION: The Phenomenology of The Self (Vol. 9.,11 The Collected Works of C. G. Jung). This and other synchronistic events and dreams confirmed my calling to work on the frontiers of inner space. </p>

<p>Whereas many Jungians explored the depths of symbols, archetypes, complexes and myths, I was drawn to Jung's idea of active imagination and the transcendent function. </p>

<h2>Waking Dream Re-entry</h2>

<p>Waking dream re-entry is a particular approach to active imagination in which the dreamer re-enters the dream space while fully awake. Effective questions assist the dreamer to act consciously within the waking dream. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stampeded by My First Love: A dreamer shared a recurring nightmare, still vivid after forty years. "I was standing on a path in a meadow where horses were grazing. The horses stampeded. I fell on the path and awoke in terror as their hooves crashed down on my face. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked: "Can you see yourself in the dream?" she responded, "Yes." "How old are you?" "Four!" she responded in surprise. "What was happening when you were four?" "Oh! That was when my parents divorced. They sent me to my grandparents' horse ranch." "What is important to you about horses?" "They are my first love. Ah! I see." </p>

<p>Can you see yourself in the dream now?" "Yes." "What do you see?" "I see the horses coming. I fall. I wake up as the hooves come down on my face." "Now, go back, only this time stay in the dream. If you could do anything differently, what would you do?" "If I could reach up and grab a mane, I might save myself." "Go there now. Do you see it?" "Yes. The horses are bearing down. I reach up and grab the mane of a big chestnut. I pull myself up on his back. Wow!" "What is happening now?" "I feel his power beneath me. I feel on top of things." "What do you want to do?" "I want to ride off... Oh! I didn't realize how angry I felt toward my parents for leaving me." </p>

<h2>Instant Re-play and The Inner Image</h2>

<p>Instant re-play allows the dreamer, who has wandered up a blind alley, to return to the point of choice and pursue a course of action from a new emotional standpoint. The ability to explore various emotional choices to their natural end, in the waking dream, provides the dreamer clear pictures of the obstacles and consequences of paths that might otherwise prove costly in waking life. </p>

<p>From Jung's definition of the inner image, as a "condensed expression of the psychic situation as a whole", it follows that as the psychic situation changes so does the inner image; and as the inner image changes, so does the psychic situation. The goal is to participate consciously in the movement of the psyche as it spontaneously reflects its responses to our actions and choices within the waking dream. </p>

<p>By discovering ways that the psyche moves us toward healing and reconciliation, we learn how to accelerate the healing relationship between the dreamer, the dreamed, and the world.</p>

<p>Family-related feelings and family consciousness are some of the most powerful influences on the psychological patterns of individuals. The influence of family patterns is extraordinarily powerful in its depth and intensity. Because of this, we frequently dream about the members of our families. It is quite common and normal to have dreams in which family members are prominently involved. The vast majority of these dreams are the usual dreams in which a parent or sibling is doing something that we generally recognize as their normal behavior. Sometimes, however, they are doing something unusual or even paradoxical in our dreams. Very often, extremely strong feelings and images occur which show us the emotions we feel toward these special people in our lives. The dream, with its strange contours and story-line, is the perfect field on which to portray "raw" emotions, and consequently, the dream can really be a pulse taken on the heartbeat of family life.</p>

<p>Over the last century Freud and others have told us that dreams both hide and reveal what people deep down <em>really</em> feel and think about each other and themselves. In the dream state our hold on reality is not as well guarded as it is when we are wide awake. Our psychological defenses are to a large extent gone and what appears to be "reality" becomes very intense and visual. We have learned from jung and his followers that there are great spiritual energies, treasures, and messages from the collective unconscious hidden in dreams. This collective unconscious is a vast reservoir of knowledge, wisdom, and experience that has been experienced and collected by humanity through the ages.</p>

<p>We also know that lucid dreaming and ancient healing practices make use of entering the dream in a certain kind of way and using its power to transform reality. Thus it has become quite clear that we can influence the dream much more than we had earlier thought we could. finally we know from many parapsychological studies that ESP or psi occurs a great deal in certain kinds of dreams, especially between dreamers who are both dreaming about the same person. Any number of possibilities can occur when we are dreaming because the "boundaries" between individuals change significantly in the dream state. </p>

<p>For example, after a sleepfilled night in December, my wife and I mentioned our dreams to each other as is our custom. I had dreamed a strange dream in which a "grandmother type" was trying to reach or catch me. She triggered "mixed feelings" in me as to whether she was trying to protect me or somehow "get me." Also in the dream the grandmother attempted to steal or cut off a pickle I had! Having a somewhat Freudian lens, I made note of the sexual aspect of this. I later woke with a slightly eerie feeling about the dream. </p>

<p>On the same night my wife dreamed my grandmother had a necklace with a moon-shaped crescent locket which fell partly from her neck and turned into a knife or sharp edge. My wife then wondered in the dream whether the grandmother was gay. </p>

<p>Notice the correspondences in the grandmother images, the sexual feelings, and the act of cutting. These appeared in both dreamscapes. Neither of us had discussed grandmothers for a long time and we could remember no events recently that would account for the dream in terms of day residue. </p>

<p>While on a post-doctoral fellowship, I had the opportunity to study the dreams of families in therapy. To my surprise, we discovered that recurrent patterns of interaction and behavior are reflected in the dreams of each family member. This was especially true when the family was going through a crisis or some intense situation. </p>

<p>We noted the simple fact that families are often living in the same place, including the same house and rooms for decades and sometimes for generations. They are often in similar sleep and dream cycles at the same time of the night. Certain coordinating tendencies could be seen. It became very clear to us that the major emotional issues in the family were each reflected in slightly different ways in each family member's inner landscape. In a certain sense, each family member's dream life reflected the dream life of each other family member. </p>

<p>In one family, we worked with the following recurring dream of a 15 year old girl. She dreamed that she "escaped" from her parents' house and jumped into their car. As she drove away, the father would run toward her but never manage to quite catch her. The closer he got, the faster the car went. Finally the girl fully escaped him only to run headlong into a telephone pole and kill herself. In this family's therapy sessions, the themes of autonomy and separation with a great deal of anxiety occurred repeatedly. The daughter fought continually with her parents over her own intense involvement with a young man of whom the family did not approve. She felt rebellious and dominated by her parents, in particular her father. However, when she stayed away from home too long, she began to experience somatic problems and wanted to "lose" herself in male companionship. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dalegottlieb.com/" target="_blank"></p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfamil-1.jpg" alt="Couple dancing" width="500" height="auto"/></p>

<p></a></p>

<p>Another dream by the girl's 12 year old sister revealed a similar theme. The younger girl dreamed that a large "awful" man ran around screaming at her mother, her older sister, and herself. Finally, the man stepped on all three but did not kill them. The dream recurred several times. The family that provided this dream series was composed of a father who had a manic-depressive psychosis, an extremely religious, compulsive mother, and two teenage girls. All three women in the family had psychosomatic problems, such as stomach cramps, persistent gas pains, migraines, and frequent depression.</p>

<p>In working with families in therapy and others, we noted that psi or telepathy often occurs in a variety of situations. We noted that different families naturally had different styles and that certain families communicated, albeit irregularly, with each other through dreams. Some families rarely, if ever, did. In some measure these psi or paranormal dreams can be predic- ted and observed. We found this a very exciting discovery and as we talked with others, we found out more and more people have had the same kind of experiences in their families too. </p>

<p>What we discovered was a field of <em>shared</em> images, ideas, and feelings in each individual within the family. This shared family emotional field, which we call the family unconscious, is a shifting, interconnected field of energy that does not obey the conventional rules of space and time in the waking state. This field of interconnected energy, influence, and information in many ways parallels some of the developments in sub-atomic physics. In a curious way, each emotional dreamscape reflected or implicated each other dreamscape. A certain kind of hologram appeared in which each part could reflect all other parts in slightly different ways. </p>

<p>We know that our "boundaries" and identities intermingle in the dream state with those we dream about. This seems to take a systematic approach when it comes to the dreams of people who are deeply and powerfully interconnected with each other over years and years by shared events, feelings, and patterns of behavior such as in family life. The powerful emotions and the shared histories of families make this possible. There also seems to be a significant rise in psi experiences among such dreamers. As we have outlined in <em>The Family Unconscious</em>, dreams among family members can be used for all kinds of transpersonal work, including family therapy and other kinds of healing. As we continue to collect data about family dreams and explore other areas of the family unconscious, we are growing more and more convinced that a vast reservoir of healing is located in the collected dreams and memories of the people who are most dear to us through so many important years of our lives.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>After twenty years of lucid dreaming and many hundreds of lucid dreams, I had <em>had</em> it. </p>

<p>The <em>maya</em> of dreaming, the <em>maya</em> of waking and the <em>maya</em> of being consciously aware in the dream state, I discovered, all seemed creative constructions that were activated and informed by my thoughts, expectations, feelings, and beliefs. My experienced reality, I came to see, was largely self-created and self-reflected.</p>

<p>Yet somehow I intuitively felt that behind all of this <em>maya</em> was something—some motivating force, some energy, some thing beyond me and my beliefs, thoughts, and expectations. It seemed to me that beyond the symbolic feedback and entrancing worldly drama of samsara must lay the source of the myriad worlds. I sought the source. </p>

<p>It was then that I realized I had only one choice: to go <em>beyond</em> lucid dreaming; to let go of my own expectations, my thoughts and limiting conceptions, my self history and attachments—to let it all go and then experience the reality beyond thought and belief, the base reality, the source of what is. </p>

<p>For years in lucid dreams, I had surrendered to the awareness behind the dreaming. Consciously aware in the dream state, I would shout out, “Show me something that I should see!” and then watch as I was deposited, conscious and aware, into a powerfully meaningful dream setting. Lucidly surrendering to the awareness behind the dreaming taught me to trust implicitly the larger nature of the dreaming self and its wisdom. </p>

<p>But now, I knew that to experience the reality behind all of this, meant letting go of all of this. To surrender to one’s inner self was one thing, but to surrender to the source of <em>maya</em> took surrendering to a completely new level. </p>

<p>Lying awake in bed one night at this time, I inwardly heard the question, “So you are ready to let go of everything? Every thought, every memory, every belief?” Because I truly had had it with maya, I answered, “Yes!” The quiet voice returned with a simple analysis, “So you’re willing to allow yourself to cease?” </p>

<p>That question brought a sober finality to my quest. How far was I willing to take this venture beyond lucid dreaming? How deeply did I want to know what lay beyond apparent reality? </p>

<p>Realizing that all these states— dreaming, waking, lucid dreaming— appeared as creative constructions formatively created by the mind, I knew my response to that sober question must be, “Yes, if that’s what it takes.” </p>

<p>Perhaps it wasn’t that night, but soon something strange occurred to me. Waking in the morning and turning to my dream journal to jot down the night’s dreaming, all I could recall was blue light. Searching my mind, I realized that I didn’t have a dream—only an experience of blue light. No action, objects, dream figures or plot, not even a “me.” Just an awareness of blue light. </p>

<p>In my book, <em><a href="https://www.lucidadvice.com/books/lucid-dreaming-gateway-to-the-inner-self/">Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</a></em>, I mention how one morning after a night of experiencing dreamless blue light, my wife asked me at the breakfast table, “Robert, what’s happening to you?” A bit taken aback by such a strange question, I responded, “What do you mean?” She then told me how she had wakened in the night and saw my face; she told me I looked like I was in “bliss.” </p>

<p>I muttered something about trying to understand consciousness and left it at that, though I felt surprised my wife had noticed “something” was happening to me. </p>

<p>Actually, even I did not understand what was really happening to me. As if I had driven off the normal map of human experience and was now bushwhacking through uncharted territory, I had no context to place this in, or weathered guru to provide explanations. I felt on a path of my own making, being guided by my simple faith, fearlessness, and trust. I had had it with maya, and deeply intended to experience the source of apparent reality. </p>

<p>As the months slipped by, a transformational, culmination experience occurred, which I can only call a nondual experience of the light of awareness by awareness itself. At last, I had gone beyond lucid dreaming—beyond thought and self, beyond the self-constructed illusions of the mind—and reached something unfathomable, luminous, and empty, <em>pure awareness</em>. </p>

<p>For years, I kept this to myself. How can you explain going beyond lucid dreaming? How can the self discuss a self-less experience? Yet at my core, something had been transformed. Like survivors of NearDeath Experiences (NDEs), I no longer had a fear of death. I began to see how fear kept us corralled in a self adopted realm of limitation and constraint. At a deep level, I felt expansive freedom and space. </p>

<p>Almost three years later, I happened to attend a presentation by the Buddhist Bon Lama, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, at the Association for the Study of Dreams conference in Hawaii. Speaking about the Buddhist’s long tradition of dream yoga (using conscious awareness in the dream state), he explained that its ultimate goal was to experience a profound, non-dual state: the clear light of awareness.</p>

<p>It’s not for me to say whether my experience equates to this ultimate experience of dream yoga. However, I can say that lucid dreaming’s deeper explorations naturally allow for a transformational view of the human experience and the nature of reality. </p>

<p>Followed deeply and with pure intent, conscious awareness in the dream state allows us to experiment with the fluid nature of time and space as we consciously seek out telepathic and clairvoyant experiences, and use our awareness for tasks like focusing directed healing energy on our physical self. Lucid dreaming enables us to go beyond our normal assumptions of dream figures and objects and interact with the awareness behind the dream, the larger Self, even surrendering to its broader perspective. </p>

<p>Beyond self transformation, however, lucid dreaming provides science a revolutionary psychological tool to conduct experiments while consciously aware in the dream state. Imagine an experiment in which a lucid dreamer seeks out and retrieves precognitive or clairvoyant information that he or she gives to the scientist upon waking. It’s definitely possible. In my book, I provide numerous examples of experienced lucid dreamers who have succeeded in their own personal experiments. </p>

<p>Once the province of parapsychologists and Buddhist monks, lucid dreaming has radical transformational potential to usher in a new age of human potential and greater awareness. Individually, scientifically and culturally, lucid dreaming can help us discover the broader dimensions of Self and in so doing, transform society and its relationships. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Do you ever wish you could have a really <em>BIG DREAM?</em> You might imagine what it would be like: a great opportunity. Some people report having life defining dreams that remain vividly in mind for years. </p>

<p>Who wouldn’t want such an experience? In ones’ imagination, the <em>big dream</em> might be extremely vibrant, or be of the utmost clarity. Most certainly, it would be memorable and life changing. The dream might spark a spiritual awakening. </p>

<p>In an attempt to find out more about the big dream, I looked through my dream book collection. Some of the authors assured readers that their books on dreams provided all the information they needed to know about dreams. Nevertheless, scanning tables of contents, chapter titles, section labels, and indices failed to turn up any direct reference to the big dream. </p>

<p>The big dream was even elusive on the internet. The term was there. Some “big dream” sites attempted to tell internet surfers what they “really” want out of life. One site had a synchronicity card pack for sale. Another site was about a church building fund. Even “bigdream.com” billed as “your source for virtually anything” wasn’t a source of information about big dreams. On a hunch, I revisited The World Dream Book by Sarvananda Bluestone. He used the term, “great dream.” He also provided a simple yet significant reminder that “ … there are many kinds of dreams, it lies with the dreamer to determine the nature of the dream and it remains for each person to determine his dreams’ lessons.” </p>

<p>There is certainly the chance that many of us have had a big dream and failed to recognize it. We’ve been conditioned in our society to expect important things to make a big impression. The big dream may fail to get our full attention at first. </p>

<p>Symbolically, the International Association for the Study of Dreams (ASD) has been like a big dream for me that began quietly but grew in importance as I worked with it. It has helped me to satisfy my intention to learn more about dreams by providing reading material, group study opportunities, dream sharing groups, and research reports. Most importantly, it has provided the opportunity to be a part of a dedicated community of dreamers. Rita Dwyer and <a href="../@jeancampbell">Jean Campbell</a> are vital members of that community. </p>

<p>I met Rita when I attended an Association for the Study of Dreams annual conference for the first time. Prior to the conference, I had little contact with the organization. Rita made quite a fuss over me. She explained how she had seen my name as a founding member of the association on paperwork for about 14 years and wondered who this phantom person might be. Her welcome made me feel very much at home during a personally and professionally rough time in my life. Immediately after the conference, I got to enjoy her company when a small group of members went out to supper before returning home. Remembering the event brought a heartfelt smile as I recalled such a warm feeling of belonging. Over time, I became aware of how vitally important Rita was to the association and all of the people she has welcomed. Years later, at another conference, I was just turning to leave the ball, when Rita reached out and asked me to dance. I wondered if she had sensed that I felt alone and reached out once again to make me feel right at home. </p>

<p>I met Jean Campbell at an ASD Conference in Copenhagen a few years ago. I knew about her marvelous “Dream Bridge” project that allowed children from different countries to share their dreams. I can recall with fondness, sitting on a restaurant boat with Jean and another member as Jean shared her dreams, plans, and hopes for the organization. The weather was chilly and rainy, but she projected an air of confidentiality that made me feel like a life long friend. At a subsequent conference, I was pleased to learn that she had been elected as president of the association and I worked just briefly with her on a project. More recently, I received a note card from Jean in the mail. She was complementing me on an article I had written. I was tickled to read the compliment in her beautifully written script even before I had gotten a chance to see the article in print myself. </p>

<p>Like dream characters, Rita Dwyer and Jean Campbell came into my life for an admittedly brief period of time, but have had an ongoing and meaningful effect. In order to fully appreciate the positive impact these two dedicated individuals have had on the lives of others, however, we would literally have to visit with people all over the world. You can bet that Rita and Jean represent portions of the big dreams of many individuals. So, if you get a chance to meet Rita and Jean, be sure to see that opportunity as potentially life changing, something like a big dream coming your way. ∞</p>

<p>It was summer of 1985 when I met <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a> in the hallway lounge of the University of Charlottesville, Virginia at the second conference of the Association for the study of Dreams (ASD). A few months prior to the conference I had a very disturbing precognitive dream that needed serious attention. I was in my mid-twenties, a graduate student conducting research on insomnia and apnea at the University of Stevens Point, Wisconsin. </p>

<p>I called Stanley in California and asked if I could meet with him at the conference in Charlottesville to work on my dream. He agreed immediately and we set a time and a place. The dream was about my father and it was a matter of life and death. I was familiar with Stanley’s research from my training in parapsychology. I thought he would be the best person to help me work with this kind of dream. But I had no idea that this simple request of having him work with my dream was to be the beginning of a life-long collegial and personal friendship. </p>

<p>With his openness and gentle manner, he asked me to tell him the dream. I was emotional while I recited the short dream. He asked “How do you know this is a precognitive dream?” I gave him examples of my past precognitive dreams and their particular felt sense. Without hesitation, he confirmed my intuition and replied “O.K. Let’s see how we can work with this dream and do something about it!” I was so relieved with his reply. Others with whom I shared the dream only looked at the symbolic and psychological implications and did not even know how to approach the precognitive aspect. It took us over two hours, looking into the details of the situation, to create a plan to prevent the dream from happening. This solution was complicated, but we drafted a plan and I followed it step-by-step. Likewise, I asked that my family also follow it step-by-step. As a result, my father’s life was saved. </p>

<p>What most touched me about Stanley in that very first meeting was his quality of presence. He listened, had empathy and absolute compassion. Although he is always busy, in that moment he gave me/my dream all of his attention. His openness, brilliance, his humanity and wisdom shined through his humility. At the end of our meeting, I knew I was in the presence of <strong><em>an extraordinary human being</em></strong>. </p>

<p>With his encouragement, a few months later I moved to San Francisco. I attended his monthly dream training group for number of years at the Family Mediation Center and watched his approach with dreams; in particular, Personal Mythology and <a href="../@montagueullman">Ullman’s</a> Dream Appreciation group process. In the latter approach, every member takes the dream as if that is his/her own. When Stanley owned the dream, his creative mind would connect the metaphors and narrative of the dream into hyper-reality, filled them with psychological reflections and insights to the amazement of everyone in the group. Not repeating anyone else but acknowledging everyone’s contribution, he always had a fresh perspective to lend the dream. His mastery is also evident in the last part of the technique in Ullman’s approach, “Synthesis.” In this ‘closure’ part of Ullman’s suggested process, we watched Stanley’s brilliant mind at work. A master synthesizer and a true composer, he would weave together everyone’s input and interpretation of the dream, together with the life of the dreamer. Then he would give an entirely new and holistic narrative with reflection and great insight that would not only help the dreamer but everyone in the group. A complex networking of metaphors, ideas, psychological observations, personal narrative woven into an elegant synthesis creating a spatial and imaginal realm for whomever was present. Everyone was transfixed at his exceptional skill in dreamwork. When Stanley is working with dreams he is a shamanic practitioner. His model of working with dreams as a form of service was a great influence on my process of working with dreams. </p>

<p>Stanley is known for accomplishing so much in one lifetime. One day in 1986, I asked him “But how do you manage to do so many things?” He could not explain but he encouraged me to come to his office and watch how he worked. So I did. I went to his office a few times, I sat behind a desk making illustrations for his new book <em>Dreamworking</em> and graphics for some of his articles for parapsychology handbooks while watching him work. In a middle size office there were several desks each with different projects, quite orderly; he attended notes to each piece of paper at hand, each mail he opened, he replied to immediately. There was no such thing as taking care of it later. That is the reason he still responds to inquiries immediately. He works as if he had six hands and several brains! He deals with different topics, different types of inquiries and his mind had to keep switching from one to another. But he always concentrated at the task at hand. He was extremely focused and attentive. A ‘multitasker’ par excellence! </p>

<p>That was my learning ground. I really don’t know anyone who has accomplished as much as he has in so many areas. </p>

<p>As someone from another culture and who at times has suffered from discrimination — even in my own field — I’ve found Stanley to be a genuine lover of cultural diversity. He embraces people from many other nationalities. His work and on-going research with South Americans, Russian, East Europeans, Native Americans, Africans now Middle Easterners has given him a much larger perspective, openness and compassion towards the common places in humanity as well as an appreciation for cultural diversity. He indeed has become an extraordinary multidimensional being. </p>

<p>One of our meaningful collaborative efforts was bringing this diversity as program co-chairs for the IASD conference in 1991, which was hosted by another dear colleague <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Robert van de Castle</a>. Ironically the conference was held on the same campus where we first met — in Charlottesville! We dedicate the conference to diversity and interdisciplinary studies and I was impressed with the number of researchers who have become close friends of his from such diverse groups. We invited keynote speakers from Native American, Afro-American, Spanish and a North American cultures. This was the first time such diverse keynote speakers were introduced into the program and ever since then diversity has become an integral and important part of IASD. Our message in that conference was that dreams belong to every culture, every religion. In other words, dreams belong to the people of the world. </p>

<p>Our collaboration with the book <em>Extraordinary Dreams</em> (SUNY, 2002) brought us ever so closer. This was another diverse collaboration with his colleague André Percia de Carvalho, a Brazilian psychologist. Challenging as it was to bring three voices from different cultures, the results were rich and rewarding. In that process, I learned how important it is for Stanley to see that others be properly acknowledged, sometimes at the expense of not acknowledging himself. He does not seek competition but true collaboration and contribution. What makes Stanley stand out as an extraordinary human being is his nonegoic, non-judgmental, ever encouraging and generous attitude and spirit. He has opened doors for many young scholars internationally. His total commitment, dedication and service for transformation of consciousness is absolutely admirable. It was the inspiration of having a mentor like Stanley who works so consistently and diligently that gave me the courage and strength—against all odds—to create the dream studies program at John F. Kennedy U. </p>

<p>Stanley has a keen sense of perception and I always trust his insights. Although he is internationally known as a serious scholar, author and teacher, he also has a very eccentric and creative side. He is a lover of theater, music and the arts. He loves to dance and always without fail shows up at the IASD Dream Ball costumed up as a dream character. His insights to my artworks and performances have been invaluable, original and profound. I am always curious about his comments. Having known and worked with Stanley for almost twenty-five years now, I know he evolves with modern life and at the same time has the wisdom of the ancient world. He is one of those special beings on earth who is mortal yet immortal. His stories, influences, contributions to humanity will be passed on for many generations, making him eternal. </p>

<p>Stanley, I am ever so grateful to you for being my mentor, colleague and friend. You have been a pillar of strength in every community you have been involved. I feel privileged to know you and I am looking forward to many years of stimulating collaboration and creation with you. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong><em>Exploring our dreams helps us discover essential parts of ourselves and outgrow old patterns of thinking. They bring images that remind us that we have an innate ability to transform our lives.</em></strong></p>

<p>"So, if I tell you my dream, you'll interpret it for me, won't you?”. When Teresa came to my office, she was having great difficulty relating to her new coworker. "Of course not," I replied. That answer puzzled her. "But when we explore the dream," I continued, "you will be able to tell me what it means to you." Smiling, as if she didn't quite believe me, she closed her eyes as I suggested and, in the present tense - as if reliving the experience - she began to narrate her nightmare. It included the image of a plastic doll, dismembered, on the table in her office. It was the only dream she was able to remember at the time, and she had it, interestingly enough, the night before our first appointment.</p>

<p>Teresa didn't remember sharing her dreams with anyone, so why pay attention to them? Our culture, skeptical of their possible meaning or stunned by their complexity, has long trivialized these nocturnal experiences. "It's just a dream," we tell our children when they wake up distressed during the night, hoping that they will quickly forget what frightened them. After all, we usually don’t like to think about things we don’t understand—things which for that very reason frightens us; those strange stories, sometimes scary, usually disconcerting, that occur every time we go to sleep. And not just once, but several times: in the course of a night, we dream between four and six times. Despite this, there are many people who, like Teresa, say they don’t remember their dreams, except for some nightmares that, they argue, they would do better to forget quickly. However, remembering these deeply unpleasant dream experiences can be of great help, because, although they don’t seem to favor our mental health, nightmares are a message, a cry from our psyche that’s asking us to listen to ourselves and realize that there is something going on that we should pay attention to. </p>

<p>In other words, the intensity of this type of dreams responds to the need to ensure that its content won’t be forgotten.</p>

<p>There is no such a thing as a bad dream. They can all help us to recognize aspects of ourselves that we ignore. They also show the innate creative resources we have to relate to day-to-day conflicts and can offer surprising revelations about our emotional world. This was the case for Teresa, who suddenly remembered another broken doll that she especially loved. Her sister smashed it when they were children during a fight. Her sister was five years younger than her; interestingly -she realized- the same age difference as her co-worker. Teresa understood that the rejection she felt towards that girl, a newcomer to the company, was rooted in a complicated relationship with her sister that needed to be reviewed. This is one of the peculiarities of dream language: a curious ability to bring together elements of our past and our present. This was also one of Freud’s observations - one that even his detractors regarded as a key insight,  and that, according to many contemporary neuroscientists, reinforces the theory according to which dreaming favors learning. </p>

<p>When Teresa associated the broken doll in her dream with that memory of her childhood, she felt that something in her was released. It is what we call the “eureka -or aha- moment”, the instant when the person understands what the dream is referring to. As I had warned her, it was she herself who would finally find meaning in her nightmare. Other people's suggestions may be interesting, but ultimately only the dreamer can say with certainty what his/her dream means. No one has the right to prevent him/her from experiencing the "eureka moment" of discovery. Although a psychologist who knows the terrain can help you with techniques and good questions, it will be the dreamer themselves who will eventually unravel the dream, link it to waking life, or recognize what issue it brings them in contact with. For this reason, the popular dictionaries of dream symbols are, to say the least, unreliable. In reality, when we explore a dream in search of its meaning, what we are doing is selecting one of many possible meanings. All dreams have multiple layers of meaning, all of which are important. In fact, their images can symbolize different things at the same time. For this reason, I don’t usually speak of discovering the meaning but of building it, since, depending on the maturity of our gaze, our present capacities or the vital area that concerns us, we will tend to explore one or another layer of the dream. It may refer, for example, to the dreamer's relationship with money, to their creativity, to their sexuality, it may be referring to their physical health, to their spirituality.... And it may allude to these or other themes at the same time, so that the dream makes a portrait of the relationship underlying those different aspects, one that we often don’t see clearly in wakefulness. Continuing with Teresa's story, her dream allowed her to see the connection between a social relationship (with her co-worker), a familial one (the one she’d had, and still has, with her sister) and a personal psychological wound. Frequently, the symbols of our dreams refer to elements of our wakefulness and also to internal characteristics of our psyche. Teresa's doll was one of these cases: it was a metaphor of how she had felt as a child. When she saw that her father - always from the perspective of a child who felt that she was daddy's "doll" - paid more attention to her sister than to her, jealousy invaded her. </p>

<p>We could then see that the discomfort that brought her to the consultation - the bad relationship with a colleague who had also received attention from the boss that she considered excessive - was rooted in an experience from her childhood that still affected her. In fact, Teresa "decided" to be responsible, efficient and determined, in reaction to that experience and others like it. She had carried that pattern to try to surpass her sister in her father's eyes, right up to the present. Exploring your dreams helps you outgrow obsolete patterns of thinking and behaviour and allows you to become all that you really are. Instead of thinking of the complexity of dream language as a barrier to understanding, you can understand this feature as a training platform. Even if you don't understand what they refer to, or are not accompanied by a specialist with whom to explore them, attending to your dreams always has positive effects. Dreams remind us that we are much more than we think we are, they put us in touch with controversial aspects of ourselves that we tend to reject and, also, they connect us with our creativity, with our imagination and with a healthily playful perspective. They remind us that we have an innate capacity to transform our outer and inner reality. By listening to your dreams, being fascinated by their language and feeling what they provoke in you, asking yourself about their meaning and trying to take them into account in your waking life, you will be broadening your vision, favoring the awakening of your potential and, in short, becoming more aware of the mystery that you are. It is true that sometimes we don’t remember anything when we wake up. This "forgetfulness" is influenced by several factors: some are physiological, but most are of psychological, social or cultural origin. The good news is that we can change that. Teresa, by the way, not only understood what the dream expressed, but was also able to work on improving her relationship with her sister, her co-worker and, most especially, with herself. </p>

<p>Some time later, she told me another dream: she was at the beach playing with the sand. For her it was unthinkable to act as she did in the dream, carefree and happy. For me, it was the sign that she was ready to relax her pretensions of being what she was not. To close the process, I suggested that she honored that last dream and spent some time alone on the beach, playing with the sand. This way she clearly told her unconscious she’d gotten the message it previously sent to her with that doll dream.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption"><i>Glimpses From Beyond The Ego: Dreams, Zen, &amp; Nature by <a href="../@ billstimson">William Stimson</a>, 327pp, published July 2020</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>It is remarkable how many books about dreams have been published in recent years. In part, this is the result of the efforts of the <a href="https://www.asdreams.org/">International Association for the Study of Dreams</a>, which has created a world-wide network that has linked dream scientists, dream therapists, dream artists, and dreamers with no qualifications other than their interest in the topic. One would have thought that everything that could be written about dreams had already found its niche in publishers’ catalogs and people’s bookcases.</p>

<p>Not quite. <a href="../@billstimson">William Stimson</a> has produced a unique personal account of how dreams shaped his life, taking him on a heroic journey that will serve as a manual for many readers who desire to use their dreams as a vehicle for their own spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and creative development.</p>

<p>Stimson’s book delves deeper than other treatments of dreams. He shows how the current scientific paradigm of reductionism permeates many dream studies, with its emphasis on the chance evocation of images resulting from neurochemical reactions. Instead, he takes a non-linear, non-psychoanalytic approach. From this perspective, dreams come when they are ready to come. With a few exceptions, dreams are not under the dreamer’s control. Dreams reflect the reality of the dreamer’s everyday life, often revealing a crossroads and the path best chosen. This is why they served adaptive purposes over the millennia and this is why they are worth pondering. Dreams actually cooperate with dreamers in the hundreds of thousands of years that homo sapiens has lived on this Earth, and the earlier millennia when earlier species presaged what became nightly dream narratives.</p>

<p>From an autobiographical perspective, Stimson traces his interest in dreams to early contact with a Cuban curandero, a search for wild orchids, a foray into the composition of Spanish music, and his avid perusal of Lao Tzu, Chang Tzu, Socrates, Carl Gustav Jung, and – more recently – <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>. It was Ullman whose inspired dream appreciation method led to the formation of the International Association for the Study of Dreams and whose experience as a psychoanalyst convinced him that dreams are best interpreted by dreamers themselves, albeit it in a supportive setting where obscurity gives way to insight and where confusion turns into clarity. Self-acceptance, more than any other trait, is the key to Ullman’s method, and can lead to a lifestyle that infuses emotions, thoughts, and behavior during one’s waking hours.</p>

<p>One might say that this paradigm is what the world needs now, and the philosophy of Ullman’s method is appropriate to this time. The torn fabric of today’s world can be mended by those who dare to dive deeply into their own unconscious, indeed into the collective unconscious, to find the connecting threads that will harmonize with the cosmic dance, and keep participants in the human drama alive and thriving for some time to come.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>A Tarot deck can be a transformative participant in a dream group. I discovered this a few years ago at a dream theater workshop I was co-facilitating and realized it again this year at my monthly dream discussion group. </p>

<p>A woman in the dream theater workshop held a child’s stuffed toy aloft to represent a <em>mortally wounded bird</em> from her dream. Other participants, imagining the dream as their own, suggested that the bird and what it represented might need to die. The dreamer barely acknowledged their comments. Instead she gazed up at the stuffed bird and declared she would heal it by sheer force of will. </p>

<p>Frustrated by the impasse, a woman in the group took a Tarot deck out of her purse and randomly drew a card, which turned out to be Death/Rebirth. The Grim Reaper’s message was obvious: “Release the old and make room for new consciousness.” The dreamer quietly brought the stuffed bird down from its perch and set it aside. She could ignore her peers but not the pithy wisdom of the Tarot. </p>

<p>This year I introduced my monthly dream discussion group to a book I recently co-authored with artist Connie Lehman. <em>Titled Tarot Life Cards: Using Your Birthday to Chart Your Course</em>, the book comes with Connie’s deck of Major Arcana cards, the 22 Tarot trumps. Numerology based on a birthdate identifies one of these cards as a Life Card, the Tarot version of an astrology sign. Everyone also has a Year Card for each year following the birth year. </p>

<p>After the group discussed each dream, I invited the dreamer to pick a card. No one was obliged to do this, but most dreamers were eager to see what card would come up. Once again, the Tarot proved to be a powerful dream worker. </p>

<p>Jane offered this dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I go for medical treatment. There are a large number of people in the room. I feel I’m not seen and not heard. It’s my turn finally. I’m on an exam table. A young man (employed at the medical facility) stands far away. I insist he must come closer. He grabs a plastic storage container and sits on it. It’s too low. I still can’t see him. He says the surgery will be non-invasive and “some people compare it to when they had their wisdom teeth removed.” I ask whether it will be through the vagina or an incision. But all I hear is the word “cancer.” I feel railroaded and mistreated. I’m considering walking out when I wake up.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After we discussed the dream’s possible references to her health, Jane noted that her cousin was facing cancer surgery the following week. As the eldest of her siblings, Jane was providing updates about the life-and-death situation. She wondered how much of her own spiritual perspective to include in these missives, in part because she had been frustrated in her attempt to communicate at a recent family reunion. It was as if her “wisdom teeth” had been removed, symbolically, and she couldn’t assume the elder’s role she envisioned. </p>

<p>The young medical professional in the dream reminded Jane of a nephew she had seen at the reunion and the plastic storage containers reminded her of bins where she stored family papers she wanted to share with him and other relatives. </p>

<p>When Jane pulled the Tarot’s Hierophant/Pope card to reflect the dream, her first reaction was discomfort. She the air. He’s from the cast of the musical “Hair,” had left the Catholic faith of her youth and had no positive associations with a Pope. But Hierophant/Pope also “This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius!” is her Year Card for the current year. Like it or not, that archetype was asking for attention.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfctar-0.jpg" style="width:200px; margin: auto" /></p>

<p>I pointed out that the <em>Tarot Life Cards</em> deck combines the term “Hierophant” with “Pope” to evoke a broader form of moral authority. (A Hierophant was a priest in ancient Greece who acted as an intermediary between humans and the divine.) I also suggested that Jane consider Connie’s unconventional approach to the image.</p>

<p>In traditional Tarot decks, a Pope presides on a throne while two small, reverent figures crouch at his feet. Connie’s Hierophant/Pope, on the other hand, stands in a surreal floating boat made of the curved bodies of two women. He holds a scepter of sorts and a speech bubble broadcasts his words, but he depends on the women’s feminine energy to keep him afloat. The waves he rides evoke emotion, the unconscious and the divine feminine. </p>

<p>Picking the Pope card reinforced Jane’s sense of her potential role in her family. The <em>Tarot Life Card</em> deck’s innovative image showed her she could avoid being heavy handed in this role by balancing masculine and feminine energies. </p>

<p>Another dreamer, Marilyn, connected her dream to a Tarot card even before sharing the dream with the group: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m at the shore near where I grew up and there’s a crisis. A boat is stuck in the sand. I ask why this happened and people say, “Because you’re supposed to be steering.” Someone says, “You remind me of Marilyn. Do you know her?” and I say, “I AM Marilyn.”... I start the engine and go out on the water. As I’m steering the boat, I see a guy on a jet ski. He’s above me and then at my side and then soaring in the air. He’s from the cast of the musical “Hair,” and as he goes in and out of the water, he sings, “This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marilyn told us that “Hair” was first produced in 1968, the year she graduated from college and got married. Both for her and for society as a whole, it was a year of dramatic changes and new possibilities—as well as a Chariot year on Marilyn’s own Tarot life chart. She brought the dream to the group just before going on a family trip to China, where her daughter would pick up an adopted son. The Chariot card features a determined charioteer preparing for a journey into the unknown and Marilyn felt that the upcoming adventure, with all its unknowns, paralleled the profound shifts of her 1968 Chariot year. </p>

<p>When she pulled a card at random to reflect the dream, “Star” came up. A symbol of hope and optimism; the card echoed the feeling of the “Aquarius” song in the dream. When she found out that Aquarius is the astrology sign associated with the Star card, Marilyn exclaimed that both her husband and new grandson are Aquarians; she herself is a Cancer, the sign associated with the Chariot card.</p>

<p>In traditional versions of the Star, a demure nude woman in a Grecian drape pours jugs of water on the earth and into a stream. However, Connie’s card shows a woman giving birth to a five-pointed star with another large star on her head. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfctar-1.jpg" style="width:200px; margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Marilyn beamed, and the group cheered, when I read aloud the book’s description of the card: “Star squats boldly in the dark, unafraid. She knows that her newborn will light up the night.” ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>A taste of Cyberspace for those wondering what's going on with dreaming and Internet</em></p>

<p>If you haven't been online yet, your first experience might be something like walking into a surprise party. Everyone wants your attention and many will share your same interests, no matter how off-beat. I know that Al Gore talks about the "Information Super-highway" (1) and everyone gets excited about how much data is available but the real surprises online are the people. This human connection exists at several levels, from casual and committed one on one relationships, to global community connectivity and activism. As might be expected, these levels of relationship hold true for dream concerned individuals and groups as well. </p>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

<p>Originally designed as ARPA Net by the U.S. Defence Department in the late 1960's to protect political telecommunications in case of an atomic war, the net was a series of four computers that all shared &amp; exchanged the same information. By 1971 it had attracted the attention of the universities and there were 21 host computers, but no one was sure what the common language was going to be between all these computers. By 1982, the decision was made (TCP/ IP), and by 1986 there were 5,000 host computers , mostly at universities and government offices and all able to talk the same language and share the same information. By 1989, the Internet hit the public and media and there were 100,000 host computers. The last figure I heard for 1995 was that the Net had reached 5 million computers. (2)</p>

<p>To be connected to the internet, all one has to have now is a computer, a modem, some Internet software and an account with an Internet Service Provider. If you don't have a free university or government account, there are a multitude of providers and most now give you all the software you need when you sign up with them. The average cost ranges from $10 - $25 per month. The number of people using the Internet is already uncountable, but to give you a tool by which to guess the near future , I want to paraphrase Bill Clinton's October 1995 directive: "By the year 2000, all U.S. schools K-12 will be connected." (3) What will we and our children have access to when we start a computer net search for "Dreams"?</p>

<h2>Dreaming in Cyberspace</h2>

<p>To answer that question, it is important to know the distinction between the Internet and Cyberspace. The Internet is a more technical term, the way we connect with one another in computer mediated communications. Cyberspace is the place where this all happens. And there are several kinds of platforms or venues in Cyberspace that dream concerned individuals use. The most popular are E-mail, World Wide Web (WWW) and Usenet.</p>

<h2>Usenet, IRC and Chatrooms</h2>

<p>Usenet is a group of electronic discussion boards started in 1979 to discuss various university curriculum topics, but since that time Usenet has exploded into hundreds of topic from saving the rainforests to chat about the latest episode of the X-files. Like a real bulletin board, one can post messages, read other's messages and leave replies. The first dream bulletin board (alt.dreams) went up just a couple years ago and allows individuals to post dreams and dream related issues as well as making comments on the posts that go up. Some people want advice on how to recall dreams, some want their dreams interpreted, some want to start small online dreamsharing groups. The level of discussion is very uneven and the board is predominately used as a way for people new to dreaming online to ask questions and get connected with more serious projects. But I'm hoping in the near future to include on alt.dreams discussions on dream theory, dream research and the wide array of techniques used by dreamworkers. Also I see alt.dreams as an excellent venue for networking local and regional dream groups, distributing news and developing mutually supportive projects. </p>

<p>In the last year, two more dream related Usenet groups have appeared. The first is alt.dreams.lucid, a discussion board just for lucid dreaming issues, and alt.dreams.Castaneda, which discusses all of the Castaneda issues, but seems most invigorated by the variations on lucid dreaming that are being practiced. Other newsgroups such as alt.psychology.Jung and talk.religion.new age will occasionally discuss dreams in light of their own particular viewpoints. </p>

<p>A spin-off of the newsgroups are the real time internet Relay Chat channels. On the IRC channels you can enter one of hundreds of ongoing real time discussions, simply by typing in a sentence or two and sending it to a screen where others in the room are also sending sentences. Or you can create you own rooms, invite your friends or associates or wait for visitors. Complex interactions and threads can take place but generally the quality is usually lower than on Usenet. There are exceptions. These Chat rooms are also available on most commercial online servers and Fred Olsen has been doing dream reentry work on both Genie and AOL. His directed questions style works quite well in this real time mode. Another notable exception is the Dream Studio, which Donna Campos opens on Mondays nights at 6:00 PM EST on Compuserve. She invites a different guest each week to discuss a variety of dream topics. The key to these chat channels seems to be having a host or guiding moderator.</p>

<h2>The World Wide Web (WWW): Internet Gets a Friendly Face</h2>

<p>In 1990, a couple of CERN physicists in Switzerland were given the task of developing a network that could be used by a variety of international physicists. What they came up with was the World Wide Web, a system that could go out on the Net and use any resource. In 1993, Marc Andreessen gave this route a friendly face by developing for NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the Univ. of Ill. in Urbana-Champaign) a program called Mosaic browser. He gave Mosaic away to the public for free. By December of 1993, over a thousand browsers a day were being downloaded (taken from the net).</p>

<p>What these browsers do is allow net connected users to travel from one friendly page to another at the click of a mouse. These friendly pages, or web sites (collections of pages), run about $10.00 to $30.00 a month to put up commercially and are free to many university students. What do people put on these pages? Everything! Pictures of themselves and their kids, one's life story, all the things you want to sell, and links that let you jump to other sites, your friends' sites, your business site, similar interest sites. And so, of course, we all put the dreams and dream information we want other people to know about on our web pages.</p>

<p>There are now dozens of Web sites that include information on dreams and dreaming. Dream Network Journal has as site, Electric Dreams has a site, and even ASD and the Lucidity Institute Inc., have sites. A good place to start browsing is a directory of many (not all) dream sites on Yahoo web directory. I've also made available a file called Dream Guide to the Internet which covers most of the sites and how dreaming is represented online. (4) </p>

<p>There are also several dream sharing sites now on the Web. The most interactive and sophisticated at this time is Dream Link. At Dream Link, you can not only finds lots of information about dreams, but actually participate in interactive dreams sharing. It works kind of like a specialized bulletin board. You go to the site with a Web browser and leave your dream and information about your dream. Linton and Becky Hutchison distribute your dream to their network and put both your dream and comments on the dream back up on one of their web pages. The future of the Internet is to be found in the Web. The now static pages will give way to real time video channels and more Interactive forums. But at this time, the one thing you can't get on your Web browser is electronic mail, and e-mail rules the Internet.</p>

<h2>E-mail, E-zines and Mail Lists.</h2>

<p>In early 1993 when the Web was still more of a great idea than a reality, if you wanted to connect with someone on more than a superficial level you used email. We still do. E-mail is like a regular letter except that it's cheaper and faster. I can send a ten page letter from my home in San Francisco to my friends in Australia for about 3 cents. And it gets there in minutes. (Of course, they are probably asleep and won't read and reply for several hours!) What is even better, I can make a copy of that letter and send it to everyone I have-ever met in Cyberspace with an Internet e-mail address (say about a thousand addresses) for the same 3 cents. If I did this, I would probably get 999 letters back, each costing me 3 cents, telling me to knock it off and please send only relevant, personal letters - but I think the point is clear. </p>

<p>E-mail mini-dream groups are easy to start and inexpensive to maintain. They have sprung up all over the globe. Usually with a dozen or less participants, email groups share dreams and comments about each other's dreams. They may last a week, or become a permanent group of friends. </p>

<p>In August of 1993, I found one such community that had grown to about 30 members and put out every couple of weeks a magazine, (or e-zine) Electric Dreams. Originally the community used the e-zine to distribute dreams and comments on the dreams from previous issues. But the members wanted to cut down on the 2 week time lag between dreams and comments. The solution was to have the dreams distributed to those interested in commenting so that dreams and comments would be printed together every week or two. </p>

<p>These dreamsharings were certainly not the same as off-line or face-to-face groups, but I felt very excited about the process and felt there was a great networking potential in sharing dreams on a global scale. I had recently been impressed with the networking style of Jill Gregory, the director of the Novato Center for Dreams. Through a variety of news bulletins, dream groups and other interpersonal projects, the dreamers in the Bay area maintain a creative personal community, while at the same time staying in contact with the international dream community. I wanted to model this regional approach on a global scale and added news, projects and other forums to the Electric Dreams community - but the core of the process, the dreamsharing, still needed some anchoring. </p>

<p>Early in 1995 I found an online model for dreamsharing. John Herbert had been running a variation of <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> style groups on the America Online (AOL) Seniornet. John had also run these groups earlier on local Bulletin Boards or BBS and compared them to face-to-face groups. (5) These BBS are local computer networks that allow people to dial up and participate in various activities, from getting software to playing games, to doing genealogical research. He would have the participants work on one dream at a time, first asking clarification questions, then making comments in the Ullman "if this were my dream..." style. At each step, the dreamer had a chance to respond if he or she wished. Now on AOL, John uses a similar bulletin board style, and participants can anonymously post dreams and comments within the mediated process. His preliminary research indicates that the online groups provide as much or more insight than face-to-face groups. Generally he attributes this to the reflective, unpressured time that dreamer and respondents have to make comments. </p>

<p>I took this process back to the Electric Dreams community, modified it for e-mail and have been trying out variations for about a year. The first were round-robins, where we had one file and a list of participants. The file was passed around with the next addresses of where to send the file. As the growing file passed through the mediator and dreamer, the next phase was enacted; from dream presentation, to clarification questions, to replies and comments. It was an administrative nightmare. We switched to a process suggested by Jay Vinton to simply have everyone maintain the group list and send each comment or reply to everyone else on the list. This has worked pretty well and if the continually positive and enthusiastic comments received from the dreamers at the end of the process continue, the two week group mail list will become a permanent fixture to the Electric Dreams community.</p>

<p>The two week Post-and-Comment style dreamsharing is still a part of Electric Dreams and recently I added a special mail list distribution and communication channel to facilitate this. Interested subscribers join the list and can not only submit dreams, but discuss the dreams as well as comments and aspects of dream interpretation in general. Bob Krumhansl pulls all the relevant dialogues, dreams and comments together and we publish them for the whole community every two or three weeks.</p>

<p>Electric Dreams continues to be a kind of eye on Internet for dreamers and a forum for direct dreamsharing, education and news. But even more it is a swarm of mutant butterflies in Cyberspace, a community experimenting with dreamsharing at its core. New forms of dreamsharing appear every week and with the addition of new technologies, even more forms will soon be available.</p>

<h2>Technological Solution or Social Revolution?</h2>

<p>Many people are wary of the Internet and the promises of its being just the latest in a series of 19th and 20th Century technological solutions that end up causing more harm than good. I agree with this caution and feel the Net will probably bring with it more problems than solutions. Just like democracy and Rock &amp; Roll. I'm afraid it is already past the point of trying to pack it up and send it back to National Science Foundation. What we can do is become involved and shape the way that online interaction occurs. For example, just as with off-line dreamsharing, on line dreamsharing continues the valuing of inner resourcefulness, of intuitive perception, of supporting each person in being his or her own authority in matters of meaning and value and bringing those out into the community at large.</p>

<p>I don't mean to offer online dreamsharing as better than off-line. I'd rather not set up a feeling of competition here; I personally love the physical embodiments of dream drama and the risky emotional contact and personal closeness of face-to-face meetings. This is just not available at this time on the Net. Rather, I'd like to present online dreamsharing as something new, opening a new niche, a new wavelength that is different from face-to-face dream sharing. Online dreamsharing complements and supports all other kinds of dream sharing through the more specific development of reflective skills and more general global dissemination of the benefits of communities tied together through the sharing of dreams. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oppression in art, as in life, is when the conclusion to be reached is predetermined by inner or outer a priori motives of how life or art ought to be.</em> -Robert Motherwell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Civilization has posed a difficult task for the dreamer. Born into a society where dreams are of little or no social importance, the dreamer is left with few ways to satisfy a very natural curiosity to learn what the dream is saying. The result is a kind of emotional ecological loss to society, one in which so valuable a resource has gone unappreciated. Some day someone like Rachel Carson may come along to alert us to the price we are paying for this neglect. The repair will depend on the honesty with which we can face up to the general historical developments that have led up to this state of affairs and the current sociocultural forces that perpetuate it.</p>

<p>I won't say much about the general factors. They are well known to us all. Setting ourselves apart from nature our efforts have been devoted to a mastery over nature, including our own human nature. In savaging nature, we ourselves have become an endangered species, if not physically, then in terms of our obvious failure to nurture and cherish every human being that lands on this planet. Instead of facilitating a spirit of connectedness, without which we cannot endure as a species, our rugged individualism has left the devil to take the hindmost. Nationalism, having outlived its usefulness, now stands in the way of repairing the fragmentation the human species has been subjected to down through the ages. Our dreams and the concern they show for the state of our connectedness to others and to ourselves can make no claim of importance in this outworn scheme of things. They await a new day.</p>

<p>As individuals we cannot easily resolve any of these general issues in the near future. We can, however, do more with regard to the specific issues that make it difficult to open the closet door. There are a number of hidden assumptions that perpetuate this difficulty. For the most part they derive from the lingering influence of a mystique that has grown up about dreams as a consequence of the foothold that classical psychoanalysis established in this country in the thirties. With that came an ideology that cast the dream in a light that all but made it forbidden territory to the ordinary mortal. To undo this inhibitory impact we have to see it for what it is and take what steps we can to bring forth a new and more felicitous vision of the gift our dreaming psyche offers so freely.</p>

<p>Jung took the first step in this direction. The respect he showed to the dream freed it from its regressive prison, got rid of its jailor in the form of the censor, and made for its freer existence beyond the limiting domain of wish fulfillment. It is Jung's vision of the dream rather than Freud's that attracts the attention of the current generation of dream explorers. Erich Fromm accorded the language of the dream its full due. In a clear break with the way the dream was enmeshed in the Oedipus myth and other facets of Freudian theory, he viewed the imaging mode of the dream as a unique and distinctively human attribute that creatively reflected the psychological forces that impinge on our lives. Although paving the way toward a broader usage of the dream outside the framework of therapy, the steps necessary to implement that usage was a task for a later generation of dream workers.</p>

<p>In sum, the mystique of dreams in the mind of the public included the regressive view of the dream, the dream as the container of a cauldron of id impulses that threaten to erupt unless properly censored, the predominant role of wish fulfillment and sexuality, and finally, the need for someone psychoanalytically trained to interpret the resulting symbolism along tracks laid out by psychoanalytic theory. There have been major revisionist theories in psychoanalysis over the years that have moved away from the overarching role Freud attributed to instinctual drives and childhood wishes. These new approaches continued, however, to foster the cult of the expert and perpetuated the idea that formal therapy provided the only safe and effective way for the dreamer to engage with the dream. To challenge the premises underlying this mystique was to court danger. While theory may be helpful to a clinician as a way of highlighting trends in the developing life history of the patient, it can often be misused when it comes to dreams.</p>

<p>Viewing the metaphorical imagery in the framework of a particular theoretical orientation tends to foster an a priori approach to the imagery, the very thing Motherwell warns about.</p>

<p>The thrust of my professional endeavors for over three decades has been to do what I can to dismantle this mystique. In concert with a number of other workers I have addressed the general public concerning my conviction that access to dreams should be made available to all and I have suggested ways of approaching the task. The mystique I referred to is blind to the basic premise of this approach, namely, that dreaming is a universal phenomenon and should be universally accessible. It does not take into account the natural curiosity we all have about our dreams, a curiosity that betrays our intuitive sense that our dreams have something of importance to say to us. There is an active resistance by many therapists to what they correctly see as an attempt to deprofessionalize dream work. Having established a beachhead in the minds of the public that it requires an expert to decipher the symbolism of dreams, they have thus far been reluctant to forgo their privileged position.</p>

<p>If we were to project a utopian vision in which society were to give full cognizance to the healing potential of our dreams, what steps are within our power now to move toward that ideal? A first step would be to bring dream work into the educational system, beginning at the grade school level and making it an intrinsic part of the educational process at all levels. A few adventurous souls have experimented with this in the lower grades with encouraging results. I have had some experience with it at the high school level and, despite the special problems adolescents have about revealing their inner selves to their peers, I felt dream work was feasible and could be particularly helpful during this critical phase of development. Richard Jones pioneered a productive approach to dream work at the college level. In his book, The Dream Poet, he describes his experience of integrating what he refers to as "dream reflection" into a course on literature. As the students became familiar with the unique and expressive metaphors they were creating in their dreams, they not only responded more deeply to the classics they were reading, but their own writing became more original and more powerful than what might have been expected from their grade level (second year students). Similar work has been taken up at a number of different colleges. Edward Storm, a professor of computer science, brought dream work into a beginning course in computer science as a way of introducing students to the nonlinear analog attributes of dream thought. Important as these efforts are, they were nowhere on a scale commensurate with the educational potential that would accrue from an integration of dream work into the college curriculum.</p>

<p>It is time for the dreamers of the world to unite and break the theoretical chains that bind them to the cult of the expert and makes them passive participants in maintaining the mystique. What are dreamers being exhorted to do? First and foremost is to assume some responsibility to change the situation. This will involve both a program of education and of action.</p>

<p>Basic dream work should and can be taught outside of any particular theoretical frame of reference. I stress what I consider to be the three important phenomenological features of dreaming consciousness, namely, the relevance of its content to current issues in our lives, the retrieval of information from the past that is emotionally linked to these current concerns and finally, the profoundly honest way our feelings come through in the imagistic narrative we compose.</p>

<p>The dream presents a dreamer with the opportunity to move into the "becoming" aspect of his or her life. This entails certain unknowns and will often challenge a pre-existing emotional status quo. A dream, arising out of an unconscious domain, is now a challenge to the dreamer in the waking state. We are dealing with a raw product created primarily to meet the needs of the sleeping organism. A fish pulled out of the sea has to be cooked. A dream surfacing in the waking state has to be worked on for its message to be brought to life. For this the dreamer needs help in the form of a supportive and stimulating social context. That help is needed in the translation of the pictorial language and needs support in the owning of its content. Few of us can be as consistently honest with ourselves in the waking state as we are when we confront the imagery of the dream. Dream work flourishes in a group arrangement where everyone, including the leader, participates in every aspect of the process, including the sharing of dreams. A flat, nonhierarchical structure results. This, in conjunction with the fact that the dreamer is respected as the guardian of his or her unconscious and is the sole determinant of the level of self-disclosure, generates the sense of trust essential to the pursuit of so intimate and private an experience.</p>

<p>One way to approach understanding dreaming consciousness is to consider the way it differs from waking consciousness in both the language or form of the mode of communication and the nature of the content being communicated. The form is strikingly different from our waking thoughts. We move into a concrete sensory mode predominantly but not exclusively visual, and endow the imagery with the metaphorical power to reflect the subjective aspects of current concerns. We spend a good part of our sleeping time manufacturing visual metaphors that tell us how we really feel about ourselves, about others and about the immediate predicament we find ourselves in. If we are able to spark across the metaphorical gap and retrieve this content while awake, we become more truly in touch with ourselves. Our nighttime images are perceived as real at the moment. Their metaphorical power comes to light only when we take the time to explore their reference to our life. The waking discovery of the relevant life experience completes the metaphor.</p>

<p>Let us look more closely at the language of the dream. Once we free a dream from any extrinsic and superimposed theoretical considerations we are free to examine that imagistic language in its pristine state. When we go to sleep we shift from discursive speech to what I have referred to as metaphorical imagery in motion. We adopt the persona of the poet in a way that reflects the idiosyncratic emotional currents and express them not in words but in images that are uniquely our own. Regardless of how uncreative we may consider ourselves to be in our waking lives, the poet in each of us comes to life when we are asleep and dreaming. Unlike the poet who rearranges words in the search for the apt metaphor, we pictorially rearrange bits and pieces of our past experience and cultural heritage. We create visual metaphors that speak so precisely and so eloquently to whatever it is that we are feeling at the time.</p>

<p>The dream, in effect, is an aesthetic response to our predicament. I do not mean to imply that a dream is a work of art despite the fact that many dream images may be intrinsically beautiful and could become a work of art were they to be transformed into one or another enduring medium of expression. A work of art involves a good deal of energy and effort, sometimes extending over periods of time before it comes together in any final form. By way of contrast, the final product, the dream, appears spontaneously. No self-consciously directed energies are involved. It appears as part of a natural rhythm that occurs during sleep, a rhythm rooted in evolutionary processes. Once the dream is made to reveal its secret, its own internal logic becomes obvious. Then, and only then, can we appreciate how directly and precisely apropos it is as a carrier of immediate felt concerns.</p>

<p>In using the term secret, I do not wish to imply that a dream always has a secret to reveal. Sometimes it is quite transparent. There are many instance when solutions to problems and inventive ideas appear in a dream and are grasped immediately. More often than not the dreamer, on awakening, has only a limited access to his or her own creation, and sometimes none at all.. The greater our sense of metaphor, the more we might be able to connect with the imagery. The difficulty does not lie in the metaphorical language per se but, rather, in what that language is saying. Awake, we are not always as prone to the same level of honesty as we are while dreaming. As actors in the social scene, our unconscious defenses take over in the interest of maintaining our social persona. While awake, expediency often replaces candor in our efforts to protect a self-image. We have ways of not seeing what we don't wish to see. While dreaming we see what is really there to be seen.</p>

<p>The REM or rapid eye-movement stage of sleep and the associated episodes of dreaming are anything but a phylogenetic atrophic remnant like the appendix. By exposing predicaments arising defensively out of expediency or simply out of ignorance, this unique form of consciousness sounds a clear moral tone. Were we to take seriously the need to learn how to close the gap between image and reality we could benefit from the truth being exposed. Dreams are an ally in the effort to extend our range of moral freedom in the choices we are called upon to make.</p>

<p>Here I have to turn to moral philosophy for help. The point of view I have found most congenial in sorting out the issues involved is that of Mary Midgley. If I read her correctly, she buttresses common sense (it is in our nature to want to be more moral than otherwise) with Darwin's theory of evolution. She rejects any fatalistic view of human nature and links freedom to morality but not in any idealistic sense. Moral choice is contextual and linked to the specific circumstances and constraints in which that choice arises. The important point is that the choice is always there whether we know it or not. The constraints arise out of our individual life history and endure to the extent they are reinforced by existing social and institutional arrangements.</p>

<p>I am, in effect, postulating that we all possess an incorruptible core of being that makes its presence felt while dreaming, more dependably than while awake. I have referred to it as an ethical aperture, likening it to the aperture of a camera which opens more widely in the dark (asleep and dreaming). The aperture itself cannot ensure a good picture, but if properly set it allows for the best possible picture to emerge given the circumstances under which the picture is taken. Analogously our dream enables us to discern more clearly the circumstances involved and degree of freedom we have in making a moral choice. The dream aperture automatically sets itself to provide the information needed to ferret out the most moral choice available. It is up to us to develop the picture and do the work necessary to become conscious of that choice. The dream itself cannot make us do it. Our dreams are not enforcers.</p>

<p>Dreams have a range that takes into account the fact that the individual is a point of concentration of a complicated array of social forces, many of which operate outside of awareness. Just as personal referents in the dream reflect issues unique to the dreamer, social referents reflect issues that remain unsolved in a given society. Racism, sexism, ageism and other isms are still with us. Swept under the rug, they find their way into our dreams.</p>

<p>In the following example a blatantly sexist childhood casts a long shadow:</p>

<p>A woman in her late thirties is about to embark on a new relationship. She feels some hesitancy and has a dream that displays some of the roots of her ambivalence. At one point in the dream she sees her father sitting on a swing with four female relatives, all in their heyday, dressed almost like cancan girls. What emerged from the dream work were two powerful memories that surfaced from her childhood to influence her approach to a new relationship. One was that of the male, derived from the image of her father, as privileged to flirt and play around with other women. The other was that of the female victimized by the profligate male, as her mother was. These are images that she is still struggling with. In a larger sense they relate to the residues of sexism. The privileged male and the victimized female are still available social stereotypes.</p>

<p>In the next example the dreamer identifies with the victims of racism in her own struggle against sexism. A very experienced and competent manager, her voice is rarely heard by the men above her.</p>

<p>Irma is a 50 year old white woman who presented a dream, the key features of which were that she was with a group of children and an African-American mother on a bus in which she tried out one of the seats in the back. A little boy was speaking to a man. His black mother was angry because she didn't want her black boy speaking with a white man who would be a bad influence.</p>

<p>Irma's thoughts centered around her identification with the strong black mother. Her recent relevant day residues arose out of events at her work place. She is in a middle management position. "Those above me have all the arrogance of 'the old boys club'".</p>

<p>Women were second class citizens in her childhood home, controlled by a very dominant father whose strict religious teachings drew a very sharp line between right and wrong. That line was more favorable to her brothers than to her.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my workplace I felt like the underdog. If I `speak up' maybe I will eventually learn that a strong voice will not always be perceived by men as aggressive. Being born 'black' I had to have the ability to contain myself and still struggle to maintain my self respect and respect for my ideas. I have felt an affinity to black women all my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deeply felt mesh of the personal and the social was laid bare by the image of her taking a seat in the back of the bus. A current issue at work led back to her life long struggle to free her intelligence and spirit from the limiting structure of her family life as set down by her father. Her growing self-confidence enabled her to take a step that not only upset a given status quo, but led to her resignation and a successful venture on her own.</p>

<p>The identification of the social referents in their specific relevance to a recent issue at work makes the connection between the social and the personal explicit and reciprocal. The connection becomes reciprocal when insight into the social scene sets in motion the hope of coping with her own disenfranchisement. In her ruminations about the dream in the week after she presented it, she felt the plight of the African-American woman on the bus was a "parable for my entire life experience, oppressed as it was by the strict regime my father and his religious beliefs imposed on me."</p>

<p>Irma's final comment was about her identification with the black woman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like the idea that came up that I was born a black woman. It goes beyond the events of the past week. It goes back to my relationship with my father.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the extent we remain unaware of the power of such internalized prejudices, our moral freedom is compromised. Any threat to moral freedom is ultimately a threat to enduring and collaborative ties among the constituents of a given order. We are members of a species that has survived thus far by virtue of our social attributes. If those attributes continue to deteriorate and we fail to reverse the moral morass growing so alarmingly at a community, national and international level, we are in for a difficult time in ever unifying the human species.</p>

<p>Our dreams thus serve a dual purpose. Their personal referents speak to the emotional baggage we carry around from our childhood. The social referents speak to the way certain social arrangements and institutions constrain our lives. One of the pitfalls common to industrial societies is the tendency to reduce human beings to objects, the personal attributes of which are useful in the marketplace. In the wake of recent examples of corporate psychopathy, workers thrown out of work come to the sudden realization they are no more than disposable objects.</p>

<p>In the following example, this "objectifying" trend is played out in the sexual life of a young woman:</p>

<p>When a woman dreams of a reference to her sexual organs as a head of lettuce encased in the empty shell of a cantaloupe sitting on the shelf of a supermarket she is saying something about her own personal sexual problem (frigidity) and, at the same time, making a statement about an aspect of social life. The personal referents arouse our interest, but the social referents are generally not pursued to any great degree. Briefly, the personal referents are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sexual organs are seen as separate from her functioning self.</p></li>
<li><p>Sexual organs are seen as objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The object is made of completely closed leaves encased in a shell.</p></li>
<li><p>The objects can be bought and sold.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an anonymity to objects on the shelf of a supermarket.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The real-life situation to which this symbolism alludes may be noted as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Involvement in a situation of incipient sexual activity that occurred apart from her own will and intent and at the instigation of her husband.</p></li>
<li><p>Reactions of irritation, guilt, and constraint.</p></li>
<li><p>A resolution through pseudo-acquiescence and preparatory sexual activity involving the use of a diaphragm.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The social referents may be similarly noted:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We live in a society where the capacities of people are sometimes treated as objects divorced from the person: labor, brains, beauty, talent, sex.</p></li>
<li><p>These separated capacities are bought and sold.</p></li>
<li><p>The exchange value and laws of the marketplace tend to make the transaction automatic and impersonal.</p></li>
<li><p>There exists in the nature of the external referents a detachment or separation of the individual from the commodity she is called upon to use. Her real relation to the commodity is determined by its manifest elements — the object exists as something apart from herself which may or may not be purchased.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our own humanity thrives best in an atmosphere of affectionate and cooperative ties to others. Dreams provide us with an opportunity to explore, understand and change whatever may be in the way of establishing such ties. In this respect I believe our dreaming consciousness goes beyond a concern for the individual and arises out of a more basic concern, namely, the survival of the species. One of the unfortunate byproducts of the historical evolution of human society is the enormous fragmentation that has occurred among members of the human species and the terrible tensions that have been associated with this fragmentation. We need only mention, as examples, religious, racial, sexual and economic class distinctions, in addition to accidents of geographical separation and differentials in cultural evolution.</p>

<p>While as individuals we may concern ourselves very little with the integrity of our connections with others, pursue an unsavory way of life, run roughshod over others and still live to a ripe old age, it is becoming more and more unlikely that we will survive as a species unless we can get our act together and learn how to surmount the historical fragmentation that has occurred. Dreams can provide us with one more tool in the struggle to repair and maintain that sense of species-connectedness so essential for our survival.</p>

<p>What is needed at present is a drastic revision of our view of the importance of our dream life. Dreams are very low in the list of social priorities. We do not introduce dream work into the family or educational system. As adults we are left to our own devices to satisfy our natural curiosity about our dreams. The only socially sanctioned arrangement for dream work is the therapeutic situation where we pay someone to help us with our dreams. All of us are dreamers and not all of us need therapy. Where can the rest of us go? Dream dictionaries? They are more often misleading than helpful.</p>

<p>The knowledge and skills necessary for effective and safe dream work can be identified and taught to anyone with sufficient interest. There is a growing awareness that this is so and that the time has come to open the door to the lay public. Were dream work to be socially upgraded and the proper arrangements made for extending it into the community we would not only provide the individual with a vehicle for personal growth but we might also catch a glimpse of the underside of our own social order and its emotional impact on each of our lives.</p>

<p>Cultural anthropologists have looked at dreams as mirroring aspects of primitive societies. We have hardly begun to scrutinize the influence of our own social order on our dreams. Were we to do so, I believe that interesting relationships would emerge. In preliterate societies today, for example, there is a niche for dreams as an important intermediary between cultural, religious, and historical influences on everyday life. In antiquity, notably classical Greece, this interest in dreams was also noted. In both instances, there was a certain symmetry between the personal and the social that served a unifying, cohesive function. The situation began to change in ancient Rome as monotheism took over. The link was finally severed in western Europe in the middle ages with the occurrence of two historical developments, the invention of the printing press and the consolidation of the power of the Church. The first made dream books, mostly oriented to mantic practices and divination, available to the laity. The second resulted in disparaging even to the point of proscribing the circulation of such books. In the eyes of the Church, mystical visions and dreams were linked.</p>

<p>Both could be the work of either divine or satanic influences. Since the laity could fall prey to the latter, it was felt that dreams and visions should remain under the domain of the Church as the only power that could vouch for authentic divine influences. This concern with the vulnerability of the laity to demonic influences ultimately led to the persecution of witches.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution marginalized dreams. It was the last blow to any hope that our dream life would find its own natural haven in society. Objective mastery of the external world far outstripped any realistic social investment in the subjective mastery of ourselves. Dreams had no significant social valence. With Freud the universal phenomenon of dreaming found a limited place for itself in a profession dedicated to the art of psychological healing. The public was left to shift for itself with regard to their dreams. Universal accessibility to something so insistently a part of everyone's life has remained a mirage for all but a handful of oneirophiles. In the laboratory we have learned how to deprive people of dreams by keeping them awake from the onset to the end of the successive stages of the dreaming cycle. Without giving it a second thought, we have managed to live out our lives in a dream-deprived society.</p>

<p>The closing decades of the last century witnessed the appearance of a truly new phenomenon, namely, people gravitating toward dream groups led both by professionals, including a scattering of psychoanalytically trained therapists, and laity. While at this point these groups are only barely visible dots on the landscape, there is every indication that this movement will grow. That growth will depend on how safe and effective these groups turn out to be. Currently, there are more people seeking such groups than there are groups to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Every member of our species is a dreamer. If dream work had a higher social valence than it now enjoys, might it, in the way it addresses the micro-level of individual relatedness, make a contribution toward remedying relatedness within the family and the community? Once dreaming consciousness is more generally recognized as constructively complementary to waking consciousness, and were that complementarity ever to gain a foothold in the public domain, it just might open up one more pathway to a more humane social order. There have been and still are societies that have integrated dream work into their culture.</p>

<p>In sum, our dreams, when consciously pursued, are a kind of emotional connective tissue bonding us as social animals. If we take the trouble to permit those nocturnal visitations to find their place in our waking world, they can provide us with a starting point in the continuing struggle to transcend our limitations. The nature of our interdependence is such that, as personal connections evolve more solidly, there are effects that reverberate upward toward ever larger social units. Dreams can point us in the right direction. They reveal our strengths, acknowledge our weaknesses, expose our deceits, and liberate our creativity. They deserve far greater attention than they now receive. As a psychiatrist, my concern is with personal truth. One road I have taken in pursuit of this has been to attempt to demystify dreams in a way that would make the personal honesty embedded in the metaphorical images of our dreams available to all. There should be universal access to the benefits that can accrue from them.</p>

<p>For too long the public has been taken in by the prevailing mystique that serious dream work had best be limited to the clinical domain. Our dreaming psyche arises out of an incorruptible core that, in contrast to our waking ego, has never lost sight of the fact that we are members of a single species. Our ability to endure as a species may depend on taking that fact more seriously than we have in the past. Dreams reveal the state of connectedness of the individual to his or her past, to others, and to the supports and constraints of the social order. Is it too much to hope that, as we move into a postindustrial society, the intrinsic honesty of dreams can be harnessed to this effort?</p>

<p>We are in need of a politics of connectedness. The growing interest in the healing potential of our dream life holds out the hope we may eventually reach the goal of matching our biological unity as a species with a cultural reality of communion and brotherhood. My point is not that dreams will save us from ultimate disaster but they can, if taken seriously, be one among many countervailing efforts.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>What? The president of an international dream association is telling us not to interpret our dreams? Banish him to the tower immediately!</em></p>

<p>Wait! Let me explain. </p>

<p>When referring to dreamwork, I have trouble with the term, “interpretation,” as it implies determination of a finite “meaning” and we all know dreams carry multiple meanings. I don’t think the purpose of dreamwork is interpretation, but many people come to dream groups expecting their dream to be “interpreted,” suggesting that there is just one explanation for the dream – and that the dream is meant just for them. </p>

<p>In an open dream group I led in Asheville, North Carolina people dropped in and shared dreams that amazed and perplexed them. Of course the next words out of their mouths were, “What does it mean?” The group would spend the next hour or so laboriously “working” each dream and the dreamer usually left with some degree of satisfaction in regard to what the dream was about. That was the conclusion of their experience. </p>

<p>Most of these people had little interest in learning how to work on their own dreams such as starting a journal or studying their dream history. They represent many who have dreams that pique their curiosity, but would prefer others to tell them what they mean. Some are even willing to pay a few dollars to an “expert” or skim through a dream dictionary to gain insight. </p>

<p>When doing dreamwork, I prefer the term, “exploration.” I see our roles as dream facilitators or group members as ones who explore a dream in an effort to help the dreamer attain self-discovery. In group settings, exploration is magnified and multiplied. When shared, one person’s dream does not belong to that person alone but takes on its own life within each member of the group.</p>

<p>I tell my groups that a dream is brand new when it occurs in sleep and is again brand new when it is told. Each person hearing it is creating a version of the dream and it is no longer one dream, but many. In other words there is a new dream being dreamed at that moment by each person in the room as well as each person in their families, co-workers or social network friends – and each one grows from the insight of the one dream captured by one person. </p>

<p>In effect, we are not interpreting a dream, but we are opening up multitudes of possibilities for the dreamers exposed to it. I don’t call my groups dream analysis or dream interpretation groups, but rather dream study groups. We study. We explore. We experience the dream. And we each benefit from that experience. </p>

<p>Every person who hears a dream becomes a facilitator; one who serves the dreamer by listening and attempting to understand the aspects of the dream without projecting or “interpreting” it for the dreamer. During the process the veils of confusion are removed and both the dreamer and the facilitator begin to appreciate the blessings the dream has to offer. </p>

<p>To avoid projection and the danger of “telling” someone what a dream means when providing personal insight, many dreamworkers begin with the phrase, “If this were my dream....” That is, if this were my dream it would have this or that meaning or this symbol would mean such and such to me. In order to totally avoid the possibility of projection I prefer, “In my version of the dream …” By saying this, I take ownership of the dream and am less likely to project based on prior knowledge I may have of the dreamer. In this respect I am more likely to deal solely with the dream itself. </p>

<p>During a dinner party in my home, a woman at the table told an incredible dream about sheep. When she was done, everyone looked at me, as if they expected me to immediately know what the dream “meant.” Knowing my in-depth involvement with dreams, they expected me to be an “expert.” I told them I didn’t have the slightest idea what that dream meant. I took solace remembering an incident Robbie Bosnak wrote about in his book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>. As I recall, after a client of his told a dream, he broke into a cold sweat acknowledging to himself that he didn’t have any idea what it meant. I felt comforted knowing that this man, who does dreamwork for a living, goes through the same anxiety I do when expected to “interpret” a dream. </p>

<p>When first told, the dream is a mystery. Its meaning is as unknown to the listener as it is to the dreamer. But as we venture into that unknown, peeling away layer after layer, examining the details, identifying the characters and action sequences of the story - exploring deeper and deeper - the messages the dream is attempting to convey become apparent. For instance, as I delve into a dream about a bear invading my camping space, I may see it as asking me to think about how I deal with conflict or potential conflict, what choices I am making (such as facing fear or running away) or simply how I deal with unexpected consequences. Perhaps all are true. Ultimately, I come to realize there is no fi nite meaning, but infi nite possibilities. </p>

<p>Instead of using the terms dream interpretation or analysis, I support exploration. By steering away from what a dream “means,” (since all dreams have multiple meanings), we can embrace what the dream is asking us to do - to face the critical issues in our lives so we can advance and grow. They ask us the questions we need to address, and rather than giving us direct answers, they guide us to the next question. If we just decide, “this dream means this or that,” we are likely to just say, “Since I know what that dream means, I don’t need to explore it any further,” and we fail to experience the full richness of the dream. </p>

<p>Analysis leads to knowledge. True wisdom comes from being in a space of “not knowing.” ℘ </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center; margin: auto"><i> Many visitors to the National Mall found themselves drawn magnetically to the drumming. Here, children from a local YMCA summer camp program try out the drums.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>Dream Network Journal editor, <a href="../@robertaossana">Roberta Ossana</a>, calls this kind of event “The intersection between dreams and waking.” In my mind’s eye, I picture two planes intersecting, a point where dreaming becomes waking reality. Drum Dance and Dream for Peace was such an event, growing out of the fertile soil of dreams on the World Dreams Peace Bridge as surely as roses climb a trellis.</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, June 25, on the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 200 people (over half of them children) joined in a drumming circle that began in the light of a dream. Over a year before the event that she was asked to create for The World Children’s Festival, Mary Whitefeather Joyce dreamed of standing in a circle in a grassy place, drumming with a group of mostly children. Even earlier, the dreams of other members of the Peace Bridge had foreshadowed this scene. </p>

<p>On the Mall, the Ceremony for the Future of the World’s Children, foreseen and described by the Native elder Wovoka, was led by Valley Reed of Dallas, Texas. She introduced the Ceremony from the World Stage, leading the children to a grassy area outside the stage enclosure. Later she said: “The song I played on my flute came to me in my dreams the night before, and played all night long. I played the song on my Native American Flute and led the children to the blessing ceremony where we made offerings of prayers with wild rice, Indian corn, sage, and tobacco for the future of the children of the World.” </p>

<p>The Ceremony, like the Festival itself, was about children expressing themselves. During the Ceremony each child, wearing a headband of one of the colors of the four direction, said a prayer from the heart for the children of the world: for clean air, plenty of food for everyone, pure water, peace. </p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin: auto"><i>Hundreds of people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC and globally in over a dozen locations to Drum Dance and Dream for Peace on June 25, 2007. This event, part of the World Children’s Festival, was inspired by dreams.</i></div>

<p>Then the drumming began. People came from everywhere, drawn by their own dreams and visions for peace. From New Jersey came Sharon Silverstein with her 20 djimbes; her friend Bernadette; and a bag full of bells, triangles, shakiras and other sound makers—Sharon, who told me the day I met her on the telephone, “I have to come. It’s crazy, but I have to come, and I want to lead the drumming circle.” </p>

<p>An entire convoy of moms, with as many children as they could pack into their vans, drove from southern Virginia, where they camped out on the lawn of a friend’s home in nearby Woodbridge, before taking the subway next day to the Mall. For many of the kids, it was their first trip to the nation’s capitol. </p>

<p>On the faces of the people drumming, it was possible to read the dreams of many nations. Two Muslim mothers, heads covered, held their babies up to pat the djimbes. One well dressed matron from Chile, a participant in the Festival, whirled ecstatically in her electric blue dress, hand drum held high above her head, remarked after the drumming was over, “I think I’ve found a new career!” </p>

<p>Scores of the tourists who flock to the museums on the Mall during the summer were lured by the sound of the drums. From UpBeat Drum Circles in Los Angeles we had received a donation of forty hand drums of various sizes. I went around the circle handing out drums to those who had none. One elderly Chinese couple, having had their fill of drumming tried to hand their drum circles back to me. “No,” I told them. “You can keep them.” </p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin: auto"><i>In the High Sierras in California, members of the Rainbow Medicine Blanket Council made ceremony with the World Drum, which traveled from Norway by way of Hawaii on its way around the world sounding out for Peace Children’s Festival, held June 25, 2007, on the Mall.</i></div>

<p>A smile lit the woman’s face. “Souvenir?” “Yes. Souvenir.” She tucked the two drums into her oversized black handbag as they strolled off down the Mall. </p>

<p>The beatific smiles on the faces of the children, caught up in the joy of pounding the beat, made months of work worthwhile. After the drumming was over and the drums were being loaded back into the van, an elderly homeless man, one of many who frequent the Mall, stayed on in the circle, sitting with a borrowed djimbe, demonstrating African rhythms to a cluster of teenagers. </p>

<p>From Seoul, South Korea with his daughter Eloisa, Jeremy Seligson not only discovered that the young woman organizing the Festival workshops was his neighbor from Seoul (no kidding), but Jeremy was carrying a dream of his own. </p>

<p>Jeremy, who dreamed the original Peace Train dream (the train he rode on bore the banner “Peace Train” traveled across America to Washington) had come to Washington not only to drum, dance and dream, but to conduct a Peace Train Workshop for the Festival. </p>

<p>“Although our Children’s Peace Train workshop was scheduled for only one hour,” Jeremy wrote the next day in his ‘Children’s Peace Train Report from Washington, DC’, “it went on for three. From the very beginning there was a steady stream of children with their parents and even one whole class of 21 little students from DC and their teachers coming in to sit in waves at the work table and draw a picture of peace in their lives.” </p>

<p>Jeremy brought along copes of his newly completed <em>Children’s Peace Train</em> book, which he distributed to participants in the workshop. His comment? ”Now the Children’s Peace Train really has come to WA. DC.” Of course, Washington was not the only site of Drum Dance and Dream for Peace, in either dreaming or waking reality. Beginning on Saturday, June 23, from Mexico to Canada, from California to Rhode Island, from Boston to Baghdad, people were drumming for peace around the globe. </p>

<p>In Mexico City a small group of women made an altar of fresh flowers and photos of their children. They passed the drum, saying aloud their prayers for peace for the children. In Warwick, Rhode Island, <a href="../@lauraatkinson">Laura Atkinson</a> (who earlier in the week had dreamed that Peace Bridge member May Tung who died last year came to remind her to buy extra materials for the workshop) led children at the Warwick Museum in a drum making workshop. </p>

<p>In Noe Valley, California, Jill Pierce led free drumming classes for children all day long at the Music 4 All center there. </p>

<p>In the high Sierras in California, members of the Rainbow Medicine Blanket Council made ceremony with the World Drum, which began last year in Norway and has been traveling to drum circles around the world to drum Jean Campbell from the World Dreams Peace Bridge calls people to the drumming circle with one of 40 drums donated by UpBeat Drum Circles in Los Angeles, to be given away on the Mall. for peace. The World Drum came via Hawaii, and was traveling to PA. </p>

<p>Drum Dance and Dream for Peace had the magical feeling of dreams, a place in which anything can happen. At Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts, Professor Curt Hoffman who’d met with a small group of drummers at the sacred site which was the site of the solstice drumming circle at the 2006 IASD Conference, was surprised when they were joined in drumming for the children by an entire Physical Education class, out for a hike. </p>

<p>In the one day of Drum Dance and Dream for Peace, donations to the 1,000 Drums Project, funds being collected for the refugee children of Iraq, doubled. One night, shortly after the photographs from Drum Dance and Dream for Peace were put up on the World Dreams web site, I had the following dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>As I watch, each of the photos from the slide show created for the web site individually floats above a section in an energy grid that surrounds the Capitol building at the end of the National Mall. One by one the slides hover, and then project their pixels into the ground below, sinking slowly into football-field size grid sections until the image appears on the ground before the Capitol. I wake while watching one specific photograph do this. It is the photo of a young boy playing one of the djimbes. He is totally caught up in the music, blissfully enjoying the beat of the drum, oblivious to anything else.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I wrote to the Peace Bridge group list, “It is hard to drop bombs on children when teaching them the joy of music.” </p>

<p>It is truly a pleasure and a privilege to be here tonight. This is a very new experience for me, so please be patient as I get adjusted to being up here.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I'd like to thank all of the people who have encouraged me.  I'm not going to mention names, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the dreamers, writers, artists, poets, previous editors, everybody who has helped to keep the spirit that manifests as the publication Dream Network alive over the past 14 and a half years. Quite honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed a bit right now. I have “as has been true with Will” known many of you for so long and yet am just tonight meeting you in person for the first time.  Additionally, I've never done anything like this before.  This is a first time, initiatory, trial-by-fire experience, and I ask your patience and your good energy.  And if you give that to me, you may be in for a little show, because I have a tendency to speak as much with my hands and my body as I do with my voice. So c'mon, I'll provide you with some entertainment!</p>

<p>I want to begin tonight by sharing a piece that was given to me by a poet friend some years ago.  It was a piece read at a meeting of the New Latin American Poets in Mexico City some time ago. The author is unknown.  But it's a piece that I believe holds the essence of the spirit of the dream movement, and is a credo that we've adopted among those people who are networkers within the context of the Dream Network.  I then want to spend the majority of the time introducing those of you who aren't familiar with the publication and its history... to Dream Network by introducing previous editors and sharing a little bit about what we've been doing over the past 14 and a half years. I will conclude by sharing a piece that I've written about dreams and exploring the mystery.  So to begin, I will read, if I may,</p>

<h2>A Message to Poets and Dreamers</h2>

<p>"We who are poets and dreamers know that the reason for a poem is not discovered until the poem itself exists.  The reason for a living act is realized only in the act itself.  This meeting is a spontaneous explosion of hopes.  That is why it is a venture in prophetic poverty, supported and financed by no foundation, organized and publicized by no official group, but a living expression of the belief that there are now in our world new people, new poets, new dreamers, who are not in tutelage to established political systems or cultural structures, but who dare to hope in their own vision of reality and of the future...</p>

<p>"This meeting is united in a flame of hope whose temperature has not yet been taken, and whose effects have not yet been estimated, because it is a new fire.  The reason for the fire cannot be apparent to one who is not warmed by it.  The reason for being here will not be found until all have walked together, without afterthought, into contradictions and possibilities...</p>

<p>"We believe our future will be made by love and hope, not by violence or calculation.  The Spirit that has brought us together, whether in space or only in agreement, will make our encounter an epiphany of certainties we could not know in isolation...</p>

<p>"The solidarity of poets and dreamers is not planned and welded together with tactical convictions or matters of policy, since these are affairs of prejudice, cunning, and design.  Whatever our failures, the poet and dreamer is not a cunning person.   His or her art depends on an ingrained innocence which he or she would lose in business, in politics, or in too organized a form of academic life.  The hope that rests on calculation has lost its innocence.  Let us band together to protect our innocence!" (end ‘Credo’)</p>

<p>That is called again, "A Message to Poets," author unknown, but very relevant, I believe, to the challenge that stands before us as we create new ways of recognizing that so many of the ways that we've been taught are not working for us any longer.</p>

<h2>History of Dream Network/Past Editors</h2>

<p>Now I want to talk about what I know of the history of the Dream Network.  There are many details that I don't know.  I was fortunate to be able to make contact with most of the previous editors and get statements from them and I'll be sharing those.  But, in essence, I do know that the publication was started with an intention to bring dreams back to dreamers, to acknowledge the fact that we've learned that we all dream every night, and that we have a right to learn, to understand, the symbolic and metaphoric language of dreams.  It was begun in the spirit of being a grassroots publication and it's remained that way over the past 14+ years.  And it couldn't have happened without, as Will said, the dedication and effort that so many people have put into it over the years.  At this point, if we could have the house lights out, we'd like to show a few slides to show the evolution of the publication over the years.</p>

<p>Dream Network was begun in January 1982 by a very fiery and compassionate young man by the name of Bill Stimson.  And I'd like to read... That's his picture there and that's the first issue of Dream Network.  And, in that issue he published an article that he wrote called, "Armed with our Dreams." I'd like to read just the last paragraph of that article:</p>

<p>"Armed with our dreams, we have a weapon that can turn this society upside down by turning our lives around.  The greatest battles waged throughout history have been within the souls of a few brave men and women.  To work with dreams in the deepest sense is to be a leader in the revolution of human consciousness."</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote Bill and asked him if he'd be willing to share a few words and he was aware that I was going to be making this presentation.</p>

<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>

<p><em>"The Dream Network is not the publication; the enterprise proper isn't a publishing one. To speak the truth of what the Dream Network is about for us is to find our myth -- where else but among our dreams? -- for us to use our dreams in a way that enables us to come together honestly and deeply, for what was broken to be rendered whole again, our community with one another, our connection with our deeper selves, our oneness in purpose, our ability and our resolve to embody the light itself. What makes the Dream Network special is that it's fundamentally different.  People sense this somehow and so they've helped the energy and unfoldment move forward."</em></p>

<p>During Bill's time (and if you'd please show the next two slides, Will)... I don't understand the dynamics that were behind this, but there were different publications coming out in different parts of the country that were called Dream Network affiliate publications.  One of them was called Fusion.  I believe it came out of Seattle.  And there was another called DreamCraft, which came out of somewhere in the northeast.  I'm not certain about that, however.  There was a big stir of energy happening at that time.  One of my advisors and a very, very good friend, who is one that I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting in the flesh, is Barbara Shore.  And she was a part of the original New York dream community.  I wrote her and asked if she'd share some of her experiences from those early days. I think this might sound familiar to a lot of you because, I know in my own experience, when I first began having these incredible dreams, I didn't have too many places to turn and there wasn't a lot of information available to help me understand what was happening.  What Barbara has to say is,</p>

<p><em>"In my mind's eye is Bill Stimson's small, walk-up flat on a hot summer's night...the beginnings of the New York dream community.  We never formed a tight-knit group because the people kept changing too often for that.  The room was usually crowded...15 to 20 people.  Essentially, we knew nothing about dreams, but Bill's enthusiasm and passion for dreams was contagious. It was a dream whose time had come, like the classic dream of finding yourself in your own home but entering a new room that you've never been in before.  We were electrified.  This group was the core of the New York dream community and the New York dream community was the core of the early dream movement in the United States.  Although we couldn't articulate it at the time, I think we realized that we now had a mission in life. We were converts to dreams.  Was it Bill's vision of a global network of dreamers we were envisioning or did it arise spontaneously among us?  I don't know, but it was powerful.  When Bill got an idea, he didn't rest until he got it out there.  He was the prototype of the populist networker, the Trotsky of the dream revolution. It might have happened without him, but it never would have been so fast, so intense, so like a prairie fire in a season of drought.  Maybe this was the next step after the revolutionary 60's.  That world-changing vision hadn't fully worked, so maybe we had to go back to the inner drawing board, and remake the world from the individual psyche's infrastructure inside out, instead of the other way around."</em></p>

<p>Bill did the Dream Network; he was at that time putting it out monthly. It was a four to eight page bulletin.  And he did that for approximately two years, at which time it came into the hands and heart of Chris Hudson.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't contact...I couldn't locate Chris, so I don't have anything to share with you directly from him.  But I did meet him in my early days of work with the Dream Network, and want to share some of that meeting with you a little later on.  For this purpose, I'll say that I did get letters from people who have been long-time readers who made a lot of comments about their appreciation of Chris's willingness to share his own process, to share his own dreams during the years that he was editor and publisher.  And they also appreciated the very lively Letters to the Editor section that he introduced into the publication.</p>

<p>Chris was in Brooklyn and Henry and <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Bob Van De Castle</a> are the people who took responsibility for the publication next, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>

<p>Once again I don't know any of the dynamics that occurred when the publication was making its moves around the country. But Henry and Bob have shared that even before the Dream Network appeared on the scene, Henry had published several issues of the "Sundance Community Dream Journal," which was the precursor to the Dream Network.  It was the first published journal declaring that dreams belong to dreamers.  The Sundance Journal and Henry's early efforts have had him dubbed "The Father of the American Dream Movement" in many circles.  Henry and his wife, along with Bob Van De Castle, took responsibility for the Dream Network in 1985, and during that time, Bob conducted a very successful dream telepathy experiment through the publication.  And Henry did a real interesting study on shoes as symbols in dreams.  Articles and his findings were published throughout the time that he and Bob were doing this.  I'm a little embarrassed and self-conscious because both Henry and Robert are sitting right here in front of me.  And I know that there are probably many things that I'm not saying. Would either of you like to make comments about your time? (Henry and Robert signal ‘no.’)</p>

<p>Okay. ... During the period of time that they were co-editing the publication, Bob was also serving as the president of ASD.</p>

<p>From their hands, in approximately 1987, it traveled into the hands and heart of Linda Magellon, here in nearby San Jose. Linda, who I don't believe is here tonight, (she said she had responsibilities elsewhere), had this to say,</p>

<p><em>"Dream Network Bulletin is a communal project.  It couldn't happen without the help of family, friends, and colleagues, without the assistance of volunteer staff, contributors, and subscribers.  Under my tutelage, the most important goal was to assure that new voices would be heard, new visions seen, especially those dreamers who'd not been previously published. They were nurtured and encouraged to dare to dream in the public forum."</em></p>

<p>Linda had a great deal of support as well from Bob Trowbridge and Jill Gregory, whom I know many of you are familiar with. It was during Linda's time that the publication first began to take on color. I think that if the right slide's up there, you're seeing the first issue that appeared with color on the cover.  </p>

<p>My Own History with Dream Network,</p>

<p>including a brief Dream autobiography</p>

<p>In 1989, literally on summer solstice, I was informed that the Bay Area Dream Workers had accepted my "bid," so to speak, to take responsibility for the publication.  And I'd like to go on kind of a diversionary path here for a moment and share a little with you about my history with dreams and my history with the Dream Network, because I recognize that I'm a stranger to most of you.  This is kind of a labyrinthical tale.  I hope you'll be able to follow along with me:</p>

<p>It starts back in 1975-76.  I was in a very, very busy part of my life, living in the Pacific northwest and working full time, raising my family, in a new marriage.  One afternoon on a weekend, I took a nap and had the most extraordinary dream that I'll probably ever have in my life. It is the first dream that I ever recall as an adult.  I remember dreams from my childhood but this one was like going to a full-length movie.  When I awakened, I went, "My goodness, what on earth was that?" I'd been keeping a journal for several years and I immediately wrote down every detail of that dream.  In the dream...</p>

<p>I found myself going into the community center where I was, actually where I actually worked, where my office was located.  It was a multi-service community center.  And rather than the typical kinds of activities that were taking place there on a day-to-day basis in waking reality, there were... Oh, as I was walking down the hallway... In this room there'd be dancers dancing, and in this room there'd be musicians playing, and in this room there'd be artists drawing...  And it was totally full of people who were doing all kinds of creative activities.  And as I went to the back of the building, into the area where (in daytime reality) there's a basketball court, there were groups of people working, constructing. I couldn't tell you what they were constructing, but they were using hammer and nails.  And every time, they were hammering in unison, and every strike of the hammer was in concert with music that was playing in the background.</p>

<p>It was just a lovely sight to see.</p>

<p>That's a part of the dream; that's the tone of the dream.</p>

<p>That particular dream must have carved some new pathways in my psyche, because it was at that point in time that I began dreaming and recalling my dreams prolifically.  I didn't know what was happening.  I was seeking out everything I could find.  That was not long after Patricia Garfield's and Ann Faraday's books had come out, and I found those, and found a Jungian who lived in the community and went and spoke with him, learned a few things from him, continued to dream...</p>

<p>Time went on, and in the fall of 1981, I was reading our local, weekly paper.  We had just elected a mayor in our community of Port Townsend who was a jazz pianist, and his wife was a flautist, and they were both very environmentally-conscious.  It was a very extraordinary and wonderful era in that community. He wrote a weekly column in the paper, and in August of 1981 his column said, "Is there anyone out there who'd be interested in coordinating an event to honor the 35th anniversary of the United Nations?"  For a number of reasons, which I won't go into now, I was compelled to respond to that call.</p>

<p>I called together a group of my colleagues.  We had a meeting, literally at the office where I worked in the community center. And as we were brainstorming ideas about what would we do in our small little backwater town to acknowledge the United Nations anniversary, I began getting a full-blown memory of the dream that I'd had back in '75-76, and I said that to the group.  I said, "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!"  And one man said, "Well, we've got to do it then."  Thank God!  I mean he just picked right up on it.  There wasn't a beat that was skipped before he said that.  Each of us took a piece of the work away from that meeting and proceeded to coordinate this event, which occurred on October 11, 1981. The entire event, itself, was like walking through the dream that I'd had five years ago, step by step by step.  There were no details missing.  I was existing for that time, at that intersection between the dream reality and this reality, off the ground. It started at noon and continued until two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>In some of the rooms we had arranged that artists would be there drawing portraits.  We had arranged in other rooms that there would be international foods available. In other rooms, we arranged that there would be information booths sharing news from countries in which there were concerns like apartheid, and so forth.  And, in the back room, we had a program later in the evening that went on and on and on. It just did not want to end until it finally did at two or three in the morning with Sufi dancing. It was just an absolutely wonderful and very successful event.</p>

<p>It was at that time that I knew something of extraordinary significance had just taken place and, on some level, a commitment was made in my soul to learn more, to understand more. At the same time, I'm still in this busy part of my life where there wasn't a lot of opportunity to seek out information.... and there wasn't a lot of information available.</p>

<p>Well, not long after that event happened, I had a visit from a friend -- a woman poet  -- by the name of Christina Pacosz.  She had been published a few times in the publication.  And she came to me to ask, to tell me that she had just received a letter from a man in New York City who had just started a publication called the Dream Network Bulletin.  And he had asked her to find someone in the northwest area to, what her words were, "to focalize dreamwork."  And she said, "You're it."  And she gave me the letter and encouraged me to write him.  I sat down immediately after she left and wrote Bill Stimson a letter and sent a picture of myself off to him in New York.  Fortunately, I kept a copy, I don't know why, but I made a copy of that letter before I sent it off.  But I never got a response. It just felt, after two or three, four months went by, like it had gone off into a black hole in space.</p>

<p>So once again back to the, you know, 8 to 5.  I'm back to work. This event that I just talked about, the poet coming to me, happened in the fall of '82, and I don't remember much, because I was still in that hurricane of work and family and so forth until the fall of 1987, when the harmonic convergence occurred on August 17.  I'd been carrying that date forward in my journal for about 20 years, because I thought it was going to be the magic moment, you know, the ‘blink of an eye’ that we’re all waiting for. And I was invited to a number of different events that were happening to acknowledge that occurrence, but decided to go to a place nearby Boise, Idaho, to an event that was called, "Dancing the Dream Awake." It was sponsored by Brook Medicine Eagle, and it was an all-night dance/ritual around the fire to acknowledge and celebrate the beginning of this period that we're in the midst of right now.</p>

<p>After returning from that event, I can only say that things began to change very rapidly in my life.  It wasn't very long before I decided to let go of a 20-year career as a public servant, in a wide variety of very interesting jobs.  I was very fortunate, but it was time to let go.  I wasn't certain what I was going to do, but I knew that it had to have to do something with dreams.  I needed to learn more.  And so what I did was apply to a graduate degree program that I had found that would allow me the opportunity to co-create, with my committee and faculty people, a study plan that met my needs.  And I found that program and was accepted. It was Vermont College, at Norwich University. In the early stages of that program, one of my first responsibilities was to meet with my committee and faculty people for the purpose of designing the study plan.  That process took place in California, in the spring of 1989. I went to Southern California and developed the plan.  We worked over a period of two or three weeks.  I got my study plan approved.</p>

<p>At that time, I had moved back to my home state, Utah.  When it was time to leave California, which is a two-day trip, I took a different route than I normally do, and stayed on the west side of Hopi land.  I was on a Navajo reservation, that night staying in a Navajo-owned motel. I want to back up just one minute and tell you that, while I was in the process of developing this study plan, I had relocated the Dream Network.  I had found out it was being published out of San Jose and subscribed while I was in California.  So the night that I'm staying at the motel on Navajo land, west of the Hopi reservation, I had a dream.</p>

<p>In the dream, I saw  papers hanging from the branch of a tree, blowing in the wind, and heard a voice say, "If you don't do it, somebody else will." I woke up and wondered, "What on God's green earth could that possibly mean?"  I had no idea.</p>

<p>I made my way home to Moab, Utah, which is where I've been off and on for the last 40 years.  Shortly after I got there, now with this new project, this new adventure before me, this new challenge of the graduate degree program, I was all ready to launch in it...  But not long after I got there, something occurred which is very typical in that part of the country, and it was a period of seven to ten days of absolutely relentless winds, 24 hours a day, just stirring up all of the sand in the desert, and making it virtually impossible to feel like you could complete a task in the way that you normally would, because it was very unnerving.</p>

<p>After two or three days of trying to accomplish something and being unsuccessful, I decided to stop trying and threw a few books and my journal in the day-pack, and walked up a canyon, a very beautiful canyon that I live near, and spend the day in a cave, a beautiful cave...In fact, a cave that I was guided to in a dream some years before.</p>

<p>On my way up the canyon, I stopped at my mailbox and, lo and behold, there was my first issue of the Dream Network Bulletin!  It had just arrived and so I put it in my day-pack, headed up the canyon, got about half way up the trail (it was going to be a mile, mile and a half, before I got to the cave)and I heard a voice say, “You’re going to see a snake.”... then immediately, a snake slithered across the trail. I said thank you to the voice,  hello to the snake and went on my way.</p>

<p>When I got to the cave...  (it's a beautiful cave. If you ever come to Moab, please look me up.  I'll take you there.  You won't believe it.  It's absolutely gorgeous!) ...and I  took everything out of my day-pack.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was grab the new issue of Dream Network, open it at random, and the first thing I saw was the graphic image of an eye with a snake coiled in the pupil, and it just...goosebumped me!  Ah, I'll never forget that moment.  I knew something was about to happen, and when I turned just inside the front cover, the words that my eyes fell on were,</p>

<p>"This publication is seeking a new Editor/Publisher."</p>

<p>Well, I threw everything right back in my day-pack, ran back home,  called Linda, and began communicating with her -- a communication that took place over a two or three month period of time, both by phone and letter.  As I said earlier, on summer solstice 1989, I was called by Linda and told that the Bay Area dreamworker’s group had agreed to pass the responsibility, the torch, and the beauty -- and what an adventure it is! -- on to me.</p>

<p>Not long after Linda informed me, she put out her last issue from San Jose. In it, she introduced me.  Shortly after that issue came out, I got a call from Chris Hudson, and here's where I'm going to go back to my story about Chris, because he had just moved from Brooklyn to Bellingham, Washington, very nearby where I was living, and was very excited that the publication was going to be happening so nearby him.  At that time, I was again in the northwest doing my graduate degree program. By the way, I know that part of my tale has got to be confusing because I was literally like a pinball, bouncing back and forth between the northwest and the southwest during this period of time. So don't get too confused.  I was on the Olympic Peninsula and back in Utah quite a number of times during that period. Chris called and wanted to come over and meet me.  So we agreed on a weekend, he came, and it was a very beautiful day. I had decided to suggest that we go to a beautiful park in Port Townsend to have our talk.  He was agreeable. So we went to Chetzemoka, got out of the car, began walking into the park, and Chris stopped in his tracks and said, "My God, I've got a picture of you sitting right over there in that flower garden."  And I said to him, "How could you have a picture of me sitting over there in that flower garden? We just met 15 minutes ago!"  And he proceeded to tell me that when responsibility for the publication was handed to him by Bill Stimson, that there were a good number of unopened pieces of mail.  Among them, the letter that I had sent to Bill back in 1982, which contained my picture.</p>

<p>One gets a feeling of a certain amount of destiny when these kinds of things happen.</p>

<p>Evolution of Dream Network in current years</p>

<p>The next few slides are some pictures and images of the issues that have come out over the seven years that I've been doing the publication. During this past several years, we've evolved, naturally, a few new dimensions to the publication.</p>

<p>One of the first steps that I took was to develop a Council of Advisors, and I'd like to just name those people.  Many of you know some of them, and some of these people may be completely unfamiliar, but I really want to acknowledge them because they've been an incredible help and aid to me on so many occasions:  Kelly Hunter, she's from the east coast; <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a>, most of you know; Marcia Lauck, who is here in San Jose and co-author of "At the Pool of Wonder"; Will Phillips, who you all met a short while ago; Bill Schuman, from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Barbara Shor, from New York City; and Graywolf/Fred Swinney, from southern Oregon.</p>

<p>There have been other individuals who have served during my time that include <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>, <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a>, Deborah J. Hillman, and all of whom really taught me a lot and helped a great deal during the period of time that they served in that capacity.  We also made a decision to focus each issue around a question or a theme and that seems to have worked very well.  It narrows the focus so that we aren't wandering too far over creation.</p>

<p>We've developed a statement of purpose.  I'd like to read just an excerpt of that for you:</p>

<p>"Our purpose is to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams.  We seek to disseminate information that will assist and empower us in taking responsibility for our  cultural, emotional and spiritual well-being, with the help of dreams and mythology.  Our goals are to unite and serve those who respect dreams, to empower dreamers in demystifying dreamwork, and to assist with the integration of dreamsharing in our culture, in whatever way of integrity is shown and given us.”</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, we've activated the title of the publication by encouraging committed and knowledgeable dreamworkers around the country...and in  Canada, France,  Germany, South Africa... to become listed in each issue as Networkers/Contact Persons.  Over 50 individuals are listed in each issue of the Dream Network, and are there to respond to your calls, your questions, your needs, to point you to resources, to point you to existing dream groups or help you form dream groups.  So those individuals are listed, and willing to share and make the path a lot smoother for new seekers than it was for us.</p>

<p>We've also evolved from what was a 24-page publication to 52 pages.</p>

<p>We've currently developed a presence on the World Wide Web - that's been an incredible experience to say the least.</p>

<p>We've begun just recently accepting advertising.</p>

<p>We created one subject-specific booklet that's composed of articles drawn from our very rich archives.  The one that is now published is, "The Art of Dreamsharing and Developing Dream Groups."  And we hope to publish a series of booklets bringing forth so many of these beautiful words of wisdom and experience, and articles that have only really been seen by a small handful of people over this last 14 and a half years.</p>

<p>And lastly, we're being distributed nationally on a relatively small basis, but nevertheless, being distributed nationally.</p>

<p>I'd like to close by reading and sharing some of what I've learned over this past seven years, and something else that I believe that we all have in common:</p>

<p><strong>Exploring the Mystery of Dreams</strong></p>

<p>Together we have learned that dreams constitute a field of</p>

<p>meaning and purpose as vast and complex as our knowledge</p>

<p>of the known universe. </p>

<p>We know that, although we're just becoming reacquainted,</p>

<p>other cultures and civilizations in the world have valued,</p>

<p>cherished, utilized, and manifested dreams and visions for centuries. </p>

<p>Many have been persecuted over the past 20 centuries</p>

<p>for doing the work we share today. </p>

<p>Like mercury, the field of dreams is elusive,</p>

<p>a mystery, expansive, ever evading definition,</p>

<p>description, categorization,</p>

<p>and forever earning our respect.</p>

<p>I believe we all agree that dreams are meaningful and purposeful.</p>

<p>We know that we all dream every night,</p>

<p>in fact many dreams each night.</p>

<p>Not all of our dreams are recalled,</p>

<p>and not all that are recalled can be readily</p>

<p>comprehended or shared with another.</p>

<p>We know dreams are essential and vital tools in therapy,</p>

<p>still they can be engaged in silence,</p>

<p>in our journals, with our spouse, our children, our neighbors,</p>

<p>in dream groups, because we know we all dream every night.</p>

<p>We have learned that dreams can be incubated to solve problems,</p>

<p>answer questions, provide guidance.</p>

<p>Dreams often give timely warnings for ourselves or for another.</p>

<p>Dreams provide insight, bring darkness into light.</p>

<p>Dreams awaken us, frighten us, shake us up,</p>

<p>puzzle and perplex us, allow us to waken within them. </p>

<p>And, if we're inclined, to control them.</p>

<p>We can meet together in the dreamtime reality,</p>

<p>a time and space beyond time-space.</p>

<p>In dreams, we can fly or die, and be reborn.</p>

<p>Dreams show us the future, shed light on the past,</p>

<p>even past lives.</p>

<p>In dreams, we're often prepared for the death of a loved-one,</p>

<p>and there is provision of ground for contact with them</p>

<p>from the other side.</p>

<p>Dreams are known to have been the catalyst for authoring books,</p>

<p>composing music,</p>

<p>creating new inventions,</p>

<p>inspiring poetry,</p>

<p>creating art and sculpture.</p>

<p>Dreams prophesize.</p>

<p>Dreams are spirits' way of speaking to us.</p>

<p>Dreams heal.</p>

<p>In one word, dreams Reveal.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><!--nopreview--><h2>The birth of my new dream-inspired song</h2><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>This song and the fact that I chose to record it are inspired by a number of dreams. I have experienced many dreams spread over a couple decades that encourage me to record and share more music. Many such dreams involve various famous musical artists. These come at least monthly, sometimes weekly, and occasionally more often. I am lucky to be amongst the tiny percentage of people whose dreams include music and sound. </p>

<p>My newly released song <em>“Lucid (Never Felt As Good)”</em> was originally inspired by a music-only dream where I “received” the lyrics and melody from the song’s opening line and chorus. Just before I awaken, I clearly hear a disembodied voice singing, <em>“Wherever I’ve been in my life, I’ve never felt as good as when I’m with you.”</em> This type of dream melody with lyrics is not unusual for me, but I liked the tune and decided to experiment with it on guitar. Within a few weeks, I composed more lyrics and created a chord pattern and song structure around the dream melody. That was the easy part. </p>

<p>Then came another dream, again music only: <em>I hear the last few notes of the song’s guitar solo bridge as a distorted electric guitar.</em> Again no visuals, but what seems to me a clear suggestion from the muse to switch the feel from acoustic/folk to more rock and roll, especially for the solo. The sound of the electric guitar solo in the recording is much like I heard it in the dream. I recorded the song with friends but the quality was low. Dreams urged me to again record more music and I decided to revisit this song since I felt it was kind of catchy. The recording-arranging process spread over 10 months. In that time, I had multiple dreams encouraging me to continue recording and arranging it. Towards the end of arranging, I had a breakthrough evening where I found the sound I was looking for. I went to sleep very late, but happy. In the morning, I had what felt like a celebration dream: </p>

<p>*A spiritual teacher of mine is strolling along the red carpet. Waking, the dream feels related to the song. *</p>

<p>A week or so later, when I was having trouble blending the mix, another dream came: </p>

<p><em>I’m with my sister at the breakfast table, listening to the current mix with her. It seems that the mixing process is dragging on far too long on the last few notes. I am also shocked to hear that the drums and guitar arrangement has been changed and now sounds quite heavy metal, though it sounds good in an unusual way. At that point, I decide not to change the arrangement any further.</em></p>

<p>Within a couple weeks of completing the recording, Grace has blessed this song with air play on about 150 radio stations so far and I am very grateful. </p>

<p>Among other music I’ve composed, dreams also inspired the recording of my fun environmental song Polymers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFy6npBQ8mU</a></p>

<p>Life has now blessed me with well over a thousand lucid dreams, so to share some of the dream and lucidity skills and insights that have come my way, I lead lively online interactive teleclasses about how to harvest dreams for creativity (music, art, inventions, film etc.), healing, life path guidance, spiritual growth, adventure, etc. ℘ </p>

<p>The phenomenon of flying in one's sleep is truly a miracle. If, as they say, ontogeny recapitulates philogeny, then consider the premise that we are all, at some time in our primal development. equipped with tail, gills and wings and all other aspects of an the creatures that live in air and water, especially fish and birds. The fact that dreamers can fly and breathe underwater as well as free fly in their sleep without any previous instruction or practice may be related to this innate, though undeveloped, potential.</p>

<p>For some years I have been collecting flying dreams. Everywhere I go I ask people how they fly. I want to include in this book a few of the interesting reports I've received, both to encourage dream flyers to share their adventures and to inspire others, especially those timid dreamers who have never experienced free flying, to try to relax and develop your will to fly.</p>

<p>The styles of flying are far more numerous than I ever imagined. They include flapping, soaring, sitting, lying, swimming, flopping, breast and butterfly stroking, dolphin kicking, whale tail snapping, and the yoga sit style of flying. </p>

<p>Then we have ASSIST FLYING: people empowered to fly holding a stick, a magic wand, or by riding a refrigerator, bed soaring, carpet flying, floor grabbing, back packing, and, most original, something called bloodpressure cuff pump flying. There is low and high altitude flying. Some can fly only a few inches off the ground. Some can do barn storming. A young woman says she flies, but never above the telephone wires. My son claims he's expert at indoor ceiling hovering. Some people jump to take off and fly at head height. Some fly at building height. Some are totally weightless for outer space flying. </p>

<p>We have human jet travelers and cosmic trans-gravity floaters. Some run on trans-spirit supersonic propulsion. Many hover out of their bodies. </p>

<p>Then there are just plain old fashioned BIRD flappers. Some have to make a great effort to stay up, while others rise off the ground at will. We even have those who fly in the body of another. </p>

<p>There are stories about effortless flight and stories of flight frustration. Some people go somewhere and others go nowhere. You can fly for joy or what one man calls efficiency flying; the only way to get there faster. Some dreamers are propelled by fear, called the fight or flight style. Some Guru followers know about spiritual transcendance, and a gal from California describes orgasmic cartwheeling. </p>

<p>We have stories of people who fly on air channels, people who FLY TO SEE and people who FLY TO FEEL. METHOD FLYING uses guide ropes or long stride takeoffs. Ordinary arm flapping is common, but fish tail flopping is rare. Some dreamers have to run in air or they can't stay up. One physicist uses the balling up method where he shoots through the atmosphere. A mathematician on my street does what he calls the tadpole wiggle. He says he can also sit on the back of a couch and slip out through the top of his head. Some of the experienced meditators say they do levitation rising. </p>

<p>Then there is intention flying versus guided imagining. I've got stories about losing power in midflight, as well as flying faster than light. One woman from the midwest says she flew to her father racing death, and was able to say good by before he died. Some dreamers tell about floating through walls, through floors and windows. They can float down stairs, or descend head first diving, spinning, dancing, with arms backwards and arms forward. Some have no arms at all. </p>

<p>Upside-down flying is more difficult, says a girl from New Hampshire, because you can't see where you are going at all. I'm waiting for more information about ecstatic flying orgasms. The girl who can bring them on at will says she has invented a dream pill and has a teachable Olympic routine of sexual acrobatics and tandem flying. </p>

<p>While presenting some dream programs for the "outer-most" listener supported radio station in Provincetown Mass., I received more contributions to my collection of flying dreams. I am fascinated by the variety of methods, positions, problems and adventures of those lucky dreamers who have the flying skill on command.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-0.jpg" alt="Hoffman at his computer" /></p>

<p>Dreams have long been a source of inspiration for musical composers of all genres. For example, Richard Wagner – who once wrote that “all poetry is only true dream interpretation” – recounted in his autobiography that he was unable to find a way to begin his gigantic Ring of the Niebelungen cycle when he had a dream in which he felt that he was drowning in overwhelming waves, while the figurations of an E flat major chord sounded in his mind. When he awoke, he realized that his dream had provided him with the opening of Das Rheingold, which is set at the bottom of the Rhine River. </p>

<p>When I proposed doing a symposium on music and dreaming to some colleagues at the 2010 IASD conference, what I had in mind to present was exploring how music finds its way into my dreams and how my unconscious mind is able to recognize musical themes and compositions. However, recent events in my dream life have transformed this study into an exploration of how music found its way out of my dreams and into a partially finished composition. </p>

<p>I have journaled my dreams for the past 19 years, using a database program that allows me to retrieve motifs with ease over the entire period. Out of a total of 9,696 recorded dreams, 332 contain the words “music” or “musical” – an average of 3.4% of the total. Over time, the number of musical dreams averaged 17.3 per year, and tended to increase to a peak in year 11 (2002-3), then to decrease to around the mean, and lastly to increase again sharply, starting in year 18 and continuing to the present (2009-11). (See Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-2.jpg" alt="Graph" /></p>

<p>In addition to these two keywords, there have been numerous other occurrences of musical genres in my dreams. Music has always been a part of my life; I trained as a clarinetist from an early age and played in bands and orchestras through my second year in college. Over the past 9 years, as the result of a dream I reported in DNJV24#1, I have returned to instrumental practice on the crumhorn, a Renaissance double reed instrument ancestral to the oboe and the English horn. Mostly my interest is in classical music, but as Table 2 shows, both jazz and rock music appear in my dreams and are part of my waking appreciation, also. Missing from this list—and of less interest to me in waking life—are popular music, folk music, country, hip-hop, rap, and such genres. They do show up in my dreams, but more rarely. So, this listing somewhat parallels my musical tastes. However, as I do not consider myself to be a particularly good singer, it is a bit surprising that song shows up at the top of the list.</p>

<h3>Table 2: Genres (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Song – 100 <br>Performance – 96 <br>Tune – 86 <br>Symphony – 46 <br>Opera – 25 <br>Voice – 23 <br>Jazz – 20 <br>Concerto – 17 <br>Rock – 16 <br>Classical – 10 <br>Prelude – 10 <br>Overture – 7 <br>Duet – 7 <br>March – 7 <br>Hymn – 6 <br>Sonata – 6 <br>Composition – 6 <br>Trio – 5</p>

<p>Also, there have been a number of more technical musical terms appearing with some frequency in my dreams. These are shown in Table 3, and obviously reflect upon my familiarity with the language of music and its incorporation into my dream life.</p>

<h3>Table 3: Technical Terms (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Theme – 63<br>Note – 62<br>Movement – 39<br>Bass – 36<br>Key – 24<br>Tenor – 22<br>Rhythm – 21<br>Staff – 19<br>Harmony – 16<br>Measure – 13<br>Alto – 13<br>Melody – 13<br>Beat – 12<br>Tone – 12<br>Pitch – 11<br>Lyrics – 10<br>Variation – 9<br>Soprano – 9<br>Scale – 8<br>Flat – 7<br>Octave – 5<br>Sharp – 4 </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-1.jpg" alt="Music" /></p>

<p>In addition, actions of a musical nature appear in my dreams, especially playing and singing. These are shown in Table 4. (This listing does not include any non-musical instances of these verbs, such as playing games, or conducting tours.) Though I am not a profi cient vocalist, once again, singing is high on the list. Composing is rather far down on the list; while I composed a little music during high school, it is not something that I have felt motivated to do… until recently.</p>

<h3>Table 4: Key Actions (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Play – 298<br>Sing – 143<br>Perform – 49<br>Chant – 33<br>Conduct – 14<br>Practice –10<br>Hum - 10<br>Compose – 6 </p>

<p>A wide variety of musical instruments have appeared in my dreams, as shown in Table 5. Not surprisingly, the crumhorn and the clarinet—the two instruments I actually play—have a high frequency; as a crumhornist, I play with a recorder group, which might account for the frequency of recorders on the list. But I do not play piano, or any stringed or brass instruments. So their frequent appearance in my dreams would seem to derive from listening rather than playing music.</p>

<h3>Table 5: Instruments (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Instrument – 87<br>Piano – 52<br>Crumhorn – 37<br>Recorder – 31<br>Clarinet – 29<br>Drum – 23<br>Violin – 19<br>Flute – 17<br>Trumpet – 13<br>Guitar – 12<br>Reed – 11<br>Saxophone – 10<br>Cello – 9<br>Organ – 7<br>Viola – 6<br>Bassoon – 6<br>Oboe – 6<br>Harpsichord – 6<br>Mouthpiece – 6<br>Trombone – 5<br>Pipe – 4<br>Sitar – 3<br>Tympani – 3<br>Bow – 3 </p>

<p>The same pattern is demonstrated by the types of performers who appear in my dreams. As Table 6 shows, although wind players are near the top, singers exceed them in frequency; and other types of performers are not far behind. Much of the music I listen to is orchestral but increasingly, chamber music as well. I haven’t listened to much choral music, so it’s surprising that choristers appear so often. This may prefigure the developments I will discuss later in the article.</p>

<h3>Table 6: Performers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Singers – 40<br>Conductors – 26<br>Wind Players – 26<br>Orchestra – 24<br>String Players – 19<br>Table 6<br>Keyboardists – 10<br>Music Teachers – 9<br>Rock Groups – 9<br>Brass Players – 8<br>Bands – 7<br>Jazz Musicians – 6<br>Percussionists – 6 </p>

<p>A wide diversity of composers is represented in my dreams: 54 identifiable composers in all. Table 7 indicates all those appearing at least twice. Mahler and Wagner, who definitely rank among my favorites, are at the top of the list. However, the rest of the distribution is not entirely in accord with my waking life tastes. Some of my favorite composers — for example, Rachmaninoff and Vaughan-Williams — are very far down on the list; others, like Bruckner and Puccini, have only appeared once. With the exception of Michael Praetorius, none of the Renaissance and early Baroque composers whose music I now frequently play appear on this list. It might be suggested that the frequency of composers in my dreams is correlated with the degree to which their music impacts me emotionally … but the four Late Romantic composers I mentioned above, appeared only once or twice, and yet they wrote highly emotionally charged music.</p>

<h3>Table 7: Composers (in descending order of frequency)</h3>

<p><br>Gustav Mahler – 35<br>Richard Wagner – 25<br>Johannes Brahms – 16<br>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – 16<br>The Beatles – 16<br>Ludwig van Beethoven – 16<br>Johann Sebastian Bach – 12<br>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky – 9<br>Felix Mendelssohn – 5<br>Franz Schubert – 5<br>Antonin Dvorak – 4<br>Frederic Chopin – 4<br>Richard Strauss – 4<br>Giuseppi Verdi – 4<br>Jan Sibelius – 3<br>Franz Josef Haydn – 3<br>Michael Praetorius – 3<br>Robert Schumann - 3<br>Leonard Bernstein-3<br>Edvard Grieg – 2<br>Bob Dylan – 2<br>Percy Grainger - 2<br>Georg Frederick Handel – 2<br>Johann Pachelbel – 2<br>Sergei Rachmaninoff – 2<br>Camille Saint-Saens – 2<br>Dmitri Shostakovich - 2<br>Ralph Vaughan-Williams – 2<br>Carl Maria von Weber – 2<br>plus 29 others – 1 each </p>

<p>As I reported in DNJ V29#3, during the summer of 2010 I read Jung’s Red Book and it had a profound effect upon my consciousness. Themes from the book frequently appeared in my dreams and waking synchronous experience, and in dreams, often prior to my reading them. The “biggest” dream in this series concerned my observation of a group of choristers performing an a capella cantata based upon texts from the Red Book. Upon awakening, I realized that the texts derived from the “Incantations” section of the book, in which Jung presents a series of prayers within his dreaming that was directed to the Babylonian hero Gilgamesh, whom he had previously (in the dream) mortally wounded then saved, by collapsing him to miniscule size and placing him within an egg, which he brought to a village for incubation.</p>

<p>Subsequent dreaming has made it clear to me that I have been asked to compose this cantata out of themes my dreaming presents to me. Even though I had no formal education in musical composition, I agreed to undertake this project. The first stage was to translate the words of the Incantations from German into Akkadian, the actual language of the Gilgamesh epic. My training in ancient Near Eastern languages has made it possible for me to accomplish this. Next, I am applying to the Incantations section text the specific musical themes derived from my dreams.</p>

<p>My dreams indicated that the cantata would be sung a capella by four voices, and that it would be in 6 sections. In order to manifest this, I have audited two Music Theory courses this year, which enabled me to set the melodies my dreams gave me within a tonal harmonic structure. Far from easy!</p>

<p>The first section I was moved to set to music is associated with a powerful Red Book image (Jung 2009:55): the sun barque of the Egyptian god Ra sailing over the surface of the waters, beneath which lurks a monstrous fi sh, identified by Jung as the “Spirit of the Depths.” The text consists of four lines and the melody for it was given to me in a dream. Translated into English, these are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One word, which has never yet been spoken; </p>
  
  <p>One light, which has not yet shone; </p>
  
  <p>One confusion, without equal; </p>
  
  <p>And one road, without end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfgil1-3.jpg" alt="Music spiral" /></p>

<p>Underlying the text, the Akkadian words for “Spirit of the Depths” are intoned as an undulating pedal, representing the waves. In addition, singers from time to time hold long notes on “a,” which is the Sumerian word for water. </p>

<p>The piece is in four sections, each of which corresponds to one of the four lines of the text. The first section picks up the theme of “one word” from the dream, as each line is sung solo above the bass pedal, first by the tenor, then by the alto, then by the soprano, then again by the tenor. </p>

<p>In the second section, the melody is taken up by the sopranos, harmonized by the altos, while the tenors sing the pedal and the basses harmonize beneath them. This corresponds to the “one light” phrase. </p>

<p>In the third, “confusion” section, the sopranos sing arpeggios while the altos hold the pedal and the tenors sing the melody, harmonized by the basses. </p>

<p>The fourth, “road” section, the sopranos sing descending road-like quarter notes while the altos harmonize, the tenors hold the pedal and the basses have the melody. There is a brief coda in which the pedal finally reaches the water’s surface with the soprano line and then works its way down through the voices. </p>

<p>This piece was premiered at the 2011 IASD conference to a receptive audience. A second section of the cantata was performed in August of 2011 at the same music camp that provided the inspiration for the original dream that “commissioned” the cantata. </p>

<p>Since I undertook the writing of the cantata, dreams about it have come in profusion. I have had 47 dreams in which the cantata was featured, 35 providing musical themes. In 11 of these, I have actually visualized the notes on the staff; more often, I just hear the themes. Most of these dreams are just brief snippets… or the theme occurs only at the end of a longer dream. Some dreams have provided me with insights into the structure of the cantata or helped me to revise what I have written. I know that there are themes that I have not been able to recall in the morning, but one dream early in the process informed me that these are being stored in my unconscious for when I will need them later on. </p>

<p>The creative process sometimes takes unexpected twists and turns; for example, the section performed last summer combines two dream themes in a canonical structure. I had no idea that the second theme would fi t the fi rst as well as it does. An early dream indicated that I would need to incorporate a chorale from Bach’s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> into one section of the cantata. Recent dreams have shown me that this will actually be in a rondo form, with several repeats of the chorale interspersed with other dream themes. A section I am working on now contrasts a vigorous hora rhythm from one dream against a more melodic pastoral theme from another. As Jung observed of the paintings which accompany his dreams in the <em>Red Book</em>, sometimes they didn’t come out the way he expected! </p>

<p>In many instances, I have no idea with what portion of the cantata the themes will go. But in other cases, I get the words with the music. My knowledge of music enables me to see that some of the themes bear a relationship to existing music. But other themes are unfamiliar and hopefully my dreams will give me more! ℘</p>

<p>Letting go of control in lucid dreams has helped me to begin a beautiful friendship, guide a lover relationship through a healthy transformation and facilitate healing between my conscious and unconscious self. </p>

<p>In the world of lucid dreaming, where one gains the power to have everything and do anything, letting go of control seems to be a contradiction. It can take years to master this power, so why would anyone want to give it up? I remember when I first started to lucid dream around ten years ago, I flew around wildly, indulging in all sorts of sensual pleasures, mostly having sex. I had absolutely no respect for my dream characters and no communication beyond, "Too bad, bud, after all, it's MY dream!" In fact, a fellow student in a lucid dreaming study group I was participating in at the time kidded me that my mug shot was up on a bulletin board in the Dream Post Office! Since sowing my W.I.L.D. oats (Willful Instruction of Lucid Dreaming), I have learned better communication with my dream characters and with my unconscious self. Being conscious 24 hours a day not only can be very draining and counterproductive but misleading since your unconscious really has the ultimate control, anyway. Then, on February 3, 1987, early in the morning, I had the following lucid dream which I consider to be a milestone in my Dream Journey:</p>

<h3>The Afterglow of Letting Go</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am having an ordinary dream when suddenly I realize that my room is peculiarly different and that I must be dreaming. This jolt of lucidity excites me so much that my dream thoughts and desires became scattered and fragmented. I do not know what to do with my lucidity and become frustrated and anxious. Then I recall something I read in Lucid Dreaming, something I had been thinking about right before going to sleep: that giving up control is a healthy reaction in a lucid dream. So, I think, "I'll just go where the dream takes me and deal with adventures as they happen." Suddenly I begin floating upwards, then rushing backwards at a tremendous speed. The sensation is utterly magnificent! I pass through treetops in the early Spring, able to see and feel each lovely, green leaf in exquisite detail. The clarity is intensely beyond anything I have ever experienced in waking life. I feel delighted and at peace.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I awoke, the joyous glow from the dream was still with me. I rolled out of bed and into the cafe across the street. There I spied a sad, young man to whom I felt powerfully drawn. This young man and I have since developed a beautiful friendship, a special connection which I attribute to the afterglow of letting go in a lucid dream. </p>

<p>So, the very act of letting go, regardless of whether the context is related to the waking life situation that one wants to change, creates an aura of positive energy that enables one to deal more easily, almost magically, with the happenstances of life. </p>

<p>However, one of the most powerful lucid dreams I ever had was an example of rehearsing in the dream what I wished to accomplish in waking life, in this case, letting go of a failed romantic relationship. I had been involved with D. for 9 months. She ended the relationship, but for me, it was not over. I continued to call her and she continued to reject me. I just couldn't accept the fact that we'd never see one another again because something deep inside of me just knew that we were fated to be friends. Yet, whenever I called her and chatted about my life, she would offer no information about herself, answering questions with the bare minimum. All my friends advised me to forget about her, but I just couldn't give up. Then one night, on impulse, I called her at 11pm and asked her to accompany me on a walk to North Beach. To my surprise, she accepted. San Francisco was at its romantic best: full moon, balmy, sweet air, thick, rich fog rolling in from another plane. As usual, my neediness and desire for D. were blaring more loudly than the foghorns. But, for a few minutes, D. was not her usual aloof self. She talked about a case of child abuse that deeply disturbed her. For an instant, I saw her sobbing, but realized that this was a psychic seeing, not a physical reality. I put my arm around her and experienced another psychic flash of her crying in my arms. Yet she was not showing me any kind of affection at all. I risked giving her a hug and for one eternal moment, I knew we were connected and that she knew, too, in spite of all the external evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, I knew that I would have an incredible lucid dream that night. There was no need to practice the M.I.L.D. technique nor do reality checks. I didn't have the dream. The dream had me! </p>

<h3>Even in a Dream One Must Let Go</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>D. is lingering around my apartment and made it apparent that she intends to spend the night. My sisters are also there. D. begins touching and kissing me; I am very excited and start making sounds of pleasure. She "shushes" me so I wouldn't wake up my sisters. Then, I realize I am dreaming and my sisters fade from the scene. I hold D. in my arms, replacing the sexual energy with a deep feeling of intimacy, an incredibly comforting closeness. I say, "How I've fantasized doing this with you. Just holding you." Then, I want to fly and explain to D. about lucid dreaming. She is skeptical at first and for a moment even I wonder if I am really dreaming; part of me resists the heartbreaking reality that our renewed relationship is "just a dream". I bust out the window glass, grab D's hand and jump out, almost expecting to fall and die but then a jolt of awareness reinforces my lucidity and flying is glorious.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>For the next portion of the dream, we keep landing and taking off slowly and low to the ground. D. wants to learn to fly on her own power and is still too timid to take great leaps. I treat her as an independent entity and let her go at her own pace. I do, however, share my expertise, showing her that we do not have to fly around trees but can go right through them and experience each and every leaf in exquisite, vibrating detail. We make love in the sky as we soar and I experience my first lucid dream orgasm. Then, I begin to explain to D. that this is <strong>my</strong> dream and suddenly, upon seeing her puzzled expression, I get this clear and real feeling that she is <strong>not</strong> simply a character in my dream but actually the dream body of the flesh and blood D. We go on to have many more adventures which have faded from my memory. But then my elation turns into sadness when I realize that I will wake up soon. I take hold of D.'s hand, determined to enjoy the moments while they last without trying to control them. I try to explain, the techniques of "spinning" to her in case she really is the dream body of D. so that she can go on dreaming when I wake up if she so desires. Then D. begins to fade, to metamorphosize. Eventually, she becomes another character altogether and chastises me for still seeing her as D. I am heartbroken and start to lose lucidity. I consider "spinning" and trying to get D. to reappear. Instead I wake up weeping, tears spill out of my waking eyes and I am chanting: "Even in a dream, one must let go; even in a dream, one must let go."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After one call, I stopped calling her... not out of any disciplined struggle but just naturally. A few months later, she called me and wanted to get together. I told her my dream and for the first time since we had broken up, she opened up-shared the past two years of her life with me, revealed that she had another lover. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, once again attributed to the process of letting go in a lucid dream. </p>

<p>In healing the relationship between my conscious and unconscious self, a very special kind of friendship, I've not only had to learn to let go IN lucid dreams but to let go OF lucid dreams entirely! In October of 1991, after recognizing my first dream-disguised memory, I began using dreams to facilitate my healing from childhood sexual abuse. At first, my conscious self, desperate to remember everything and remember it RIGHT NOW, threw me like a battering ram against the castle walls of my unconscious. Every night I attempted to lucid dream and to command my unconscious to conjure up the details of my abuse. I often succeeded, except the lucidity was mostly low-grade: fading in and out, riddled with disturbing false awakenings and the strange, frustrating phenomenon of merely <em>dreaming</em> I was having a lucid dream without actually achieving lucidity. The following dream, in which I managed to attain a fairly high level of lucidity, clearly demonstrated the need to relinquish control:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I rush around, everything is chaotic. I find myself in a walled garden. with graves that I have visited before in another lucid dream. I feel peace for a moment, then am obsessed and feverish about remembering who my victimizer was when I was a child. I kneel down in the dirt-I can vividly feel and smell the dirt-and go through the motions of oral copulation, trying to conjure up a penis and yelling over and over again, "Who was it? Who am I having sex with?" I am trying too hard. I cannot make anyone appear. There is only the feel of dirt in between my fingernails and the smell of earth in my nostrils. I wake up exhausted and terrified.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I am letting go of this desperate need to lucid dream about my abuse and am trusting my unconscious self to reveal its secrets in its own time and own way, whether that be through lucid dreams, non-lucid dreams, memory flashes, etc. I still program the intent to remember and to heal into my pre-sleep consciousness but not as frequently and forcefully as before. On March 16, I was rewarded with a long and grand lucid dream, most of which I will summarize here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...go back to sleep. No intent but stay lucid for a long time. I fly and breathe in the most wondrous Springtime air and sing at the top of my lungs and send energy through my bad knee as I run around a track, my dream body ecstatic. Then I try to conjure up a man to have sex with. I am only able to create a child, then see, that the child is me. I look exactly like I do in one of my baby photos when I am one year old. At first I am terrified, then I remember an intent I had planted in my mind while awake. I hold "myself" in my arms and say, "I know what happened to you. You're safe now. I'll protect you." I rock myself and feel at peace...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I still have a long way to go in my healing and in learning about creating and maintaining intimate relationships, I feel blessed by the help I am receiving through my dreams.∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>People are becoming increasingly health conscious. Dreams, however, are often overlooked as a potential aid to good health. The following account of a persistent health problem shows how dreams can be called upon to provide continuing health care information.</p>

<p>The situation has a history that begins over twenty years ago when I had my first hangnail infection. A hangnail may sound like a minor problem, but the infection was resistant to medical treatment and led to hospitalization. A surgeon removed the infected tissue including the bone tuft. This procedure was effective, but left me with a smaller fingertip. Years later, a similar infection in another finger was treated on an outpatient basis. The result of this treatment was a healed finger that included a hard, sensitive scar tissuelike projection near the nail. I learned that serious risks accompany traditional medical care of such infections. </p>

<p>On December 1, 1984, I recognized the beginning of another hangnail, this time in the original, slightly shrunken, left index finger. It was during a period of considerable stress. I had left full time employment to complete my doctoral program in psychology. My resistance to infection was down. I was also dealing with the residual effects of flu along with persistent middle ear fluid buildup problems. In the intervening years, however, I had adopted a more wholistic life view and this time decided to take more direct treatment responsibility. I began with a small castor oil-soaked bandage. Castor oil is reported to facilitate the healing process.</p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-1.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The next morning I had the first in a series of dreams related to the finger. The dream confirmed the fact that I had a "hangnail" and would riot be seen as a "good patient" by conventional medical doctors. Several days later, the swelling had Increased and the finger was very sensitive to touch. I wrote in my dream journal, "Help, I'm scared." I feared surgery, a medically accepted treatment of choice. I could imagine what the surgeon would cut now that the bone tuft was gone. I did not want to chance losing more of the finger. Neither did I want the expense, risk, or time away from my academic work that traditional medical care would require. I now actively sought help from my dreams. </p>

<p>I interpreted an unclear dream as an indication I should see a doctor. So, on the next day, December 10th, I saw a doctor. He recommended that I discontinue my castor oil treatment, but continue with epsom salt soaks accompanied by an antibiotic ointment. I followed his advice and added visual imagery exercises to encourage the infection coming to a head, so the doctor could cut the upper skin and release the resulting pus. </p>

<p>A frightening dream came the day after I saw the doctor. In the dream, I took a piece of wood my grandfather handed me and noticed that it had termites in one section. I banged the wood on the ground and watched the termites come out, go Into a pile and then die from exposure. I then smashed the Queen and one other termite. To me, the termites in the wood represented infection in the bone. I knew that bone infections are notoriously resistant to treatment. Fear prevented me from seeing positive aspects of the dream. </p>

<p>I became obsessed with the infection. I got my name added to a prayer group listing. I began calling friends asking for their prayers. One friend, who is especially psychic, called back moments after my call. He had been meditating when I called, returned to the meditative state and asked for advice on my behalf. The recommendation which came to him was accompanied by a brilliant white light. I should use a castor oil pack. I was familiar with castor oil packs and had been using one before the doctor recommended I stop. </p>

<p>I got castor oil soaked wool felt and made a total finger pack which I used with heat for an hour and a half two times a day. My psychic friend called a couple of times during the next two days and mentioned he had also gotten the recommendation that 1 use epsom salt soaks followed by a cleansing with lemon oil; that I would see improvement in from three to six days. I followed this advice, but wasn't sure what form the "improvement" would take. The swelling began to increase and was now accompanied by redness and subsurface yellow pus which began to spread around the base of the nail. Seven worrisome days after my friend's initial recommendation I actively sought dream guidance that I could understand. I awoke with a vague impression of perforation of the skin -the idea that if I found a preparation that would help to draw out the infection at this point, that would be helpful. </p>

<p>The following day, December 18th, I saw the doctor for the second time. He carefully cut the surface layer of skin, drained off the pus and applied antbiotic ointment. The finger improved dramatically. I was more relieved than I had been in days. I was able to reflect on my consuming fears of pain, surgery, and possible failure of my wholistic measures. I got insight regarding how I developed the very fearful side of myself. I realized the powerful impact of fear and toned for situations where I had caused fear in others. I could now relax. </p>

<p>The respite was short lived. Ten days after the doctor's treatment, I dreamed: I saw an index finger with the little flap of skin turned back to expose pus. </p>

<p>I checked my finger carefully and noticed pus around the base of the nail. The infection had come back to life. I resumed ointment and castor oil treatment. I anxiously sought dream information. The resulting dreams indicated a connection between the infection and my overly strong preoccupation with it. It was difficult to reduce my preoccupation since I was constantly reminded of the problem by the ever present protective bandage and the fact that I typed several hours each day. Nevertheless, my finger did improve noticeably. Two months after the onset, it looked healed but was still extremely sensitive and barely sable. I had the doctor check it. He assured me that the finger was fine and that I had healed quickly. I knew the finger was not fine. </p>

<p>The sensitivity continued. Once again, I resumed the castor oil treatments and requested dream guidance. My answering dream included a scene where I got castor oil all over my trousers and could not find anything to wipe it off with - hardly a positive recommendation for continued castor oil use. A few days later a dream made reference to a crayfish biting one of the fingers of my right hand. The possibility of the dream being related to the problems with my left index finger were unclear. Another dream reference occurred a few days later when I dreamed of wrestling with someone "in play, but must be careful of my finger." This last dream was dramatic and revitalized fears for my finger. </p>

<p><img src="../images/5.6-strock-2.jpg" alt="hand" /></p>

<p>The question was, if castor oil were not indicated, then what could I do to provide effective treatment? In desperation I began an intense search for treatment clues that included every medical reference I owned, including: <em>Conn's Therapy</em>, the <em>Merck Manual</em>, and wholistic health sources. As a result of my haH day search, I decided to use lodex, a topical preparation I had never used before. I called a store and reserved a jar, planning to pick it up the next day. That night, my dreams came alive. The following dream on February 19, 1985 was a breakthrough: </p>

<p><em>I'm looking into a school yard fenced with chain link fence. In a leanto-like shelter are two college friends sitting in a special mud. It is a life experiment! I recalled having difficulty "getting" the name of the mud. Finally I got it - ICHTHYOL.</em></p>

<p>By the time I was fully awake, I recognized lchthyol as a medication I had react about the day before. I did not associate it with my finger, but thought that the dream was somehow related to my ear problems for which I was also soliciting help from my dreams. I later reread the description, noticed a functional similarity to lodex, and then made the connection. As indicated in the dream, it was difficult "to get." lchthyol is the trade name of a discontinued product - a drawing salve. I did locate the medication under its generic name, ichthammol, and began using it immediately. Surprise! It smelled and looked like mud. I was fascinated and read more about it. The descriptions warned about becoming reliant on such preparations. I slowed down my use of the product. A dream responded by pointing out the spiritual nature of dream guidance and its relevence to my current problem. I resumed full use of the ichthammol. </p>

<p>Three months after the first indication of a problem, I was shocked by the following dream's power and lightning fast action. </p>

<p><em>I'm the lead character on stage in a play. The fellow who designed the play pushed a sword through my lapel and on through my finger. Just as quickly, he withdrew it. I looked down and was surprised to see that it didn't hurt. He had done it expertly. later, I looked at the wound. Each opening had healed, although of course it was still healing inside. I thought about putting salt water on it, but didn't think it needed it.</em></p>

<p>My immediate reaction was: IT WAS A CLEAN CUT. THE FINGER WAS HEALED. </p>

<p>In my joy of realizing the infection was gone, I neglected the statements about continued healing and salt water. Continued finger stiffness renewed my concerns. On March 14, 1985, came the last dream of the series; simply an impression that all the finger needed was exercise. Careful exercise soon brought my finger back to full use.</p>

<p>Overlooked dream clues and encouragement became apparent in a later review of the log. The critical use of a drawing salve in the Jast phases of treatment was indicated by a couple of early dreams. The reference to my grandfather was undoubtedly related to his frequent use of a "drawing salve" as treatment for job-related metal splinters. Another dream referred to a "preparation that would help draw out the infection" long before the mud experiment dream. Other uninterpretted symbols undoubtedly hold a wealth of untapped information. Dreams clearly played a helpful, dynamic andmultifaceted role in the entire healing process.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong>THE OLD MAN</strong> was still working. He had enough money and didn’t need to work, but working was a part of him. He dimly realized that his sparkle of existence fueled by over half a century of work was dying. He needed to know if his illusory passion for a different kind of work was real or only an empty excuse to stop working altogether. </p>

<p>His thoughts floated on the mist of awareness into a dream where…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A slender, almost shapeless woman covered in silence appears before him. Her features dissolve, leaving only the sheen and smooth perfection of her short, silvery-white hair. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream woman was important. She was to be his comfort, his source of reassurance that he needed to give energy to a new dream. She would be able to release him from his worries, the worries of many elders: that their potential for making a mark in the world will be denied them in this new world of speeding change that defies comprehension. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time is visibly absent. Neither the old man nor the woman disturbs the stillness. They just stand opposite one another, seeing each other, but with no exchange of any kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>THE TIRED, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN</strong> had just changed careers. She had emerged from the stifling cocoon of a corporate management position to pursue a new life. With adrenalin-charged power, she worked her way through a grueling graduate education program right along side quick learning students in there twenties. She emerged victorious with a master’s degree, enormous debts, and only a part time job. As she drifts into dreams, she looks forward to seeing her grandfather again. In the comfort and silence of their meetings, their love for each other eclipses the need for any talk.</p>

<p><strong>THE YOUNG MAN IN HIS THIRTIES</strong> feels invincible. His power and vision are as yet unchallenged by the need to overcome the inevitabilities of future discouragement and pain. Dreams provide him with strong counselors and teachers whose advice and answers he knows will ensure success in his all-encompassing endeavors. </p>

<p><strong>THE LITTLE GIRL</strong> is spritely, engaging, and well cared for. She is growing up as she weaves her way through a world of confusing mirages, unspoken rights and wrongs, and the inconsistencies of adult behaviors.</p>

<p>In dreams ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She bravely meets the frightening and comforting lady in blue who returns night after night to stand by her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We usually consider archetypal figures—which are there to help—as being most important in our dreams… but they are not the only ones. Who we draw into our dreams as guides and helpers is influenced by our personal history and our stage of life. </p>

<p>The size of emerging problems, our belief system, our intentions for direction in life, and unconscious drives all combine to govern who will show up in dreamtime to assist us. </p>

<p>Even more so than in waking life, those who come to us in dreams allow us to grow spiritually. Respecting our gift of free will, they rarely tell us what to do. Their unstated perspective is a universal one that transcends the needs of the dreamer’s ego and focuses on the collective Whole. </p>

<p>The more we consider the seemingly simplistic question of who is the most important person in our dreams, the more complex the question becomes. Adding to the complexity is the fact that we ourselves are participants in our dreams - if sometimes only as unseen observers. </p>

<p>With the realization that the power of the universe embodied in love can be focused on us as we dream, we are drawn to an awareness of our own deep value. The dream in all of its quiet, veiled power comes to celebrate us as half-asleep dreamers, who when awake can be enormously vital and important contributors to the welfare of Humanity. </p>

<p>So we might then conclude that the most important person in your dreams very well may be <em>YOU!</em> ∞</p>

<p>Although I regularly recall several dreams a night (actually, in the wee hours of the morning), it has been a long time since I’ve been moved to record them or been touched by the muse to write articles about them. Nonetheless, I treasure my dream state and trust that it mindfully influences my waking life in a positive, albeit mysterious manner. I always try to be patient, note patterns and incubate for understanding.</p>

<p>For the past year, I have been plagued by anxiety dreams with a recurring theme: futilely attempting to pack a suitcase amid chaos. Too many things, so little time and space. A cast of thousands. I awaken exhausted. Now, on the surface, the meaning of these dreams is far from mysterious. In less than a year, I am anticipating a move. The very idea is stressful to me: uprooting from a neighborhood I love; harboring misgivings about whether or not I am making the right decision; all the red tape and masking tape. Change is hard. I get it! I get it! Is this unrelenting barrage on the part of my unconscious really necessary? But, of course, there is way more to the message than meets the closed eye! In waking life, I have become obsessed with the negative changes happening to San Francisco: <em>Manhattanization</em> at an exponential rate; more and more tall buildings going up; overcrowding of parks and busses; excessive, unceasing noise pollution; newcomers with, not flowers in their hair, but cellphones in their ear; rampant greed displacing long time residents of moderate means. My anger and bitterness and utter heartbreak were eating me alive. I knew that I had to either make peace with the changes or leave my beloved city. Then I dreamt...</p>

<h3>KISSING THE BEAR (April 3, 2014)</h3>

<p><em>I am walking around San Francisco. It is so changed that I cannot easily find my way. Van Ness Avenue (Route 101) has turned into a one lane, serpentine roadway with electric trolleys. I just miss one (trolley), and realize that if I don’t start running, I will be very late to my destination.</em></p>

<p><em>I make my way through narrow alleys with older architecture reminiscent of European cities, but then emerge into a totally modern/futuristic area with shiny, wide and colorful square buildings that are for the most part only 4 or 5 stories high; one is constructed of mirrored glass with black and red stripes. There are few skyscrapers and many spacious, clean plazas and no automobiles or mobs of people. As I continue to run furiously, I get the idea of being in two places at once, so I visualize myself in the place I am supposed to be right now: helping my friends to sort things out and pack. The room is gigantic and full of people folding and trying on clothing. It reminds me of a bargain basement sale. I see myself there calmly mixing and mingling and lending a hand.</em> </p>

<p><em>Suddenly a gigantic brown bear—the size of a dinosaur-- plops itself down in the middle of the plaza. Everyone starts screaming and scattering, except one woman. It is L. from my neighborhood. I stop running and watch with awe as she floats up to the bear’s monstrous head and kisses it gently on the lips.</em></p>

<p>When I awake, I know that this is a special dream, the one I have been waiting for. Immediately, I write it down and start composing this piece for <em>Dream Network Journal</em>. I feel energized rather than anxious, which had been the case for months now when it was time to get up and face ‘reality.’ My chronic block against thoughtfully examining my dreams lifted and ideas and associations began flowing. </p>

<p>The most dramatic image in my block-buster dream, without a doubt, is the larger-than-life bear. Official emblem for the California Republic, and incidentally enough, also for the Italian region of Abruzzi, where my grandmother was born. The woman ‘L.’ who fearlessly approaches the beast, lives in my neighborhood in ‘real’ life. Polk Gulch is one of the areas in San Francisco that is in the process of drastic transformation. On three sides of the older, rent-controlled apartment house where she has resided for many years, the buildings are being torn down and replaced by high-rise, high cost condominiums. </p>

<p>After months of expressing justifiable rage and helplessness at the relentless noise and dust and encroaching darkness, she took the bull by the horns—or should we say, the bear by the jaws—and boldly initiated a transformation of her own by embracing the change and the changers. The owner and other tenants of L’s building rallied around her to mediate certain conditions; for instance, the landscaped inner courtyard with Bocce Ball courts and barbeque grills that is part of the new complex will be accessible to them, also. And she convinced the foreman of the construction crew to prune the sprawling avocado tree in their backyard for no charge, saving the landlord a great deal of money or the possibility of having to destroy it. The last time I ran into L. she was beaming and insisted on giving me a tour of the construction sites, focusing on the positive aspects: “See how much wider the side walk is now?” and “No more ‘used condom alley’ out my side window.” </p>

<p>So, it’s no wonder that L. showed up in the dream in the role that she did. And what of the dreamer’s role? I am directed toward helping my friends ‘sort things out and pack.’ Here we go again with that recurring theme, except this time, the atmosphere is calm rather than chaotic— once I encounter the Embracer of Change kissing the Bear. </p>

<p>The day before I had the dream, I met with an old, dear friend, who also feels negatively impacted by the onslaught of changes going on around her. Instead of giving one another support, we ended up arguing and pitting our anger and fear against each other. I was particularly distraught because M. in her youth was a great source of strength and inspiration for me, by the very virtue of her ability to adapt to new situations as she navigated around becoming a slave to the Status Quo. </p>

<p>The dream made it clear that I need to ‘bear’ the transforming cityscape in a more constructive manner in order to help M. and other friends who are feeling even more vulnerable and scared than I am—especially those with less financial resources and options (which the dream alluded to via the suggestion of a bargain basement). Unlike the other characters that are rummaging through clothes and preparing to leave, the dreamer has a choice of being in two places at once: in the plaza with the Bear and in the basement with her friends; in addition, she exists both in the dreaming and waking realm. </p>

<p>Curiously enough, although it is my dream-self that is running through San Francisco’s distant future—one that has evolved beyond the seemingly short-sighted, unenlightened changes that are happening right now, it is not until my waking-self recalls the dream that I realize how the City presented in the dream is actually in tune with my idealistic hopes and visions: No cars. Narrow, meandering roadways offering environmentalysound public transportation. Few sky-blocking buildings. Lots of light, greenery and open space. Older architecture preserved (or rebuilt?) to honor the past. Ah, yes, I could embrace changes like that! So why does my dream-self not take notice of the details of her gloriously redesigned (though barely recognizable) homeland? Could it be to remind me that I must not get too attached to any particular change—good or bad— because, it too, will change? </p>

<p>And why does the theme of change manifest in the form of an animal? Perhaps to convey the concept that change is part of the natural order of things. Which is not to say that we, as humans, should not question change or completely capitulate to it. </p>

<p>We <em>do</em> have the power to positively influence the undesirable transformations by kissing the bear, so to speak, rather than fleeing from it or wildly charging it with spears. The dreamer is inspired by L.’s amazing way of interacting with the Bear and stops running. She has reached her destination: a state of mind in which she can be in harmony with this powerful representative of change as well as with those it is most affecting, including herself. The Bear is no longer <em>in the way</em>, but <em>is</em> the way. </p>

<p>In her position above ground, the dreamer is indicative of the outer circumstances I need to <em>adjust</em> to; her simultaneous presence in the basement, often a symbol for the unconscious, points to the <em>inner</em> workings I need to <em>adjust</em>— namely, my attitude and perspective. So then, I am at once the changer and the object of change; I am invited to take an active part in harnessing the unstoppable forces that are altering my world. I can evolve beyond the mentality of <em>victim</em> and <em>perpetrator</em>. </p>

<p>The sorting and packing scenario speaks to a more obvious and minor concern (Ursula Major and Minor!): changing my address. In the larger scheme of things, this is not a big deal—especially since I will still be residing in San Francisco. Nonetheless, the prospect has been the cause of enough anxiety to get the attention of my unconscious; thus, the series of dreams about preparing to relocate—whose multiple meanings/messages I am just beginning to cultivate. For example, another association that I am exploring is Bear as spirit guide … considering that the creature appeared in the dream by dropping out of the sky. And do I ever need the steadfast presence of a Higher Power to encourage me to remain strong and mindfully detached in the trials ahead! The changes to San Francisco are happening over night, but my ability to better deal with them will be an ongoing challenge. Bear is not only a bastion of strength, but knows when to lie low, disengage from the battles of life for awhile; hibernate and then emerge a bit more vulnerable, grateful and eager to seek out the miracles of a renewed landscape.</p>

<p>As winter turns to spring, one change depends upon and precipitates another. The transformed San Francisco that so pleased the awakened dreamer could not have come into being without the nightmarish transition that is currently taking place. Learning to embrace the smaller transitions can help us to prepare for greater ones; the time may indeed come when I need to let go of San Francisco and move on—if not during the course of my life, then most certainly at the end of it. For, there is no escaping the greatest transition and transformation of all. I’m sure that even the passage from this life to the next—the most inevitable and all encompassing of changes—can be negotiated with a fearless, open-heart if we pay attention to and honor our dreams. Easier said than done, but I feel blessed to be taking the first small steps with Bear at my side. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong><em>“When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em></strong></p>

<p>I first heard those words nearly twenty years ago, in a dream. They have haunted me ever since. In that equation’s utter simplicity, it seems to me, a deep ecological truth about relationships emerges. </p>

<p>In the dream, <em>I stand on a steep sloping river bank of exposed dirt and mud. A friend and I watch helplessly as a lone figure proceeds to cut down the last standing tree on the desolate river bank. As I observe the final bit of green life lean sharply and tumble to the barren ground, an unspeakable sadness rises within me. At that moment, my friend says solemnly, “When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em></p>

<p>On one level, it was ironic to hear these words from my friend, since in waking life, he graduated from the University of Chicago with an MBA and firmly believed in the “Chicago School” of economic thought, which held that the free market would provide for everyone’s needs by properly valuing all items, according to the laws of supply and demand. But having canoed with my friend as a Boy Scout, backpacked with him across wilderness mountain passes in Colorado and New Mexico, and sipped cold water from alpine streams, I knew there was another side of him that valued the beauty and great harmony of nature. </p>

<p>As an adult, I tried to discover what economic value he and the Chicago School’s free market system placed on nature. What was the value of a healthy environment? What was the value of a well functioning ecosystem? How did this economic approach calculate global sustainability? Like many discussions with economists at that time, I found that a properly functioning ecosystem seemed a “given.” We did not have to be concerned about it; the natural world had been built into the equation as an economic assumption. </p>

<p>Yet in this dream, my friend provides an answer with a new and startling economic equation devoid of assumptions and givens. <em>When you harm Nature, you harm yourself</em>. Suddenly the fundamental economic principle of the environment seemed clear: When you deplete nature, you deplete yourself. When you hamper nature, you hamper yourself. When you threaten the proper functioning of nature, you directly threaten yourself. Subtracting from nature, subtracts from you. Enhancing nature, enhances you. Economically and quite practically, my dreamt equation made explicit what economic equations do not: our individual and collective well being is intrinsically connected to Nature’s micro and macro well-being. </p>

<p>Somewhere in history, modern man began ignoring that direct connection with physical nature. Similarly, the rarefied world of economic thought and philosophy dismissed it too. Yet the deeper, archaic, unconscious part of my self, accessible in dreams, still carried the knowledge of this ancient economic equation. A subconscious portion of me knew what had been tragically learned on Easter Island and elsewhere: <em>“When you harm Nature, you harm yourself.”</em> </p>

<p>In dreaming, we possess a connection to this older and wiser portion of our being, which can remind us of ancient truths and guide us to creative realizations and actions—if we do not ignore it. In the final chapter of my recently released book, <strong>Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self</strong>, I relate an interesting dream in which <em>a tall, regally dressed man stopped me and asked me a simple question, “What book do you hold in your hand?” Unsure, I brought the book in front of me and read the title, “Dreams: God’s Forgotten Language by John A. Sanford.” Then suddenly, it dawned on me that I had this book on my book shelf but had never read it. I became lucidly aware... ecstatic.</em> </p>

<p>Upon waking, I pondered the idea that the unconscious portion of my larger self had knowingly and purposefully called this book to my attention as important. But why? In the book’s final chapter, “The God Within,” I find one of the possible answers in Sanford’s conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are not only conscious; we are also unconscious. Unconscious psychic reality is as real and substantial as is our conscious life. It expresses its reality in a hundred ways, one of which is the dream. The center of our conscious life is the ego, the center of our total psyche is the self, which seeks to express through our consciousness the totality of our nature.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By attending to our dreams, we have one means to attend to “the totality of our nature.” Without the connection to dreams, we can easily forget and ignore our broader nature and become trapped in an ego-centric and finite world. </p>

<p>With Sanford’s perspective, the wider circle of interrelationships becomes apparent. Not only, “When we harm Nature, [do] we harm ourself,” but when we ignore and deny the unconscious, we lessen ourselves. We lose touch with our inner nature. It is our inner nature that reminds us of our ancient connections to Nature, others and the larger self—the broad circle of being. The gift of dreaming is the gift of that connection. Through honoring that connection, we can find a way. </p>

<p><strong><em>When you love Nature, you love yourself.</em></strong></p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>“Butterfly Party” Photography by Laura Atkinson</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>As I unlocked the polished white door of my hotel room, I recited the inscribed jet-black lettering that read: "June 12th, Procession of the Unmarried Woman. In which single women walk through the centre of their village looking for a husband. (Palestrina, Italy.)" I felt obligated to check the calendar. Yes, indeed it was June 12th. On an afternoon that supplied an abundance of heavy, dark clouds pregnant with moisture, I had set out on a solo journey to navigate a foreign railway system determined to find my own way to the city. I asked the universe “..please show me some signs to follow…” In retrospect, that fine lettering seemingly indicated the type of day it had been. </p>

<p>Months before, I began selling my belongings; furniture, knick knacks, dishes, paintings and more. I left behind the city apartment which I had called home for 14 years and started my journey to be with my partner of 5 years in his beautiful European country. Too soon after arriving, I found myself on a plane returning to the States. These events would prove to be the pivotal moments for my individualized catalyst of change. </p>

<p>Being an artist, photographer and devoted dream journalist, I had always considered myself to be moderately skillful at recognizing dreamscape symbolism. Admittedly I am not an expert interpreter, but I consider myself capable of identifying their appearances and working with them. As I wandered my way back to the States, uncertain of any predetermined destination, it felt natural to ask my dreams for guidance. My dreams had been my constant friends in the past, but now I was depending on them.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zflies-1.jpg" alt="Butterfly emerging" /></p>

<h3>Thin Veil of a Butterfly</h3>

<p>I dream of being wrapped in thin silk from head to toe. It is wrapped around my legs and arms, quite difficult to move. I wiggle my arms above my head and push my hands outward against the silk. Through its transparency I am able glimpse a view to a new world…</p>

<p><em>7/12/10</em></p>

<h3>A Visit to the Butterfly Garden</h3>

<p>It was my second visit to the garden nursery in Rhode Island. The warm, milky sunshine and abundance of flora provided a sweetly scented backdrop to what would be the beginning of an ongoing and wondrous experience in synchronicity. With my camera strapped around my neck, I walked upon a pebbled walk-way through a beautiful butterfly garden. Like fidgety toddlers, the butterflies were not behaving and refused to sit for the portraits I longed to take. Rarely would they land on a flower and if they did it was never long enough to catch their image. I shook my head with impatience and was ready to put my camera away. </p>

<p>From the corner of my eye I caught sight of a grey-blue painted, metal chair sitting alone at the corner of the garden. Delicately dangling from the curved edge of the chair was the chrysalis of a Monarch butterfly. It captivated me, those fine details of tightly folded orange and black wings that could be seen through the translucent casing. As I gazed upon it, my dream from earlier that month immediately entered my consciousness. I became the solitary cheerleader for the emergence of this little creature. I stayed with the Monarch for over 45 minutes as it struggled from its outer shell. In my mind I heard unspoken words <em>“You cannot rush a butterfly,”</em> nor can you help it break free of its cocoon, otherwise the risk exists of damaging delicate wings. I simply watched and waited patiently while I slowly snapped photographs of the small miracle unfolding before my eyes.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Consignment Store</h3>

<p>After arriving in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I was introduced to a lovely little consignment store. Nestled among four butterfly dessert plates was Jung’s book <strong>Synchronicity</strong>. Having never read it before, I purchased it, thinking: “Well isn’t that a nice coincidence!” Little did I know that this synchronicity of change and butterflies was still in play. </p>

<p><em>8/24/2010</em></p>

<h3>The Mountain Top</h3>

<p>I drove with my car windows down to an overlook pass on the top of Buffalo Mountain, my camera and Jung’s <em>Synchronicity</em> on the passenger’s seat. I parked my car and grabbed my newly purchased book. It was at that moment a lemonade-yellow butterfly fluttered in through the passenger side window, landed on my arm for a few moments, and then flew out the driver’s side window. My internal dialog asked: <em>Is this a dream? Am I awake?</em> And my inner voice answered my question with another question: <strong><em>Does it make a difference?</em></strong> I decided to simply be moved with the moment, enjoy the metaphor, the beauty, the symbolism, and just become present with the experience. I followed the flight pattern of this single yellow butterfly as it landed on a group of soft-purple milk thistles. Then I watched in awe as at least a dozen more multi-colored butterflies of various species began landing on the flowers surrounding it; each one, carried by the soft wind, landing right before my eyes. Among the many there was a Monarch with its recognizable markings, a deep black butterfly with metallic blue luminescence spotted with pumpkin orange and white droplets, a butterfly speckled with colors of curry and saffron, and my special lemonadeyellow butterfly sitting tall on the highest thistle. Softly and gently they went about their daily business of sipping nectar and picking up pollen, each pausing briefly on the tips of the thistle. I stood alone for an hour on top of the blue-green mountain with only the butterfly-party as my company as I captured their images.</p>

<p><em>8/25/2010</em></p>

<p>So how do I define the butterfly experience? Great question. I had been navigating without a map for several weeks, asking the universe to provide guidance, some signs about the path I am on; provide some sort of divine inspiration I could draw upon. And in response, my dreams answered as did the collection of “coincidences” happening with my eyes wide open. </p>

<p>The continuing butterfly events were dreamlike and awe-inspiring. With my camera I have been intentionally, physically and symbolically “shifting my focus.” My 20/10 eyesight provides minor details at great distance on the horizon, but in doing that so frequently, I often fail to see what’s right in front of my eyes. What I had been doing is purposefully noticing and appreciating the finer details. </p>

<p>This series of experiences not only raised the bar but it shifted it as well. It triggered a new awareness from within, and united it with a new appreciation for symbols and synchronicities. Just as I am capable of interpreting the metaphors and symbols that dreams provide, the time has come to start acknowledging and working with the signs and symbols while awake. Quite possibly, this is what it is all about. Shifting focus to see the microcosm, the macrocosm, the foreground, the background, connecting it all and being open to “seeing” it all, including the coincidences that thread it all together. </p>

<p>I will openly embrace synchronicities that may unfold in both future waking and sleeping dreamscapes, for I know that my personal transformation is not over. You cannot rush a butterfly. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>At a most fascinating time in my life when I was learning how life can respond in real time to the lessons I was /am learning internally, I had the following experience:</em></p>

<p>One summer night, I am walking on the street towards the subway. A car passes with dogs barking out of the window. The barking reminds me of a quote I had read recently about “listening to the barking dogs of the unconscious” (i.e. noticing subtle experiences like nightmares that try to catch our attention with an important message). The driver stops and asks directions and I gladly tell him how to find the street he is looking for. I continue to the subway, contemplating a principle I seem to be learning in my life, symbolically exemplified by the passing car and barking dogs... about how it is wise to give help to people when they ask for it. I don’t think it applies in every situation but there seems to be some truth to this principle, at least spiritually speaking. I respect all religions and teachers who offer wisdom, and this principle seems to resonate with what Jesus may have meant when he said, <em>“Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened.”</em></p>

<p>As I descend the subway stairs, I am a little lost in my thoughts when I see an old gentleman slowly hobbling down the steps with a cane. Without thinking twice, I ask him if he needs help. He does not look at me but he does say something very odd: <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> He has a British accent, which is quite unusual in Montreal. I’m confused by his response, yet out of good will I repeat my offer to assist him. He shakes his head and says,<em>“It might be a little convoluted, but hopefully you get the point.”</em> </p>

<p>Well, I don’t get it, but I wish him well and continue down another couple flights to the subway. Nearing the bottom, it strikes me that perhaps the old gentleman is trying to help me learn the precise lesson I was contemplating as I entered the subway, since I twice offered him help when he hadn’t asked for it. I immediately run back up two long flights of stairs to speak to him again. </p>

<p>At the speed he was hobbling down the steps—unless he was completely faking it—there is no way he could have either passed me or even turned back and left the subway. In the 20 or 30 seconds it takes me to sprint back to where he <em>should</em> still have been, there was, amazingly, nobody there! </p>

<p>His peculiar statement suddenly seems to make sense. He said, <em>“As I was walking down the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there.”</em> I laugh at the magic of the moment and return to catch my train, no older gentleman anywhere to be seen. ∞ </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Our primary role as dream networkers and educators is simply to make room for the dream in everyday life. The dream is the 'teacher' and primary source of knowledge and information. The dreamer is the one who learns to 'respond' to the dream. The dream-worker is the learner par excellence of the dream. Our role is to constantly open ourselves to the new, the fresh and the challenging lessons that the dream brings to us that challenges our pre-ordered conceptions of what is. We are 'blind-guides' who serve the dreamer's path and by serving we are led with the dreamer to the heart of the dream and to the light that illuminates the dreamer's path. As we soften our biases we come to experience a richer and wider realm of experience.</p>

<p>As we walk this path with dreamers who are also exposed to the web and fabric of life in its deepest reservoir of meaning. If we allow ourselves to be open, then we find ourselves participating in an increasingly wide network of inquiry and relationships.</p>

<p>As dream networkers and educators we must see that our work reaches into every avenue of life. Our models of interaction and creation must reach into the heart of society's myths, structures and beliefs if they are to have relevance. Our methods of relating to dreams must also expand and grow as new understanding unfolds in the society around us.</p>

<p>There is a quiet revolution taking place in higher education from teacher centered learning (pedagogy) to learner centered learning (andragogy). In business a quiet transformation is taking place in organizations that are inverting the organizational chart—the employer is manager; employees engage in setting policy, benefits and often share equally in the profit; the customer is leader. The CEO is growing more concerned with doing the right things in contrast to doing "things" right. Vision, according to Naisbit in <em>Reinventing the Corporation</em>, is the link between dream and action. It is important that this kind of transformational value consciousness be reflected in evolution of the dream network if it is to have any social relevance in the world.</p>

<p>In an evolving dream network the emphasis will be more on results and relationships than on structure, method, process and form. We will recognize that our intra-psychic relationships are most transformational when we perceive ourselves in winning partnerships with our dream characters. Likewise, we will realize the increased value of dream sharing with those around us as a way to deepen the level of understanding and intimacy in all our relationships.</p>

<p>We will encourage dream partnerships to deepen our relationships with others and with ourselves. Our role as dream workers will be to facilitate increased dream literacy and to nurture the space that allows the dream to be expressed in everyday life.</p>

<p>Dream groups can serve a variety of purposes. Some provide short term opportunities to learn particular approaches to dream work or to learn about particular information about dreams and dreaming. Some dream groups serve primarily as a way for peers to share and work with their dreams. Other groups provide for more in depth work on dreams with the help of an experienced guide. Another level is for serious dreamers to develop their dream partnership skills for working with other dreamers.</p>

<p>Dream institutes and centers can emerge as networking points in a wide scale communications network committed to the vision of 'making room for the dream' in society at large. Here dreamers can find support for discovering and refining their own proficiency in working with their own dreams and the dreams of others. New discoveries can be explored, tested and shared with other dream sharing groups and individuals.</p>

<p>In <em>Reinventing the Corporation</em>, Naisbit says that the basic skills required for the new era consists of thinking, learning and creating. We must go beyond these three linear skills in order to function in a non-linear world defined by diversity, fluidity, complexity and high risk. To do this we must learn new and powerful ways to access, explore and express the inner wisdom of our dreaming mind. We can acquire new skills for transforming: our beliefs, outworn values and institutions—so that they can be responsive to the complex, costly conditions facing us. This is our greatest challenge, the building or a network of dreamers who are empowered to act congruently and responsively in a rapidly transforming world.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong><em>Children are having nightmares related to the coronavirus. Children cannot fully escape from the relentless, graphic stories in the media about the inability to breathe, body bags, needles and 500,000 dead. These stories along with the anxieties of the adults around them get transformed into terrifying dreams containing horrific monsters. We need to listen to those nightmares. We need to avoid the old standard attempts at comforting children by telling them "Don't worry, it was just a dream." Such comments do not work!</em></strong></p>

<p>Many children, maybe most, do not share dreams. We can ask them to tell us their dreams. Care must be taken, however, on how to do it. The best way is to simply begin sharing our own dreams (in edited form) with them. Children respond at their own pace by telling their dreams. Listen, listen, listen and respond, "uh, huh, yes, oh?, yes, whew, really!, wow". If it's a nightmare, a response such as "Wow, how would you have wanted the dream to be or how would you have wanted it to turn out?" could be a good next step followed by more listening.</p>

<p>If the child isn't comforted by simply telling the nightmare, then ask the child if he or she wants to draw the dream with a “better ending”. When the child begins drawing and asks for help, avoid suggestions regarding content. Such suggestions disempower children. If they are really stuck, then consider saying something like: "Well, you know, it's your dream and you could put anybody in it you want to have help you". If then, they ask if the person they've chosen is ok, simply repeat, "Well, it's your dream" or something of the sort. In some cases, however, a monster may be so threatening that the child will want to kill it. It is important to tell the child that we are not allowed to kill monsters. Doing so would turn us into monsters.</p>

<p>Children’s responses can be wonderfully creative. I recall one very small, meek, and fragile five year old boy who tugged at my heartstrings as he described his nightmares in which a fearsome monster terrified him night after night. When given the opportunity to draw this monster, he went through a radical abrupt transformation. His face became grotesque. His voice became sharp-edged and raspy as he yelled, “I’ll draw a monster so scary that it will scare the other monster away”. He drew his own scary monster and taped it to his bed. It worked. He slept a whole lot better with his protector right next to him. We can smile knowing that his parents slept a whole lot better too.</p>

<p>We need to empower our children. Dealing with their dreams and nightmares in the ways I've suggested is empowering and can be amazingly comforting for them. Such an approach is love in action.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It was time to dig those old dream journals out of the basement. Yes, they were all there stored in plastic storage containers, thirty-three years worth. The early journals were 9½ by 6 inch spiral notebooks. That spiral format had many advantages. Those notebooks could be opened and laid flat and were easy to write in even when lying in bed. And, the day’s events could be recorded on the left side with the resulting dreams of the next morning beginning on the right. They also came in all different colored covers adding a bit of fascination to them. Years later, larger format spirals replaced the small ones only to be replaced still later by three ring binders. </p>

<p>With all of those journals, the question was where to start. An approach that included spot reviews of dreams from ten, twenty, and thirty years ago was appealing. Opening one of the containers, however, revealed the very first notebooks. My plan went out the window. Those early notebooks were just too fascinating to be ignored. My dream work had begun just before my daughter was born. There were the documented worries about Elizabeth who had developed toxemia toward the end of her pregnancy. There was the record of an early dream incubation to let me know what I could do to help her. The dream came through in a simple piece of music, “It’s Sleepy Time down South.” The message was clear. I just need to help her get as much sleep as possible. </p>

<p>The faithfully kept records of days’ events were there too: the exhaustion from getting the nursery ready, even a comment my mother had made that she had climbed up on a chair to hang curtains the day before I was born. There were notes about all the help we had gotten from friends and neighbors. Then of course notes about the joy I experienced when Shannon was born and how amazing it was, just to hold such a precious and beautiful little person. </p>

<p>In true synchronistic fashion, the early journals revealed other things of interest to my current waking life: the name of an old friend that had been eluding me; and toy train dreams that fit in with a problem I’ve been having trying to fix a toy locomotive.</p>

<p>Having given up on the idea of an organized dream search, I followed an impulse to look up the circumstances surrounding the writing of my first article for the Dream Network Journal in 1987. There it was, a note that my article had been published, with a star drawn next to the note showing how pleased I was. </p>

<p>But while looking for references to the DNJ article, I came across a dream of my daughter’s when she was five years old, in her last year of preschool. The dream had been a favorite for years. I remembered it being about a scary monster wearing yellow boots. Because of the dream, I spoke to Shannon’s teacher about little Ritchie, who I recalled wearing yellow boots to school and w known to bite other children. In a quickly arranged conference, the teacher reassured me that Shannon was safe and that she almost never interacted with Ritchie.</p>

<p>As written, however, Shannon’s dream was much different than I remembered. </p>

<p>*I was going that way and I saw a man with big green boots. You know? Like Ritchie’s boots. He was going in big high puddles. I wanted to kiss my mom. He let me kiss you dad because mom wasn’t home. Then he took me home. I’m glad that dream didn’t come true. I don’t like dreams that come true. *</p>

<p>The dream was multi-layered. The meanings, which related to school, big men, high puddles, home, and Shannon’s relationships with her mom and me, are still not entirely clear. On one level, the man represented Ritchie. I had taken action on that assumption. A brief entry the next day indicated that I was with Shannon when she drew pictures of the big man from her dream who wore green boots. Taking control of the big man in her drawings had been effective. He did not return to her dreams. I don’t recall if I had dealt with the dream issue of Shannon’s mom being unavailable or if I encouraged Shannon to share the dream with her mom; but if it had happened today, I would. Her mom and I would have discussed Shannon’s need for reassurance, concerning her mom’s availability. The outcome might have at least resulted in Shannon getting some additional cuddling and an extra kiss or two. </p>

<p>As a young mother herself, I wondered what Shannon would recall of the incident all these years later. Because she lives nearly a day’s drive from me, I scanned and attached the dream journal page to an email and gave Shannon a follow-up call. Shannon said that the dream seemed unusual to her in a couple of ways. In the dream, her mom was not home, but she recalled her mother as always being at home. The dream did not trigger thoughts about her mom being unavailable. Reading the dream, however, did trigger memories of her being a very frightened child. To me, Shannon hadn’t seemed to be a particularly frightened child. During our conversation, I learned about some of her childhood concerns of which I had been unaware. </p>

<p>Eventually our conversation moved back to the present and the topic of availability. Shannon wanted to make sure that I would continue to be accessible to her and the grandchildren. We realized that we hadn’t been visiting as much as we would like. As a result, we scheduled visits that we’re both very much looking forward to.</p>

<p>After putting down the phone, I felt much better about having carted those dream journals around for so long. They not only helped correct and enlarge on old memories, they also confirmed the enduring importance of old dreams. Because dreams are so relevant to the present and come with perfect timing, it may be tempting to discard dreams after they have been read and interpreted, the way we used to discard day old newspapers. Luckily for me, I had kept those old dreams as well as some of my daughter’s. Randomly finding and revisiting one of my favorite dreams of hers was more valuable than finding a gemstone. That old dream had helped strengthen our relationship when she was only five and helped re-strengthen it again over a quarter of a century later. And the icing on the cake was that it provided the catalyst for strengthening relationships with my granddaughter Annabelle, who just happens to be approaching age five, and her three-year-old brother Alex. </p>

<p>After looking at all those old dreams, they with a doubt have relevance for the present and don’t seem to be quite so old after all. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Poseidia Institute was incorporated in 1973 as a Virginia nonprofit organization designed to research and disseminate information on the subject of parapsychology. </p>

<p>Why would the director of a parapsychology research organization be interested in studying dreams? This question makes sense to the person who thinks of parapsychology research as an effort to prove the existence of ESP or extra-sensory phenomena; and, admittedly, most of the respected parapsychology research in America has been conducted along these lines. </p>

<p>However, from its inception, Poseidia Institute began with a different premise - that is we believed that enough research had been conducted to prove to our satisfaction the existence of so-called psychic phenomena, and that the direction of research should be into the possible applications of these phenomena. In many branches of science "applied" study has resulted in considerable growth in understanding.</p>

<p>So we began with a few psychics (or people with demonstrated ESP ability) to determine what seemed to be possible and what methods seemed to achieve the best results. Before long however, by 1976 at the latest, we realized that psychics at Poseidia Institute in particular (as well as psychics in general) were presenting us with a unique theory of how the universe is constructed, and that in order to carry on further meaningful research it would be necessary to accept this theory at least as a working hypothesis. What was the theory? It was this: <em>That consciousness, as distinct from the physical body (brain, mind, etc.), creates what is perceived as reality; that all things have consciousness; and that "reality" might be seen as one vast creative effort occurring in the present moment rather than (as is generally perceived) in linear time/space.</em> </p>

<p>One of the implications of this theory was that, rather than viewing "physical reality" or "waking consciousness" as "real" or "valid" and other, altered states of consciousness as "less real" or "less valid," it might be possible to view states of consciousness (with the discrete components we sometimes label as waking state, hypnogogic state, daydream, dream state, trance, etc.) as a spectrum of creative effort, all being equally valid, real and useful. Obviously, there are myriad other implications which cannot be discussed in an article of this length, but you'll recall that the original question was why would a parapsychologist be interested in dreams. </p>

<p>The answer is that if all states of consciousness are equally real or valid, then dreams (since the majority of people admit to having them) might become the meeting ground for the human race between the possible and the impossible. That is, most people seem to feel it impossible (at least for themselves on any regular basis) to "be psychic", achieve a trance state, or produce ESP; yet these same people will admit to dreaming and remembering their dreams on a regular basis. </p>

<p>My first serious consideration of this idea came in Virginia Beach after I had been experimenting personally with lucid dreaming for over a year. In a conversation with dream researcher Ann Faraday, she said that she felt it was difficult to achieve the lucid state (although she was really talking about lucidity with a one-to-one correlation with physical reality--ie., not only being aware of dreaming while the dream is in progress, but being at a specifically prearranged "physical location" at a specific "time") and that most people could not do it. I started wondering. </p>

<p>During the course of a 1976 <a href="../bcpov6zreedi/an-interview-with-henry-reed">"Dream Helper Project"</a>, a research project sponsored jointly by Poseidia and the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) (described in my book <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, Donning Co., 1980), it occurred to me that if one were to take a group of people, say at various skill levels in dreaming, and ask them to perform certain tasks in the dream state over a period of six months, it tight be possible to learn a great deal about the state of consciousness called dreaming as well as "psychic phenomena". This was the beginning of Poseidia's Dreams<sup>10</sup> (or Dreams to the Tenth Power) research project, which has been going on intermittently over the past three years. </p>

<p>The goal of the project was to determine whether people could dream on command (which many seemed able to do), to investigate the ratio of lucid to non-lucid dreams in this process, and to explore the symbolic content of the reality creation. Obviously there were some other factors involved here which are generally considered to be psychic, like telepathy and precognition; that is, in order to dream together, a group is employing elements of what is generally considered telepathy, and frequently elements of precognition showed up in the dreams as well. </p>

<p>This first six-month project of Dreams<sup>10</sup> was conducted with staff members and other people closely associated with Poseidia, mostly to see if the theory would work or what might happen if people (some of whom had never met and were located up to 500 miles from each other) tried to dream together. Not only did the experiment work and achieve some of the expected results; but, maybe more importantly - it was fun. What we discovered was that other staff members began to dream along, or show up in the project participants' dreams and vice versa. Dreaming together became the subject of more than just the experiment as people began to use their dreams as a way of working together or exploring their feelings toward one another. Elements of this dream research were incorporated in the dream classes regularly taught at the Institute, in part as a means of exploring how easy or how difficult it was for people to achieve this particular "altered, but equally valid and real" state of consciousness. </p>

<p>Finally in 1982 we decided to take the ultimate step with Dreams<sup>10</sup> and select (from over 200 applicants from all over the country) two teams of ten people who were complete strangers to one another, and who had no particular education in either dreaming or parapsychology. The task was simply to see if they could "dream together" over a three-month period. The results of this experiment, which are still being analyzed, were surprising even to us. There's no doubt these people were able to dream on request some fair part of the time, and while they were at it, perform some interesting "psychic" feats. For example, the night Team II went to Cindy's wedding, while Cindy, who thought she hadn't met the goal because she was tired and already knew about her wedding, dreamed she "went to the beach with a group of people". Cindy didn't know the beach was the goal for Team I that same night. </p>

<p>Certainly there are research implications of this material which is why, as a parapsychologist, I am interested in studying dreams along with other states of consciousness. But to me the more important thing, and the reason that I enjoy the approach taken by the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, is the application of the research, or the immediate usefulness of the research for myself and other people. Wouldn't you like to try dreaming together with a group of friends? I personally am interested in the potential counseling applications of group dreaming where, for example, a therapist might work with a family by asking them to dream together between counseling sessions. In my opinion we have barely begun to explore the possibilities of consciousness, either in dreaming or "beyond dreaming". Perhaps if we were willing to accept, even as a working hypothesis, the theory presented by psychics that one state of consciousness is as real or as valid as another, it would help us all to alleviate the problems caused by drawing rigid lines between possible and impossible, real and "just my imagination".</p>

  <p>“Nothing happens unless first a dream.” - Carl Sandburg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to talk to you about <em>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</em>, my current dreaming project. In order to do so it is necessary to first give you a little background about myself and about the fairly unique dreamwork process in which I have involved myself over the past thirty years or so. </p>

<h2>Some History</h2>

<p>I was fortunate that fairly early in my career in that I was asked to direct a small, non-profit organization in Virginia Beach, Virginia, called Poseidia Institute. At that time, the focus of research was on the intuitive process — what made people able to do such things as accurate psychic readings(?), for example. What made it possible for ‘healers’ to ‘cure’ and ‘telepaths’ to give information for someone halfway around the world? </p>

<p>Because these questions were primary to my own research as well, it quickly became clear to me that dreams — whatever else they may be — are the one altered state of consciousness we all share. Therefore, talking to people about dreaming might reduce the general awe in which psychics and psychic phenomena were held, that is when they were not being denied or ridiculed. </p>

<p>So I began with the premise that we are all psychic, that being psychic is our nature. It wasn’t long before the necessity to examine the nature of time and space became important to me as well, since the psychics I knew often talked about alternate realities, or other areas of time and space. </p>

<p>These were interesting times in the field of dreams, during the 1970s. John Herbert, Richard Wilkerson and others summed some of that history up in articles in the last issue of Dream Network. </p>

<p>On the East Coast, Dr. Henry Reed was publishing his <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> for the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE). This journal served the function of bringing dreamers into dialogue. So popular was this quarterly journal that, when the ARE stopped its production, a New Yorker by the name of Bill Stimson decided that something needed to be done to keep the grassroots dream community going. He was so convinced, that he started a small publication of his own, the <em>Dream Network Bulletin</em>, which was an immediate precursor of the Dream Network you now hold in your hand. </p>

<p>The staff of Posiedia Institute was involved in these events, with other editors of the DNB, Suzanne Keyes, and Linda Magallon. We were all volunteers in a project we called <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em>, a group dreaming experiment. </p>

<p>At the same time Henry was publishing the <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em>, he was also conducting his <em>Dream Helper</em> experiments, a process he had devised for getting people incubate dreams to help another dreamer. </p>

<p>In conversation one day, Henry and I decided it might be interesting to see if dream helpers could work with someone they’d never met, or met only briefly. So it was determined that the next person who filled out an application for a psychic reading from one of Poseidia’s staff of very competent psychics would be, if they were willing, the target for a Dream Helper experiment. </p>

<p>The majority of people coming to Poseidia for readings at that time were there for medical assistance, often referred by their doctor or therapist. So when the next application arrived, we invited the young woman to participate in this joint ARE/Poseidia Institute experiment. </p>

<p>What occurred to me the next morning, when the ‘dream helpers’ met to report their dreams—myself among them—was that not only had several members of the group accurately targeted the young woman’s illness, but the dreamers actually appeared to have shared dreams.</p>

<p>This subject of sharing dreams fascinated me so much that I decided to devise some sort of experiment to see if people could share dreams, possibly even lucid dreams, on a planned basis. This was the beginning of a set of experiments which took place over several years. The results of these experiments more than convinced me that spontaneous mutual dreaming is fairly common, though not so commonly reported; I was also convinced that skills such as mutual, and even mutual lucid, dreaming can be developed.</p>

<p>It was out of this background then that I returned in 1996 to The Association for the Study of Dreams. As one of ASD’s earliest members, I had presented at the second ASD conference in Charlottesville, Virginia, but then left dreamwork behind for doctoral work at American University, and later for work as a senior Science Fiction/ Fantasy editor. </p>

<h2>We’ll Cross That Bridge When We Come To It</h2>

<p>So how does all of that bring us to the World Dreams Peace Bridge?</p>

<p>The period between 1985 and 1995 was very important to the study of dreams. In California, Linda Magallon continued the study of mutual and group dreams, finally resulting in her book, <em>Mutual Dreaming</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1997. Interest in dream lucidity continued to grow, supported by activities like Ruth Sacksteder’s Lucid Dream Exchange. </p>

<p>Although there continued to be an interest in both interpretive dreamwork and theoretical dream research, dreamers were also becoming interested in such things as Dr. Stanley Krippner’s ongoing research into Shamanic dream practices around the world, and the work of Australian author, Robert Moss. These researchers and others were talking about the important role dreaming has played in world cultures, apart from the more scientific models of Western culture.</p>

<p>I have often told the story of sitting at a table overlooking the ocean on the terrace of the beautiful University of California Santa Cruz campus, with a group of some of the top experts on dream lucidity. Someone asked how people had first become lucid. One man responded, holding up his hands, “I looked at my hands.” One by one, around the table, people grinned and held their hands in front of their faces in silent homage to Carlos Castaneda who, even if he made it all up, introduced an entire generation of dreamers to lucidity through <em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em>. </p>

<p>During the decade in which I was away from dreamwork, more dreamers had become conversant with theories of time and space presented first by Albert Einstein, followed by an entire group of nuclear physicists and popularized by writers such as Gary Zukov, Michael Talbot, and Fred Alan Wolf. Now it was not so unusual as it had once been for dreamers to believe that possibly consciousness—particularly dreaming consciousness—could extend beyond the boundaries of linear time and cross the boundaries of space. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly the single most important development of the decade was the Internet, where almost as soon as longdistance communication was possible, dreamworkers like the Rev. Jeremy Taylor, John Herbert, Jayne Gackenbach, and Richard Wilkerson were communicating globally with dreamers around the world and constructing Internet dream resources which far outshone anything available to dreamers prior to that time. </p>

<p>When I returned to ASD in 1996, almost the first thing I did was volunteer to moderate the Online Bulletin Board at http://www.asdreams.org. I was fascinated by the potential of the Internet to link dreamers with one another and to provide instant communication. Whereas before, when the <em>‘Dreams to the Tenth Power’</em> research was going on, weeks of sending dream accounts and responses through the mail were discouraging to dreamers. Now communication was instantaneous, free... with the click of a key. </p>

<p>As soon as I began to moderate the Online Bulletin Board, I noticed one less-than-surprising thing: a majority of the questions—from kids writing school papers, from adults with sleep disorders, from dreamers all over the globe—focused on subjects which, heretofore, had been classified under ‘paranormal’ dreaming or ‘anomalous’ dreams. There were questions about out-of-body experiences, about dream telepathy, about mutual dreams and experiences of sleep paralysis. It seemed that this type of dreaming, far from being paranormal, was — if we were to believe the people who came to the Bulletin Board — very normal indeed. </p>

<p>The visitors to the Bulletin Board, some of whom became so regular that we began to call them Boarders, carried on the practice of grassroots dreamwork which began in the seventies. Even though dream interpretation is not done on the Bulletin Board, wideranging questions about dreaming and dreamwork are discussed, with equal participation from therapists, sleep and dream researchers, artists as well as from dreamers themselves. </p>

<p>In the two years after I began moderating the Bulletin Board, Ed Kellogg developed the Paranormal Dreaming Forum on the ASD site, and we began also to create ASD Member Pages, which allowed for members to put up a page online, introducing themselves and their work. It was not long until I conceived a plan for bringing International members even closer, through the medium of the Internet. In 1998, I invited ASD members around the world to participate in the construction of the Online Guide to International Dream Work. This project not only provided a stunning array of multi-language pages for the ASD web site, but it also built a feeling of camaraderie among the ASD members working on the project, even though they lived in Greece, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and many places in between.</p>

<h2>The Effects of 9/11</h2>

<p>Given my sensitivity to the issues of interest to the online dream community, it wasn’t much of a stretch for me, when I saw the televised report of the second plane flying into the Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, to go to the computer and invite people to post their dreams and feelings to the Bulletin Board. I saw the number of precognitive dream reports without surprise and before long I was writing an article called “Dealing With Precognitive Dreamer Guilt,” <a href="http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm">http://dreamtalk.hypermart.net/campbell/dreamer_guilt.htm</a>, which Richard Wilkerson generously published in his online magazine <a href="http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm">Electric Dreams</a>. I was touched by the outpouring of sympathy and understanding, which came to the U.S. from dreamers around the globe. </p>

<p>Then, as the bombs began dropping in Afghanistan, two of my lifelong interests came together with a very loud click. I have been a pacifist ever since, as a graduate student in the 1960s, I did Conscientious Objector counseling for the American Friends Service Committee. </p>

<p>I remembered the plenary speech Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, director of Pacifica Graduate Institute, made at the 1999 ASD Conference in Santa Cruz: <em>‘Dreaming the World.’</em> That lecture caught my attention because Aizenstat was saying what I had believed for years: that people, and all sentient beings, are dreaming the world into existence, all the time. </p>

<p>This is not a new idea, having been the foundation for Aboriginal Australian culture for thousands of years, as well as fundamental to other indigenous cultures. Numerous psychics, such as Edgar Cayce and Jane Roberts, have said the same thing. </p>

<p>In the days following 9/11, it seemed to me that maybe it was time for a practical experiment. If it were true that we are dreaming the world, and if it were true that dreamers all over the world could come out of isolation via the internet, then perhaps we should join together to explore the possibility of dreaming the world into peace. </p>

<h2>The World Dreams Peace Bridge</h2>

<p>In October of 2001, I sent an e-mail to approximately one hundred people: friends, family, those ASD members who had worked on the Online Guide to International Dream Work, inviting them to join me in a discussion group, which I later labeled the first-ever longterm group journaling experiment. There was something that had struck me in my own briefly precognitive dream on the morning of 9/11. In that dream, <em>I was standing in the control tower of an airport, watching as an air traffic control person dealt with an obvious emergency.</em></p>

<p>What struck me about the dream was that, although I was in the control tower, I was only an observer. My dream reminded me that I had the ability to respond, a response-ability to be in control, as we all do if we believe that we are dreaming the world. </p>

<p>In the last issue of <em>Dream Network</em>, Richard Wilkerson labeled this emerging attitude as Dream Activism. In fact, there are other groups now following the model of the World Dreams Peace Bridge, and there are a growing number of dream activists. Is this a new concept? Not entirely. During the time between the emergence of ‘grass roots’ dreamwork and today, many dreamers have recognized that — from a certain position in the dream, often a lucid dream, and sometimes a group or mutual dream — it is possible to act consciously from the dream state, to communicate with others and to participate in creating the magic of reality. </p>

<p>The World Dreams Peace Bridge, which maintains an active membership of around fifty people, is composed of dreamers from around the world: Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, New Zealand, the U.S. and many other places. In its waking form, as a discussion group, the Peace Bridge operates as a support system for dreamers. New ideas are explored; dreams are told; because of its international membership, news is often reported from one country or another before it is picked up by the press. </p>

<p>At the dreaming level, the World Dreams Peace Bridge has acted as a catalyst for creativity. One example of this is the Peace Train Project, which has grown from a dream Jeremy Seligson dreamed in Korea in August 2002. </p>

<p>In the dream, <em>Jeremy was riding with a group of people on a train across the country. The train, which bore a banner calling it the ‘Peace Train,’ ended up at a platform on which President Gore stood.</em></p>

<p>From the dream, when he first recounted it, Jeremy began to muse. What would happen if people all over the world began to create peace trains? What would happen if children were asked to create peace trains? What would peace trains carry? </p>

<p>Other members of the group began to get enthused and now—less than a year later—Peace Train projects and Peace Train workshops have been held or are planned for Korea, Australia, India, Turkey and the United States. UNESCO has praised the Peace Train Project. Jeremy has created a Peace Train song and is working on a video. There will be a Peace Train workshop at the ASD Conference in Berkeley in June. And the Peace Train Project has brought more dreamers to the Peace Bridge. </p>

<p>By the fall of 2002, the World Dreams Peace Bridge had become so active that we needed to create a web site. With the work of webmistress, Liz Diaz—who had already designed a beautiful World Dreams logo—<a href="https://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org/">http://www.worlddreamspeacebridge.org</a> was created. The site, among other things, now houses a marvelous collection of art, which has grown out of the dreams of various peace dreamers. </p>

<p>Most recently, in the time just preceding massive world-wide peace demonstrations against U.S. attempts to convince the United Nations to approve war against Iraq, members of the World Dreams Peace Bridge sponsored a Peaceful Solutions Dream In, inviting not just members of the Peace Bridge but dreamers everywhere to join us in attempting to dream up peaceful solutions to the world’s conflicts.</p>

<p>In my own estimation, these are good questions for all dreamers to consider, not just dream activists. In the work I was doing at Poseidia Institute in the 1970s, I was often told that I was ahead of my time. Recently, when I helped to facilitate ASD’s first PsiberDreaming Online Conference, an online psi event that had participants asking for more, I was told that my first book on dreams, <em>Dreams Beyond Dreaming</em>, published in 1980, had withstood the test of time. But, for myself, I have seen Dream Activism as a natural development, an outgrowth of believing that dreams might predict the future or support such things as lucid/mutual communication. </p>

<p>Much has happened in the past thirty years to convince Western dreamers that we might be creating the world (or many worlds) through our dreams. Dream Activism, or projects like those of The World Dreams Peace Bridge, are no more than our attempt to become increasingly more conscious of what we already know to be possible. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>It all began in a dream telepathy contest, where strange – stranger-than-usual – things happened.</p>

<p>It was 2006, my first year attending the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) annual online PsiberDreaming Conference (PDC), which always includes psi dreaming contests. For this one Beverly D'Urso was “sender,” endeavoring to mentally transmit a target image. We contestants were to post our dreams online; when four pictures were posted we'd each choose which best matched our dream; then judges would select winners with the best “hits.”</p>

<p>On the designated night I took off flying and called out, “Beverly, show me the picture!” I found myself “flying over a snowy scene.... A stretch of bare soil... a very large dog appeared.... Another smaller, darker dog was with him... possibly rescue dogs.... Suddenly I was indoors looking at and hearing an announcement of the answer... pictures of different types of dogs.”</p>

<p>Mary Pat posted her dream just after mine: hers had “reindeer with red leather harnesses... intense cold, rounded hills of snow and ice....” and then, “the image of a dog, nothing else, the background dark.... I realized he was a husky....”</p>

<p>At least four others dreamed of snow. Bob dreamed of a snowball fight, then twice of dogs: one on a bed with him, one on the bedroom floor. Val dreamed her parakeet was “the size of a large dog”!</p>

<p>When the four picture were posted, surprisingly, none had a dog. But one was a scene of snow and bare ground – with two elves looking up into pines: a young one in a gray jumpsuit, a scowling older one in a red pointed cap. Had anyone dreamed the elves? </p>

<p>Yes! Sonia's dreams had a boy in a gray jumpsuit; B.A.'s, a boy, then “a red triangular shape.” Dolores dreamed of two dwarves in pointed red caps. Ilkin got the facial expressions: “Grumbling/curious.... Looking for something.... Snow.” Patricia dreamed of elves sheltering in a tree from a storm; “the dog alerts them....” </p>

<p>Some dreamed evergreens and Christmas scenes. It was like putting together a puzzle. Indeed Ed, an experienced psi dreamer, dreamed that he failed to solve a blue and white interlocking puzzle on a white countertop. He correctly took this as a clue that the dreams of snow were better “hits” than his! </p>

<p>We were delighted when Beverly revealed the target: the elves-in-snow. Then she posted her own dreams from her night of “sending,” including this: “Extremely large dog... climbed into this little bed with me. I was saying, 'No, no, no....'”!</p>

<p>So where did all the dogs come from?</p>

<p>Finally Suzanne disclosed that, the same night, she'd also participated in another dream psi experiment. The target? A team of sled dogs in the snow!</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-0.jpg" width="300px" height="auto" alt="Snow target image with two elves"></img></p>

<p>Discovering these and other complex interconnections unfolded an extraordinary camaraderie. Kathy posted that she was “impressed with the way people are dreaming together – we seem to have woven a tight fabric of related dreams in the last 24 hours: a harmonious dream song....” </p>

<p>I agreed. “What an experience – tuning into shared dream-space with not only Beverly but, as it turns out, all who participated.... Everybody wins by participating and experiencing our connectedness. There could be no greater reward.” </p>

<p>The judges deliberated an extra day, citing “the strange and wonderful things that happened,” then gave ties for first, second and third with a flock of honorable mentions.</p>

<p>I posted, “It was difficult to evaluate my own dreams' relation to the target without looking at everyone else's. Think how fun and rewarding it would be if that were the object of the game! – especially if choosing among possible targets as in [this] contest – treat it as a group dream and say, for instance, “Wow, there's a lot of snow in here! …And look at all the elves. I vote #1 is the target.” </p>

<p>Six years later I helped create just such an event for the 2012 PDC. The Group Remote Viewing Game proved a splendid test of the hypothesis that a group can work together to generate dream clues, then solve a mystery. </p>

<p>But I've told that story elsewhere (IASD's Dream Time magazine). Here, let's play with a less-testable idea: Do people dreaming toward a common goal form something like a group mind? </p>

<p>The target: King Tutankhamun's golden funerary mask. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zfpsig-1.jpg" width="200px" height="auto"></img></p>

<p>The dreams: multiple puzzle pieces, including two or more of each of the following: ancient cities, artifacts, the Middle East, rulers, spiritual figures, temples, ceremonies, statues, portraits, boxes, graves, dimly-lit rooms, mummy-like wrappings, gold – lots of gold. And there were surprising mirrorings in ways dreaming minds interpreted these themes. A few among many oddly intersecting dreams that pointed to the target:</p>

<p>Dale dreamed, “I am traveling to a remote place where I witness some type of ceremony inside a building... possibly a communion.” Jay dreamed “a single image. A flat smooth shiny green leather case... containing a shiny metal plate (paten) with a single large communion host on it.”</p>

<p>Sarcophagus-like, the case holds what many Christians call the body of Christ, considered – as Egyptians considered the Pharaohs – both God and man. But why green? Perhaps because Rita was dreaming of a “magical/mystical... green box”?</p>

<p>Rita also dreamed of a golden “statue of the Mary, the Madonna” while Valley was dreaming of “the embodiment of Mary [with] large dark living eyes.”</p>

<p>No one dreamed “Egypt,” but Carol dreamed initials UR and thought of the ancient Mesopotamian city, while Kate dreamed “a repeating motif of blue and aqua” reminding her of "the detail work on an ancient frieze from Mesopotamia.” </p>

<p>Kate had apparently zoomed in on the mask's lapis lazuli and turquoise inlays. It also has alternating blue and gold stripes; Sharon dreamed gold stripes on a gold-framed portrait of a revered and famous man, while Ed dreamed blue stripes on the head of a powerful, reclining magician.</p>

<p>Now here's another unscientific notion. When people dream together, does the waking world collaborate?</p>

<p>Maria recounted her experience on the night designated for dreaming the target. “I have a model of Tut's sarcophagus [that] toppled over that evening for no apparent reason, obliging me to take notice of it as I set it right again....”</p>

<p>Carol was deliberating which image best matched the group's dreams when when “out of nowhere” an acquaintance told her, “Maybe you were a pharaoh's daughter in a past life.... I thought of you last night when I turned on a movie and watched The Mummy Returns!” </p>

<p>When I revealed the target, Kate was listening to a presentation on her iPod. “The presenter started talking (out of the blue) about Egypt, pharaohs, and how people had said Obama looks like a pharaoh.”</p>

<p>And at that moment Carol heard “Walk Like An Egyptian” on the radio.</p>

<p>A few participants' closing remarks:</p>

<p>Sharon: “So glad we all did what we did together. It does work....”</p>

<p>Maureen: “It's nice to feel that the combined vision, the pieces of the puzzle that each dreamer contributed, each in his or her own way – really made this event work.... I'm very, very impressed with the success of this event and the rich psi content of the dreams....The communal focus felt extraordinary to me.”</p>

<p>Laurel, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.: “'We must give an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in our individual societies.' Seems like this game has been an excellent example of a group coming together in this way.”</p>

<p>Tony: “It's been a lot of fun and left me with a very strong feeling of – what's next!”</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>READING THE RED BOOK, Spring Journal Books, 317 pp</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>When The Red Book of Carl Gustav Jung was published, it caused an immense stir, offering readers a plethora of new mysteries and depth psychology insights. I cannot predict that this interpretation will set so large a wave of interest in motion, but it may. <strong>READING THE RED BOOK</strong> certainly deserves attention. It is a work of wealth in itself. And you may find it of interest that the author confesses not to be a Jungian and yet he uses Jung’s often idiosyncratic spiritual quest—for soul, Self and the God-yet-to-come—to confront and challenge the materialist psychology dominating our materialistic society’s science of mind and soul. </p>

<p>From the onset, Sanford Drob is clear about what he has done and how he has done it. Beginning at the Introduction, it is worth listening into the author as he explains his intention. Drob’s first paragraph is this: “Jung held that dreams are challenges to the assumptions and complacency of the ego, compensation for one-sided conscious attitudes, or messages from the unconscious that prompt us to question the value and direction of our current mode of thinking, feeling and living. By this defi nition, Jung’s The Red Book...is akin to a dream... Like many dreams the <em>dream</em> that is The Red Book is at once magnificent and grotesque.” </p>

<p>A page later, the author sets before us the major points of his investigation: “Although I have endeavored to be balanced and as comprehensive as possible... I have become convinced that while The Red Book narrative centers around Jung’s’ soul-finding journey, its greatest value may be its ideas on such themes as God, humanity, madness, chaos, death, science, reason, knowledge, logic, and evil.”</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Drob introduces us to a confession, his method, and his intention. He continues: “I am not a Jungian. While I believe that my treatment of The Red Book is a sympathetic one, I do not hesitate to raise questions about Jung’s approach to various issues and his suggestion that spiritual wisdom and enlightenment must involve an inner, solitary journey. In many instances, without providing anything resembling an answer, I raise questions that the reader will want to consider for him or herself.” </p>

<p>Drob concludes his informative Introduction with the following lines: “The immense size and weight of the facile edition, along with the haunting beauty and mystery of its illustrations leads one to approach Jung’s Red Book with a certain caution—it is hardly the sort of work that one curls up with in bed… and yet it is a work that, above all else, must be read; read, and then studied and reflected upon… In the present work, I propose to read The Red Book, and, in the course of this reading, wrestle with the questions it asks, *on the hope of experiencing something new, seeing life from a new perspective and perhaps being personally transformed in the process.” *</p>

<p>Sanford Drob is thorough in his investigative exploration of The Red Book’s Psyche Odyssey of CG Jung: an interior journey, an intellectual, emotional, spiritual going down into the depths—even Jung’s descent into personal hell, madness, chaos—to seek the alchemic matrix that brews the dynamics of individuation, the nexus of soul and self, and to search out the Unknown God who addresses emergent identity through the individuation process. One major result of this Odyssey is what Dr. Drob comes to refer to as “dream theology,” rendered out of The Red Book journey as dream... a dream of human psychology, which came to provide fertile ground for Jung’s psychology of dreams and dreaming. </p>

<p>Drob is also thorough in his routing back over Jung’s dreamlike rite of passage. Unfortunately, I cannot be so as a reviewer and must yield to the limitations of my spatial condition. Let me but cite several passages from the cornucopia of <strong>READING THE RED BOOK.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>P.3:</strong> “Jung’s goal in The Red Book was to encourage others to discover their own soul and assume responsibility for their own lives.” </p>

<p><strong>P.5:</strong> “Jung’s discussion of the spirit of the depths raises the question of whether there is...a form of gnosis that is not conditioned by time and place... It is the quest for such a trans-temporal, trans-cultural... understanding that fueled Jung’s early interest in mythology and conditioned his inquiries into the archetypes of the collective unconscious.” </p>

<p><strong>P.6:</strong> “For Jung, the supreme meaning, which gives rise to the image of the God-yet-to-come, is the melding together of meaning and absurdity, sense and nonsense.” </p>

<p><strong>P.22:</strong> “Jung asserts that meaninglessness and chaos is the ‘other half of the world,’ and no one can be complete or have a full understanding of the world without embracing its chaotic and meaningless elements.” </p>

<p><strong>P.23:</strong> “The descent into chaos is perilous, but it also yields great reward.” <strong>(Jung)</strong> ‘If we open up to chaos, magic also arises .’”</p>

<p><strong>P.29:</strong> “In Rudolph Otto’s terms, Jung seeks a numinous experience, an experience of the mysterium, that fearful yet fascinating and aweinspiring rapture that lifts one from the despair of the everyday and allows one to experience self and the world as bathed in the darkness of terror and/or the light of wonder, awe, and spiritual affirmation.” </p>

<p><strong>P.260:</strong> “The Red Book has many characteristics that are typically associated with dreams: it is filled with strange, haunting and at times frightening images; its narrative is surreal and, most importantly, it arrives into our awareness in a manner that is completely discontinuous and disruptive of our business...as usual” </p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> the individuation process, with connectives between soul, Self and an emergent God-image and in its dream-actuals and dreamlike episodes, disrupts established patterns of identity for the coming into being of mature identities, through dialectic developments and revelatory dialogues. The dream of The Red Book parents the work of depth psychology; out of the depths emerge contours of a dream theology. ∞</p>

    ns1:description """<p>During a recent trip to San Francisco I had the opportunity to attend the play "A Woman Dreams in a Seafood Restaurant" at the Habitat Center with two other dreamworkers, Sally Shute and Donna Levreault.</p>

<p>A mood is set as the waitress sets the table. The customer enters, hurried, depressed and withdrawn. The waitress displays an overbearing presence and clearly patronizing attitude as she repeatedly serves food that is unedible and must be returned to the kitchen. </p>

<p>As the woman's frustration grows, each trip to the kitchen triggers a deeper drift into a dream-like torpor emphasized by effective lighting and sound effects.</p>

<p>The disgusting food, the shadow personalities of the woman and the the birth of darkness are portrayed by various dream characters. The first and most colorful is a lobster chef who forces the woman to eat a lobster which has been served in lieu of her rejected food. The second figure is a dark figure of a machine having all the disgusting qualities necessary to turn even the audience's stomach with its snorting and disgusting eating habits. This second figure joins the woman for dinner. </p>

<p>As the play moves along the disgust gathers momentum until a grey mythical god delivers the waitress to the scene out of swaddling clothes. Soon the waitres s gives birth to black bat-like figures which the machine promptly gobbles down with disgusting relish. And so it goes. After the dream ends and the bill is presented in which the woman must pay an exorbitant fee - she leaves in confusion. </p>

<p>Below the colorful persona and art lies a deep portrayal of hopelessness and disgust of life in isolation amidst the shadow of technology. There is no observable indication of any healing elements in the dream or of possible transformation except in the direction of darkness. </p>

<p>This mode of theater has some obvious potential in the use of effects and costumes to portray dream states. The particular play "A Woman Dreams in a Seafood Restaurant" leaves the viewer confused and with a sense of disjointed incompleteness, not unlike waking from a disgusting dream that requires a considerable amount of dreamwork. One is tempted to want to re-enter the dream and re-enact it.</p>

<p>Like the times in which we live there is a sense of hopelessness and the dream is left unfinished. In the midst of this theater in which we all play the dream worker's task is clear. </p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Thomas Berry, Dreamer of the Earth: The Spiritual Ecology of the Father of Environmentalism, edited by Ervin Laszlo and Allan Combs, A Worldshift Book published by Inner Traditions, 144 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>What Arne Naess is to the foundations of Deep Ecology, Matthew Fox to Creation Spirituality and Theodore Roszak to a popularization of Eco-Psychology, so is Thomas Berry to Environmentalism and Eco-Theology. Berry stands forth as a beloved uber-champion of the Great World—the eco-shamanic, holistic, global alchemy of our time—as a leading worldshift and crisis necessitated re-Earthing pioneer, serious celebrant of the “spontaneities within us,” cosmologist and pathfinder, dreamer of responsibility, visionary of maturity, defender of biotic democracy. Berry referred to himself as a “geotheologian.” This volume not only showers accolades on the subject but shows how easy it is to love the man through his dedicated genius as well as his life of wonderment, humility and honesty. </p>

<p>Here is an impressive way of opening the door to the unfamiliar or revisiting the devoted work of Father Berry, an American monk of the Passionist order. The book, a small cornucopia, contains a significant forward and ten essays from engaged contributors. As Thomas Berry is personally highly regarded, I hasten here and delve directly into extensive quotations from the forward and the single essay chosen for highlight. I trust that my evaluation will provide a fertile parcel of common ground. </p>

<p><strong>Thomas Berry, Dreamer of the Earth</strong> is edited by Ervin Laszlo, twice nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and founder of the Club of Budapest, and Allan Combs, professor at the California Institute of Integral Studies. Let me begin opening the pages with this from Dr. Laszlo’s Forward: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Clearly we are facing critical problems, but what is it that needs to be done? Berry’s advice remains clear and timely. Basically he tells us, ‘What we need, what we are ultimately groping toward, is the sensitivity required to understand and respond to the psychic energies deep in the very structure of reality itself…”</p>
  
  <p>“Accepting the spontaneities of the universe, calls for a vision that is dreamlike. Imagination functions most freely in dream vision, and so we tend to associate creativity with dream experience. ‘The dream comes about precisely through the uninhabited spontaneities of which we are speaking,’says Berry. ‘In the beginning was the dream. Through the dream all things were made, and without the dream, nothing was made that has been made.’…” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it is to be understood that this dream—dream of Earth and dream of creation; the cosmic dream—is the divine dream. This in turn brings into reference one of the books of bodywork psychologist and physicist <a href="../@arnoldmindell">Arnold Mindell</a>, The Dreammaker’s Apprentice. </p>

<p>Continuing from the Forward: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is through a complex, continuous and subtle interaction that we maintain ‘our intimate presence to the function of the earth community and to the emergent process of the universe itself.” </p>
  
  <p>“Berry’s basic insight remains entirely valid. ‘The present situation is so extreme that we need to get beyond our existing cultural formation and back to the primary tendencies of our nature itself, expressed in the spontaneities of our being.'” </p>
  
  <p>“The brightest glimmer of hope shimmering at the darkening horizon of the current global crisis is, in Berry’s words, that ‘the universe is revealing itself to us in a special manner just now. Also the planet Earth and the life communities of the Earth are speaking to us through the deepest elements of our nature’.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To encounter the phrases, <em>in the beginning was the dream; the primary tendencies of our nature itself, the spontaneities of our being</em>, is to feel a deep excitation and arousal that engenders hope while even more impressively demanding dedication. </p>

<p>Next, the essay I have chosen to look into is <em>INSCENDENCE—The Key to the Great Work of Our Time</em> (pgs 42-71) by Bill Plotkin. Plotkin is a depth psychologist and wilderness guide, author of <em>Soulcraft</em> and <em>Nature &amp; the Human Soul</em>. </p>

<p>The term Great Work may be familiar from alchemy and variations played out by Jung and his followers. Inscendence, however, is a word requiring definition. Plotkin (following Father Berry) gives us this: “Inscendence”—as over against the other worldliness of transcendence—is ‘sinking back into the source of everything,’ during which we no longer belong to the world in our old ways… There in the presence of ‘the source of everything’ we hope to be suffused by and informed by what Berry calls ‘the guidance and the powers of the Earth’.”</p>

<p>This has to do with Earth’s organically creative intelligence, of which we are told, “The dream of the Earth, the pull of numinous gravity, draws us down toward ‘the heart of the world.’ By means of this communion, we can re-member ourselves, enabling us, when ripened, to ‘rise up rooted, like trees’.” </p>

<p>Of the inner-downward-evolutionary-re-connectivity of Inscendence, as praxis in the world and with the Earth, we have this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Inscendence practices… support the individual to cooperate with, to surrender to, the pull of the dream of the earth, also known as the call of the soul. This descent is experienced as a psycho-spiritual dying. We must die to our old ways of belonging to the world to enable us to uncover something radical, something new, something we could never have rationally deduced, something that our lives depend on.” </p>

<p>It is not possible to overemphasize the importance or urgency of this statement. As we look over the condition of the planet, who can deny the pressing of the issue, signs of a gathering storm, nearing horizon of an event of cataclysm, and the extremity of risk at which we are putting human existence and life itself? Even former skeptics in the scientific community are revising or reversing their prognosis due to accelerated environmental imbalance and changes. </p>

<p>Bill Plotkin also applies the defining of Inscendence to Thomas Berry’s reflections on the re-emergence of shaman and shamanism, that which in my own writings I have come to call green troubadour, eco-shaman and the eco-shamanic. Here then a further set of book quotations, beginning with Father Berry himself: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“More than any other of the human types concerned with the sacred, the shamanic personality journeys into the far reaches of the cosmic mystery and brings back the vision and the power needed by the human community at the most elemental level. The shamanic personality speaks and best understands the language of the various creatures of the Earth.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plotkin pursues these thoughts: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So far in this passage it seems that he (Berry) meant the realm of vision to be the domain or mission of the presumably rare individual in a society, the shamanic personality. But then in the very next sentence, ‘Not only is the shamanic type emerging in our society, but also the shamanic dimension of the psyche itself. In periods of significant cultural creativity, this aspect of the psyche takes on a pervasive role throughout the society’…” </p>
  
  <p>“Whether or not the healthy societies of the past were replete with mature members who experienced and embodied revelatory vision, I believe, along with Thomas, that this is both possible and necessary in this century if we are to successfully reinvent the human.” (Reinventing the human at the species level is a major component in Berry’s Ecozoic challenge.) “Sustainable societies, at this turning point in human and Earth’s evolution, will come about through neither human rationality nor the vision of a few individuals alone but through the pervasive emergence of ‘the shamanic dimension of the psyche’. Although the vision of the one can catalyze the many, the vision of each is needed to build the new cultures.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spontaneously I am inclined to shouting out an energetic, resounding (green) hallelujah of affirmation to the foregoing expression. Indeed, Bill Plotkin’s essay is superlative in a volume that is reader worthy and excellent from start to finish. Space does not allow me to do equal justice to the contributions from Joanna Macy, Duane Elgin, <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a>, Geneen Marie Haugen, Matthew Fox and the others. Rather, I must leave the now engaged reader with but scant few provocative quotations. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Berry: “Foundations of a new historical period, the Ecozoic Era, have been established… The mythic vision has been set into place… The dream drives the action. In the larger cultural context the dream becomes the myth that both guides and drives the action.”</p>
  
  <p>And: “The greatest single need for the survival of the Earth or of the human community in the twenty-first century is for an integral telling of the great story of the universe. This story must provide in our time what the mythic stories of earlier times provided as the guiding and energizing sources of the human venture… The three basic tendencies of the universe at all levels of reality are differentiation, spontaneous self-organization, and bonding. These tendencies identify the reality, the values, and the directions in which the universe is proceeding.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course for a portable—and tender, joyous—touchstone of Thomas Berry as pathfinder and fellow Earth-walker, one need go no further than to recall the most enchanting and memorable of his discoveries and reflections. In these five words—a comfortable fitting into a human palm—Father Berry’s ecosophy: <em>“We are the stones dancing”</em>.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><strong>Eric Snyder:</strong> What, in your view, are the most significant benchmarks/ successes in terms of educating the public about dreams in the past 30-40 years? </p>

<p><strong>Richard Wilkerson:</strong> In terms of dreamwork, the 1960s break-out into peer groups, the early books, the experimental dream groups, the networking newsletters and magazines like <em>Dream Network Journal</em>, the more formal ASD organization and conferences and finally the Internet. </p>

<p>The couch to culture break-out of the 1960s, where individuals began experimenting with the multiform encounter groups that were somewhat guided by the hope of liberation outside of traditional psychology and enlightenment outside of traditional spirituality, seems to me a big marker in the change of dream sharing. Before that time one had to embark on dreamwork quests within the confines of therapy, or to be invited into a rare esoteric spirituality group (Like A.R.E. dream research groups). </p>

<p>This evolution was fueled in the 1970s by researchers and their books. Writers like Patricia Garfield with <em>Creative Dreaming</em>, Ann Faraday with <em>Dream Power</em>, and <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed’s</a> <em>Sundance Community Dream Journal</em> synthesized the emerging ideas, techniques and experiments of the movement and put them into a media form (books and journals) accessible to the general public. </p>

<p>The 1980s might be called the Dream Movement Decade. The number of books on dreams and dreaming proliferated. The <em>Dream Network</em> brought dreamers ideas together from around the US and the world. The pioneers in dreaming got together and started the Association for the Study of Dreams, and dream groups could be found in all the US states and major cities. Lucid dreaming had moved from the category of the occult to science, and New Age spirituality reinforced the notion of the dreamer being the final authority on the meaning and value of their own inner experiences. Orthodox religious institutions that had persecuted people sharing dreams for centuries began to offer dream groups. The ASD <em>Dreaming</em> journal found its way into major educational libraries and international and regional conferences were held on a regular basis, bringing together anthropologists, scientists and researchers, clinical therapists, religious leaders, writers, and dream-inspired artists. </p>

<p>The 1990s saw the advent of the Internet and the ability for anyone who wanted to share dreams to quickly develop a group of peers from anywhere around the world and discuss their dreams. The number of people who are now interested in dreams has grown geometrically since the 1960s, and the educational outreach to interested individuals and groups has been greatly enhanced by the Internet and other networking organizations. The ability to network across the globe has advanced the feeling that dreams are a treasure crossing all national and religious boundaries. This has led to a sophistication in relation to dreams and dreaming that is unparalleled in history. There are many institutes, schools and organizations that study dreams in relation to science, anthropology, psychology, religion, the arts and humanities... and see dreams as a crucial part of these studies. </p>

<p><strong>Eric Snyder:</strong> How do you see the ‘Dream Movement’ at this time? </p>

<p><strong>Richard Wilkerson:</strong> Slowly spreading, interconnecting, very rhizomatic. The Dream Movement is difficult to capture as a whole at any one time and period. One of the defining characteristics of the movement has been the lack of defining characteristics. That is, dream folk tend to do a lot of their work on their own and this trend is manifested outwardly as well. Multiplicity of movement and plurality of progress follow along the polyvocity of ideas and polytheism of its spirit. A strong individualism pervades the dream movement culture. There are thousands of books, websites and groups, hundreds of organizations, and several schools with a dream focus, yet no real key texts, trends or manifestos as with other movements. One may at the same ASD conference find a presentation on benefits of dreamwork right along side a presentation about dreamwork being nonsense. One can find in a single issue of Electric Dreams e-zine an article by a postmodern philosopher on the random valuation in dreamwork alongside an article by a self-proclaimed guru on the dreams and enlightenment. This individualism is also the movement’s strength and a sign of the maturing tolerance and ability to hold together in one space many competing and opposing ideas. Some dream organizations, like ASD, do have ongoing mission statements but others, like BADG (Bay Area Dreamworkers Group), function more like interest groups online (i.e. they get together when there is an interest, and disband when there isn’t). </p>

<p>The movement is advancing most all of the original projects, and adding new ones which are beginning to delve into areas usually not considered as being the province of dreaming, such as politics. Dream activism groups use dreams to talk and discuss major collective issues of the day, and to plan activities that may take the future in the course or direction of the group values. Many dream groups since 9-11 have opened up the strictly dream-as-ego viewpoint and added the dream-as-worldself viewpoint. </p>

<p>While dreams are still a great mystery and science has barely opened the crack in the door between the dreaming brain and the dreaming mind, emerging research is offering new models of dreaming that haven’t been challenged since Aserinsky and Kleitman’s 1950s REM studies. These studies help dreamworkers to weigh and judge the various dreamwork theories. (Is the dream material all day residue, how much of the dream is influenced by physical forces, by psi forces, by psychological and spiritual forces and so on). </p>

<p><strong>Eric Snyder:</strong> What do you envision or suggest that we, as individuals and collectively, create in the next 40 years? We’re looking for blueprints and/or roadmaps into the future, here. </p>

<p><strong>Richard Wilkerson:</strong> Dreaming and dreamwork resist commodification, totalization and imprisonment. Dreaming and dreamwork promote liberation, play, health, and creativity. I expect this to be true for the next century as for the last. </p>

<p>What seems clear to me now is that dreamwork, dream studies, dream science, and dream-inspired works have proven themselves to be an important part of any project. This is true in two ways: the first in terms of wholeness and completion (no cognitive science is complete without an accounting of dreams, no spiritual or psychological work complete without dreamwork, and so on) but also as a friend and guide, inspiration and creative source. </p>

<p>In the short run, I see the dream movement providing continual support for individuals interested in dreams and that are ready or able to break out of the programming of everyday consensus reality. I feel this is happening at the level of therapists sensitive to dreams and educated in dreamwork as a practice of dissolving neurosis, as well as recreational dreamers who bring a sense of being and inherent meaning to the world of dreaming itself. This liberation is also made available by anthropologists who teach us about radically different approaches to dreamwork in other cultures. Our dream-concerned scientists remind us of the material forces that go into the many facets of dreaming. Our support of the development of peer and partnership paradigm grassroots dream groups, both online and off, will offer sanctuary and growth for those who want support in their journey. Our support of schools, publications and organizations that provide support for dreamers will, in the near future, make the pathway to dream awareness a less difficult and more networked, more diverse experience than in the past. </p>

<p>Looking further down the road, I would like to integrate into this speculation the notion brought up by Pierre Levy that “Humanization is virtualization.” In this view, the dream movement parallels a general trend that humankind has always been about building networks, moving ideas, integrating rich interconnections in rhizomatic fabrics of space and time. Dreamworkers are superb in these skills, and understand even at beginning levels of dreamwork how associations work. </p>

<p>In the first view of associations or connective syntheses, we can expect the Dream Movement to break into older patterns and flows of reality and make new connections; breaking up older organizations and connecting with people and their dreams in novel and productive ways. Using the older terminology, we might say that the future of the Dream Movement is about placing itself alongside as many other fields and practices as would be useful; dreams and health, dreams and creativity, dreams and business, dreams and spirit and so on. But this would just be a simple kind of expansion which the Movement is not likely to take, given its nature of subverting this type of expansionism and in its offering novel alternatives. </p>

<p>Rather, it's more likely that as the Dream Movement comes into contact with these organizations and regimes, they will change or metamorphosize in ways unexpected. Dream art, for example, will not just become a subcategory of types of art, but become aesthetico-political and/or polypsychotechnic movement that cuts between the lines of various traditional fields. </p>

<p>In the second view or level, where the Dream Movement in the future will provide new models for networking in virtual territory and disjunctive syntheses, we can expect some very novel transformations. Organic networks that are alliances of communicative communities — rather than hardwired circuits — will be distributed and connected by protocol rather than more restrictive bonds. The virtualization of the Dream Movement is not about its going online. In a few years the Internet will disappear. As Stephen Aizenstat mentioned at the 1999 ASD International Conference, soon the walls and floors will be alive and dreamworkers are positioned to help the world understand how to live this kind of virtual reality. That is, dreamworkers know how to move about in insubstantial material and create meaning and value. This is going to be vital as we move into living and working more and more in simulations, more and more in the hyperreal. </p>

<p>The Dream Movement has always been partially an exploration of virtual reality and its boundaries. This sensitivity to the bio-dramatic features of the virtual dreamworld will be needed in the future; first with computer-mediated virtual reality, and then with bio-logical and quantum fields of reality where the limits of what skin is and where our skin is will be stretched, where one senses friends around the globe, where presence and absence are measured in terms of emotional distances rather than miles. </p>

<p>In this sense, traditional dreamwork will be expanded to include not only the inner work and play of dreams of the individual for the individual, but then also carry outward what is learned and lived inwardly. The inner world of the dream has always been taken as a kind of communicative community; as we begin to live more in virtual space, we will see these skills transfer to the world itself. Is it not that the world will become dream or the dream the world. Rather, the skills and sensitivities of developing rapid rapport with other-ness and development of on-the-fly communicative communities — which prove to be so much of our inner dreamwork — will allow us to tend to the soul of the world in mutual embrace. ♦</p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Published in <strong>Ullman on Dreams</strong>, Vol. 19, No. 2, May 1975,  pp. 8-10, The American Academy of Psychoanalysis</em></p>

<p><em>Paper delivered at a Conference of Scientists with J. Krishnamurti at Brockwood Park, October 14, 1974.</em></p>

<p>I felt drawn to this theme as a consequence of three significant failures in my own life, which originally I thought were due to my own failings but were related to what I now think are the limitations of science, limitations that each of us in our own way are trying to talk about.</p>

<p>We start out in this world as more or less undifferentiated globs of protoplasm and our task appears to be to evolve into a human being having a place in a complex technological society. If we shift to a metaphorical mode we are up to our collective necks in deep water. To save ourselves from going under we reach out for support with only our right hand to grasp at what we think are a succession of solid structures. This is the master hand, the hand that enables us to master nature, to see the world as object and deal with the world objectively. This is the hand of science as science has come to be practiced. There is an awareness of the existence of a left hand and, on occasion, it flails about in the water. It is not seen as equal in strength and power to the right hand; rather it is seen in a somewhat negative light. It is labelled the "sinister" hand and is simply regarded as not being the right hand. Using only the right hand we do achieve a differentiated state, but one that never quite gets us out of the water, so that we continue to struggle atomistically against the forces tending to pull us under. Using both hands together in complementary fashion, however, would not only get us to that state of differentiation, but would also enable us to tackle the really important question of coming together on dry land in order to get on with the business of exploring and enjoying the universe. End of metaphor.</p>

<p>The use of both hands in getting us out of the water can still be called science, I suppose, but it would be quite a bit different from the science we now know. It would move from its preoccupation with nature as object to be mastered to a concern with what it is that has been mastered; and conversely, what it is that has been omitted, i.e., the sensuous aspects of man and nature and the price paid for this one-sidedness in human terms.</p>

<p>There have been various ways of noting this duality apart from the right brain, left brain dichotomy implied in the metaphor - the way of science vs. the way of mysticism, the categorizing vs. the contextual mode of information processing. Others speak of objective knowledge vs. sensuous knowledge, or the active mode vs. the receptive mode. The terminology I find most congenial is borrowed from the formulations of Andras Angyal, a psychiatrist who should be better known than he is. Angyal characterized the two essential trends in the human organism as the striving for autonomy, i.e., the self-organizing, self-enhancing, self-determining tendencies, and the striving for harmony, by which he meant the need to relate to and feel a part of a larger whole. The methods of objective science appear to have evolved in connection with the former, whereas our capacity for love and our aesthetic expression seem more related to the latter. My point is that science has paid too little attention to man's homonomous needs and there are too few psychoanalysts around to pick up the pieces.</p>

<p>The three areas of failure I referred to earlier are areas where the scientific method should presumably work, but where in my experience it falls somewhat short of the mark. In each instance my feeling is that the failure is traceable not to the flaws of the scientific method, but to the lack of an effective complementary approach.</p>

<p>Failure number one is the general field of psychiatry. I am a psychiatrist by profession. A significant transformation occurred in my life when I allowed myself the realization that psychiatry was not a part-time affair, that its practice was more of an art than a science and, as such, it demanded a total commitment and that the level at which one pursued it could not be divorced from the life style of its practitioners. I will not go into the evidence in support of this except to call your attention to several beginning trends in this direction, i.e., Laing's effort to provide a total environment at Kingsley Hall, Jones in his evolution of the therapeutic community at Dingleton Hospital and now, in the States among the young, a movement known as radical therapy.</p>

<p>Failure number two has to do with the longest, unsuccessful courtship in history - the near century old effort on the part of a handful of serious scientists and scholars of all kinds, interested in psychic phenomena, to woo the interest and acceptance of the scientific establishment so that the romance could be legitimized and ultimately consummated. While still in college I discovered that men like William Crookes, William James, Charles Richet, Oliver Lodge and Henri Bergson, to name a few, took a serious interest in what was then called psychical research. At that same time, add the fact that in the course of experimenting over a period of two years with some fellow students I came upon what I felt were rather remarkable and genuine paranormal phenomena, and you have what, for a young person, were the makings of a terrible dilemma. The result, of course, was that I felt impelled to build a special psychic closet in which to house this particular skeleton. Only in recent years, in response to a changing scientific ambience, have I gently opened the door. Someday it may be possible to transform the skeleton to a fullbodied creature, able to walk out of the closet by himself.</p>

<p>The final failure was linked to, perhaps, the most profound transformation of my professional life. It was my realization that Freud's theory of dreams was wrong. Lest this sound both immodest and disrespectful, let me hasten to add that his was a magnificent theory, richly presented, and it did call attention to the therapeutically useful features of dreams. Freud, in my opinion, in his determination to build a scientific psychology, approached dreams through the wrong mode. It was like trying to pick up a mixture of water and solids with a sieve. Much is lost in the process. Unfortunately, the very magnificence of Freud's work cast a long, paralyzing shadow on the subject for well over fifty years, although Jung and others did sense a little of the nature of the essence that was escaping Freud's container. Without going into details of an alternate theory of dreaming, let me emphasize that I regard dreams as creative and aesthetic experiences that depict in the form of visual metaphors the present state of our connections and disconnections with the world about us.</p>

<p>For some time I had been toying with the idea that what we experienced as a dream had an antecedent history in an event that was beyond time and space ordering, and came upon us in something approaching an instantaneous happening at critical moments in the transformation of one form of consciousness to another. The onset of the dreaming phase is one such critical modal point. The black dot at the left in the accompanying figure represents this event. It may be regarded as a kind of black hole of the psyche containing an enormously condensed information mass. Since this falls completely outside the realm of our ordinary information processing capacities, it is experienced as ineffable. We are forced to let it expand, as it were, or unfold and then deal with it in bits and pieces, ordered as best we can in time and space. These are the visual images that make up the dream as depicted by the various shapes in the figure. The information is still highly condensed, less so than formerly, and is spread out before us. A second transformation occurs when we reach the waking state. Here we try to transform this private experience into a public mode. This requires a further unfolding of the information contained in the images and the translation of this information into a public medium of exchange, namely language. Here is where we get into trouble because the information goes beyond what can be conveyed in a discursive mode. Much of the information is more readily felt than described. Moreover, the engagement with the information at a feeling level is an experiment in growth. That black hole contains within it our personal expanding universe and we do both ourselves and the universe an injustice when we try to reduce it to a play of instincts. Comments by David Bohm have both provided me with a language fitting to this process, namely, the successive transformation of implicate into explicate, as well as the more important sense of support from another domain, the world of physics, for what is simply an intuitive surmise on my part. What is implicate at one stage becomes explicate in the next stage through a process of unfolding, and what is explicate at this stage becomes implicate for the next stage.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zftran-0.jpg" alt="Implicate to explicate diagram" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If we use dreams simply as illustrative of a broader range of phenomena, unattended to or inadequately attended to by the present focus of scientific inquiry, then four general features of these phenomena emerge:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are more readily appreciated than interpreted. Psychiatrists should have courses in dream appreciation rather than dream interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>They share with all aesthetic experiences the quality of transcending space and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Their specific domain is the connective tissue between people, the underlying matrix of human existence, the sense of contact or contactlessness between people.</p></li>
<li><p>They are all in one way or another the creative embodiment of unpremeditated responses to novelty. Dreams provide us with perhaps our most familiar experience with this in the way our dreams capture appropriate, socially derived images to express subjective events.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What is the agency that provides this unending source of unerringly apt visual metaphors? I don't think we honestly know the answer to this question, but I do know how easy it is to gloss over our ignorance by attributing the whole works to some reified, internal demon, variously known as Primary Process, our Unconscious, or simply, our Id. Perhaps a prior question would be, what is the nature of the process involved in the selection and organization of the visual images with which we build the content of our dream consciousness? If we look at the process simply, i.e., without an allegiance to deeply embedded theoretical biases, we seem to be involved in a rather intriguing process. We seem to be able to bring together a selected array of bits and pieces of past social data that have become known to us over the course of our personal life history, and then to rearrange the data in a spatial and temporal ordering, bearing no relationship to their original time-space frame of reference, but one which enables them, through the personal transformation we have wrought, to rather precisely, dramatically and effectively express the particular interplay of feelings mobilized by a current unresolved life situation. Social reality makes a significant contribution to our dreams. It provides us with the very special kinds of building blocks it takes to capture and express one or another aspect of our subjective life. When you stop to think about it, it takes a rather high level of creative and organizational ability to tap our own internal computer for the appropriate bits with which to solve the puzzle and then to rearrange them in a way that makes sense as a kind of emotional template, highlighting a problematic aspect of our immediate experience. Having gone this far, we are almost forced to admit that the powers displayed by our dreaming selves far exceed the scope of our waking faculties. The comparison is, of course, unfair, since each is supreme in its own domain. One is not better than the other; each is a powerful way of grasping different aspects of our existence. Our problem is that we have paid more attention to the one than to the other. This view of our dream suggests that we are capable of looking quite deeply into the face of reality and of seeing mirrored in that face the most subtle and poignant features of our constant struggle to transcend our own personal, limited, self-contained, autonomous self so as to better be able to connect with and be part of a larger unity. Just as someone once remarked, our eyes may be regarded as the means nature created in order to see itself, in the same way our dreams may be viewed as an instrument created by society to see itself and its distortions reflected in one of its own creations. We cannot understand the level and range of creativity displayed in this manner as having its source in the individual alone. It has to be understood as a function of the individual and society. The dream comes about because, in the interest of reaching out toward this sense of unity, each of us has turned our psyche to an exquisitely sensitive pitch with a capacity to store and use what we have seen, heard and learned intuitively of the world about us, and function as a vehicle for expressing everything from passion to prejudice. The world endlessly nourishes and replenishes these creative juices, although for some of us they come out only at night, and for all of us they are far more discerningly honest at night.</p>

<p>The homonomous approach to knowledge, if identified and worked with, provides the self with enormously powerful tools with which to effect change and transformation. Any system, including a given personality system, becomes more than it conceives itself to be when, in fact, it is shown to be more on the exposure and identification of these connecting channels to a larger reality.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>In the process of living, I often incubate a dream to get information. So, in keeping with the current Dream Network theme, I turned to dream incubation to give me additional understanding about the experience of living one's life as if it were a dream. </p>

<p>My incubated dreams are often quite understandable so I was expecting to get some quick and easy to understand information. Instead, I got a middle-of-the-night dream about a family that had been getting light over a period of years. The meaning of light as well as other dream elements, however, all lacked clarity. The dream itself seemed to be more like the waking process of ‘brainstorming’ often used to generate ideas. </p>

<p>After jotting down the dream, I had to use the bathroom. Without turning on any lights, I walked into the bathroom and saw a star through the window, beautifully framed by an opening in the surrounding tree branches. I realized that the light of the star could in some way be a continuation of the focus on light in my dream. As I turned from the window, my attention was caught by a lighted wall switch. The thought occurred to me that seeing lights could be the beginning of a waking nightmare experience if I allowed it to be. That realization triggered more thoughts of lights before I was able to bring the train of thought to a close. </p>

<p>I began walking back to the bedroom without switching on any lights that might disturb the sleep cycle. Even so, my eye caught the lighted switch in the hallway. Then, upon entering the bedroom, the lighted switch on the electric heater caught my attention. The realization came that if I didn’t jot down the unusual waking experience of noticing/seeing these lights, the recall might drift away in dream like fashion. So, I groped for my flashlight, and realized that I was faced with still another light. </p>

<p>Possibly the awareness of the parade of lights in my nighttime waking moments had been initiated by the dream theme of collecting light. The experience was not particularly pleasant. To eliminate the unpleasantness, I considered the more comforting thought that when we see “the light,” we’ve gotten the answer. Conflicting with that idea was a bunch of nighttime scribbles in my dream journal that contained no simple answer about waking as a dream. As the disappointment became clear, I heard a still small voice say, “Wonderful.” At hearing the voice, my resulting excitement blocked out whatever was supposed to be so wonderful. </p>

<p>So, I turned off my flashlight to go back to sleep. As I did so, I saw the glow from the digital display of my clock that I had carefully covered so I wouldn't see the light. Agh, more light. I figured that there must be a message here somehow about seeing the light. Next, I realized that I’d forgotten to put in my mouthpiece to avoid nighttime teeth grinding. So, I got up again and had difficulty finding it because the night-time glow built into its container had gone out. </p>

<p>The experience with light was becoming more complicated and difficult to understand. With relief, an idea came to mind from Ralph Blum’s The Book of Runes. He writes of the desire to immerse oneself in the experience of living “without having to evaluate or understand.” With that in mind, I could go back to sleep. </p>

<p>The next day, an old choir friend gave me a call. During the course of our conversation, I told her about my recent dream along with my intention to learn more about experiencing waking life as if it were a dream. She didn't seem to resonate with the topic. Instead, she said, “Well Arthur, you know the first thing God said was ‘Let there be light.’” She then proceeded to sing a song as a prayer for me that finished with “May God’s light shine on your face.” She brought our conversation to a close by repeating the last line of the song. </p>

<p>Later, as I sat back and contemplated the call, I realized that not only was the focus on light continuing in my life, but also that I’d been given a heart-felt gift. That gift of a blessing was related to immersing myself in and being conscious of my waking and dreaming experiences. My dream incubation process that had been designed to more fully understand waking as if one is in a dream certainly yielded unexpected results. The results were reminders of a number of factors including: the powerful effect of intention on our dreams and waking; the back-and-forth flow of information and emotions between dreams and waking; how the mystery of light is alive and well; the question about which comes first, the dream or the waking and finally, the un-predictability of life, the energy drain that can occur when trying to understand things, and the fact that there just aren’t any simple answers. Possibly most important, however, was the reminder that by immersing ourselves in life—and ‘The Light,’ we can experience satisfaction and a fullness that no amount of understanding can bring. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Whenever I am getting ready for a radio interview or a talk, I try to anticipate the questions. I usually get questions like … How can I remember my dreams? Do dreams answer questions? Do they foretell the future? What does the dream I had last night “mean?” </p>

<p>But on this particular talk show, I was thrown off a bit. The kind lady on the phone handed me a really simple, basic question. But it caused me to hesitate. To think a bit. </p>

<p>Her question: <strong>What is a dream?</strong></p>

<p>I thought back. Had any of the so called dream “experts” answered that question? I have noticed that most writers of dream books dive right in, assuming everyone knows what they are talking about when they discuss dreams. </p>

<p>The question is definitely worthy of a thoughtful answer. So here is my take on it. My response draws on my understanding of ancient wisdom and eastern philosophy. Our personalities have three aspects: the physical, the emotional, and the mental. The brain is part of the physical aspect. When we die, the physical aspect ceases to exist, but for some time we continue to experience emotion and retain our mental capabilities. </p>

<p>When we dream, we are experiencing a state of consciousness similar to death. Our physical senses are shut down, but our emotional and mental aspects are running full steam. Dream researchers tell us the brain is still functioning during dream periods. The motor and emotional areas of the brain are highly active, enabling us to actually “experience” the dream. But I think the dream is less a function of the physical brain than it is of the mind, an aspect of ourselves that transcends the physical. </p>

<p>In the dream state we are free from the distractions of waking life. Free from our day-to-day concerns. I compare it to the Hubble telescope. Scientists knew that to fully experience the universe they had to free themselves from the bounds of earthly atmospheric distractions. In the dream state you can experience whatever happens to you without thought of prejudice, of what it will cost, of who is watching you, of what will happen if you fail. Here your mind receives objective information. Even better, in the dream state you are connected to universal consciousness. You are able to see all the universe has to offer. Your dream is what you see in your Hubble telescope. </p>

<p><strong>What <em>is</em> a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information. A dream is what you would be thinking about if you weren’t so busy working, or buying things, or paying bills, or worrying, or seeking pleasure. </p>

<p>As you sleep, at the end of a day of working, buying things, paying bills, worrying, seeking pleasure, whatever … your mind processes these events and all the emotions associated with them. It considers them in relation to all that you are and all that you could be. Your mind selects a theme—an essential issue, idea, or perception— that your need brought to your consciousness at this point in your life. Your mind then attempts to present this theme in a form you can understand. </p>

<p>Most of us are accustomed to the narrative, storybook form. So, for most of us, the mind attempts to tell us a story. This story presents the issues you need to deal with in your waking life. These issues are normally things you know about but are avoiding or afraid to face. They may be things of which you are not yet conscious. </p>

<p>Of course, not everyone processes things in this narrative sense. For instance, artists may just experience visual images, with no storyline at all. </p>

<p>We are told that Billy Joel and Sting are given their musical inspiration in the dream state. I know a potter in Virginia who first “sees” her new projects in dreams. Artists, scientists, and other visionaries often experience ideas, perceptions, and new perspectives in their dreams. </p>

<p>At the point of waking from your dream, you have choices about what to do with your new-found objective information. You can ignore it and say, “It was just a dream.” Or you can act on this profound message that has come to move you forward, to take you to a new level of understanding about yourself and your world, to give you new insight into your skills and abilities and what you can produce. Someone said, “We cannot discover new oceans unless we have the courage to lose sight of the shore.” Dreams are asking you to be brave, to take a step forward into new adventures. They are asking you to explore the mystery. </p>

<p>True, they are normally filled with complicated symbolism. True, they are normally asking us to consider some degree of change in our lives. These concerns do not have to stop you in your tracks. I believe the quickest and best way to get past these hurdles is to seek out the core messages—the themes—our dreams are asking us to explore. </p>

<p>Consider a recent dream you have had. Ask yourself, what is the theme of this dream? Generally, did it deal with how you differentiate yourself from others, or how you express yourself, or how you interact with others, or how you capitalize on your experience? Think in terms of broad issues. For example, in the dream, did you experience need, vulnerability, success, failure, exploration, new discovery, adaptability, sharing, love, desire? Were you threatened or criticized? Did you have trouble communicating or applying your knowledge and skills? Did you feel out of control or restricted in some way? Were you surprised to learn there was some new world to explore or some new direction your work can take? </p>

<p>These are all common themes in dreams. But your specific dream is not “common.” It deals with you and your life. Ask yourself where in your waking life you are experiencing these issues or feelings or activities. Finally, look back at the details of the dream to see if it contains new information or clues about how to deal with waking life issues or how to develop and present new ideas or perceptions.</p>

<p><strong>What is a dream?</strong> A dream is objective information from deep within you and from the universe around you. It is coming to help you grow. To find your role in the world. To be the best you can be. To be free and to be whole. Honor it by acting on the specific message it is asking you to address. </p>

<p>For more information on themes and how to work with them in your daily dream work, I provide general information on my website, <a href="www.heartofthedream.com">www.heartofthedream.com</a>, and more detailed information in my book, Dream Exploration: A New Approach. ℘</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Weaving Dreams into the Classroom Practical Ideas for Teaching about Dreams and Dreaming at Every Grade Level, including Adult Education by Curtiss Hoffman &amp; Jacquie Lewis (editors), <a href="http://www.brownwalker.com/book/1612337260">Brown Walker</a>, Inc, 2014, 184 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><em>Weaving Dreams into the Classroom</em> was conceived during a symposium presented at the 27th annual Conference of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) in 2010, where the theme of Dreams in Educational Environments was heavily emphasized and supported. </p>

<p>The book is a compilation of chapters from 10 educators who provide practical, hands-on models for bringing dream education to students of all ages. It is organized by level of instruction, beginning with elementary and secondary education and continuing to cover undergraduate, graduate and adult education. Importantly, since many dream educators encounter difficulty in gaining approval for integrating dreams into their curriculum, the authors provide creative solutions for overcoming potential objections. </p>

<p>Each chapter offers a diversity of approaches and perspectives from the different authors and there are numerous examples of how educators organize their classes and incorporate various methodologies and dreamwork projects into their courses. </p>

<p>Also discussed are: types of dreams at people have at different ages; samples of students’ dreams; how to orchestrate dream groups; the creative influence of dreams as a source of inspiration and imagination; the generative and transformative power of dreams, and the long-term effect dreamwork has had on students from their own point of view. Students also share examples of how they are taking what they learned out into the world. </p>

<p>One special chapter is written by a man who was the youngest presenter in the history at the IASD Conference where he premiered his film The Dream Mystery: An American Teen’s Search for Dream Elders; he has worked with his dreams since childhood, explored the ways in which various cultures place value on their dreams; he shared how dream appreciation has influenced his life. Common throughout the book are examples of the tremendous benefits students have acquired by studying dreams, such as increased intuition, self understanding, self-esteem, compassion and overall well being. </p>

<p>One thing is clearly evident: students’ lives are enhanced by dreamsharing and dreamwork; the more opportunities they are given to learn about how to work with their dreams, the stronger the possibility of affecting positive and conscious-centered change in regards to themselves, their families and communities, as well as the planet. </p>

<p>Outside the classroom, the authors examine the decline of dreamwork training in clinical psychology, questioning why dreams are no longer a significant component of study—especially given the fact that working with dreams constituted the very foundation of that field. Examples of how and why graduate students feel ill equipped to do dreamwork with clients are detailed, along with suggestions for overcoming this handicap. </p>

<p>Students are our future. As Weaving Dreams into the Classroom clearly conveys, young people are the ones who will determine the choices, decisions and actions of generations to come. Providing classes that teach about the wisdom and value of dreams and how to work with them provides a powerful foundation for self-knowledge and healing on all levels: individually, collectively, ecologically and globally. </p>

<p><em>Weaving Dreams into the Classroom</em> is a unique book and comes at a crucial point in human history. We are on the verge of destroying our planet and must seek another way to proceed into the future if we are to create and sustain quality of life for all sentient beings. In this regard, it is vital that we, as a species, learn to connect with and honor our dreams. Whether you are an educator or simply a person who is passionate about sharing the value of dreams with others, this is an essential resource to add to your personal library.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Dear Dream Network Journal Readers,</p>

<p>It was an unremarkable and doubtless chilly midweek winter evening in January 2019 when our regular <a href="https://eastwest.works/Intui.html#content4-2p">Dream Share</a> met in midtown E of Manhattan just a block away from the United Nations, and a kangaroo from abroad who was studying computer science in Philadelphia hopped in. A few hours of later we sent him packing with a random edition of the Dream Network Journal pulled off the shelf, and made due diligence in a requisite email follow up. </p>

<p>This person was <a href="../@dan">Daniel Kennedy</a>. He continued to make the trek to and fro, and to delve into our dreaming nature, and our project came to resolve. A little over two years have transpired since the idea inception, and subsequent <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/dream-network-journal">campaign</a> launch to collect a full set of the print published DNJ, digitize it and donate the collection to a publicly accessible library. Our numerous donors can be referenced at the campaign site, and The NY Public library <a href="https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14090419">now holds a complete hard copy collection</a> in its periodicals division.</p>

<div class="caption"><span>The entire Dream Network Journal collection in the periodical room at New York Public Library</span></div>

<p><a href="../@robertaossana">Roberta Ossana</a> and I first came into contact years ago after I was introduced to the DNJ by a long running dream group that met on E 57 hosted by Leon van Leeuwen. As a creative type I’d had an interest in and sensed the value of dreaming phenomena; yet until that time I’d never participated in dream sharing as an art and form of self cultivation. I subscribed to our publication and along the way ensured the dreamwork group I inherited from Leon got listed in DNJ’s resource backpage.</p>

<p>From Utah, New South Wales and New York; Roberta, Dan and I respectively aligned our nisus to form an El Sueño, a kind of dream current that fulfilled the preservation objectives. In the past several months Dan has humbly and successfully built, and recently launched the new DNJ website, and begun working with authors on soon to be released articles. Currently, another solid sequence of this amazing dream cherishing archive and resource are on their way to the land known for its dream walkers, Australia; and its <a href="https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/">State Library of Victoria</a>. </p>

<p>Somehow even a global plague hasn’t stopped this dream from manifesting. I envision a post pandemic world as one that is more dream sharing, responsive, and remembering. Who knows what dreams will emerge next? Let’s ready the sails of our hearts and those to come to welcome, and catch the gales and breezes upon the ocean of dreaming.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div class="caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Inception</i>, 2010, directed by Christopher Nolan</div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>I am certain many viewers walked out of Inception with great delight at the concept. Its creative expression is brilliant. However, as someone who has been teaching Extraordinary Dreams such as lucid dreaming, dreams within dreams, mutual dreaming, for a very long time, I left the movie with some questions. </p>

<p>Although the movie draws attention to extraordinary experiences in dreams, I wonder about the message this film is conveying. Of course the movie is Science Fiction, but beyond every novel or any science fiction, there is scientific and narrative truth. In a recent interview, Chris Nolan stated that he did not do much research into dreaming and that the script is based primarily on his own experiences. His personal experience has provided him with enough qualitative material to convey states of consciousness that some people access easily while others manage to attain only through effort, incubation or invocation. </p>

<p>Whether the knowledge is gained from within or outside, the incorporation of his personal experience with dreams and literature in the movie is brilliant and the visuals are stunning... although the thriller content of chasing and killing were far from being original or interesting. Haven’t we all had those “recurring dreams”? Can we be thrilled with something else? </p>

<p>Maybe I am numbed by the state of the world conflict, but somehow taking a subject so incredible and inoculating it with another chasing theme is not an exciting dream-movie to me. Yes, the incorporation was fabulous... but such nightmares are no longer subconscious material. I was hoping that as the characters went (as they called it) “deeper,” that their subconscious would illuminate something different than that with which we are already surrounded. Perhaps there could have been a profound solution of how to go beyond our psychic warfare? Violence is no longer deep in the subconscious. Violence is what we deal with on a daily basis. We should not forget that at this moment violence is in our backyard, it is not in someone else's. It is not in the world of imagination, it is here. We just have to tune into world news on a daily basis. </p>

<p>The thrill for me as an audience was the anticipation of waiting to see if they could arrive at a place within consciousness where the seed of wisdom lies, beyond the reptilian brain of fight or flight. I suppose that was my dream: that they would reach a transformative state that not only elevated the characters to greater lucidity but also awakened the audience to new levels of consciousness. </p>

<p>In the movie, the last level they reached within the main character’s subconscious, was powerful psychological work and offered the kind of choice-making that lucid dreaming practices have been promoting for years. There was hope that we’d see emotional resolutions. Rather, the movie illustrated that such practices can cause delusions and thus the danger of not being able to distinguish the dream state from reality. This is a clear example of how great phenomena such as lucid dreaming can be taken out of context. </p>

<p>What I appreciated about the movie was the incredible creativity in visual animations, clever plot of dreams within dreams, perceptual play and the fact that, as an audience, we were captured in the layers of the repetitive dream within dreams to the extent of forgetting where the line is: the distinction between waking and dream reality? </p>

<p>The main actor (DiCaprio) performed beautifully, as do many of our dream characters. We are often caught in those dreams and we believe in them. The actress (Ellen Page) was truly the lucid one who practiced non-attachment to the emotional illusions and made the choices that kept the nightmare from turning into further tragedy. </p>

<p>Of course all of us in the field of dream studies will likely watch this movie over and over again. It provides a great topic for discussion about dreams, extraordinary experiences in dreams and waking reality. But I ask again, can we not create a larger vision, using higher states of consciousness to move beyond conflict, greed and violence? Perhaps as humans, we have no example of “what it is like” to be and live in such a state of consciousness. Is that why we keep repeating our old dreams? </p>

<p>Since Nolan is deeply interested in dreams, I hope, in his next film, that he continues to face the psychological shadow and move even deeper into the spaces of the Soul/Mind where he can allow the natural wisdom phenomena to reveal itself. Perhaps then we will see not only the resolution of the inner conflicts but the display of a workable solution for a world desperately in need of harmony. ∞</p>

<p>A good understanding of our dreams will lead us to a better understanding of ourselves. Recently a group of friends and I got together in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and started a dream group. The group is based on sharing out recent dreams and trying to help each other to better understand the meanings of the dreams. The goal of the group is to be more aware of ourselves through our dreams and to advance in self-realization. </p>

<p>A long time ago, I began to work with my dreams by setting my alarm clock to awaken me in the night at a time when, according to to the information about the REM cycle, I might be most likely to remember a dream. I had pen and notebook ready at hand for recording. Just about every time I awakened with the clock, I would write down some clues which would help me recall my dreams in the morning and record them in more detail. </p>

<p>Now I am habituated to remembering my dreams and I can tell when I am going into the waking state. I know that I can spend up to 10 minutes in this state, so I now rehearse the dreams in my memory, and fix the images in my mind. After waking up, I usually spend perhaps half an hour in bed thinking about the night of sleep and and dreams. The dreams that I first noted down in the middle of the night, I fill in with more detail as I write all the dreams I have been able recall. Working with the dreams begins right away as I write them down and think about them. Working with my dreams, remembering them and writing them down I have discovered that I have had precognitive dreams, lucid dreams, and dreams that led to the feeling of <em>deja vu</em> when awake. </p>

<p>Sometimes I make a sketch of a particularly important dream image. It is very helpful to sketch a dream right after waking - I try to capture the colors with colored pencils. Some dreams are so moving that just recording them in a journal is not enough - so I write them as poems. Sharing dreams with a close friend usually gives me some different perceptions of my dreams and of myself. It is almost like therapy, because a close friend is aware of my personal life and can often give me some insights. Working through my dreams makes me realize more about myself. This understanding has led me to some unexpected insights into my life!</p>

    ns1:description """<p>"Freud is right," I said to myself, somewhat incredulous as the psychology professor explained the id and the libido. "Freud is right," I said again and shook my head. It was 1980 and I was a psychology major at Drake University listening to a lecture on Freud's theory of the id, ego, superego and the libido. The instructor had outlined Freud's theory that the id-or the vast unconscious within one's psyche-was the source of the libido, the sexually based instinctual energy that fueled much of motivation and behavior. </p>

<p>At that moment, I felt Freud had illuminated an interesting aspect of my lucid dreaming-that the feeling of extraordinary energy when conscious in the dream. I reasoned that-if the dream state was located in the id or unconscious-then, when lucid, one was exploring the unconscious with one's conscious awareness. Freud's theory would seemingly predict that a dreaming person, in their id or unconscious, would definitely experience the libido energy. I thought back to my first five years of lucid dreaming experiences and recalled the incredible surge of energy that occurs when lucid-that deep, intense, sometimes ecstatic, often sexual, energy streaming through my awareness. I could only conclude that Freud might be on to something. </p>

<p>But what were others experiencing in their lucid dreams? Was this ecstatic energy common in lucid dreams? Or was it just me, a 20 year old junior in college with possible raging hormones and a penchant for lucid dreaming? </p>

<p>"Orgasm is a natural part of lucid dreaming," proclaimed Dr. Patricia Garfield in her fascinating book <em>Pathway to Ecstasy: The Way of the Dream Mandala</em>, first published in 1979. Drawing upon many of her lucid dream experiences with bold frankness and a penetrating eye for detail, she went on to write, "in fully two thirds of my lucid dreams, I feel the flow of sexual energy; this arousal culminates in an orgasmic burst on about half of those occasions." </p>

<p>Garfield's book unabashedly acknowledged a common denominator in lucid dreaming; namely that the shift from dreaming to conscious or lucid dreaming was normally accompanied by a special, energetic, inner feeling which often was ultimately directed by the dreamer to sexual expression. Lucid dreamers would often write, "I know I am dreaming. I want to have fun. Feeling amorous, I look down an empty street and desire a man. Suddenly I see a man ...."</p>

<p>What else might explain this desire for sexual expression? In lucid dreams, the senses are often very acute and vivid. Touching often seems hypersensitive. Coupled with a feeling of energy and freedom, this tactile intensity may encourage further sensuousness or sex. Also in lucid dreams, one is aware of safety, ensconced in a creation of ones own making. Directing the action to pleasurable activities is easily achieved and often free from waking or moralistic concerns. One lucid dreamer's fantasy: "I realized I was dreaming and stepped into the school room. I saw there were a few women there. Feeling amorous, I decided to announce that I wanted to see more attractive women when I re-entered the room. I stepped out into the hallway, shut the door and waited. I reopened the door with a definite feeling of expectation. A line of attractive nude women stood looking back at me. It was amazing!" </p>

<p>Of course in many lucid dreams, there is no overt or apparent covert sexual action or imagery or only a part may be directed to sexual expression. The majority of the lucid dream may be directed to exploring the lucid dream state: flying, transforming dream object or events, talking to dream characters, or predetermined goals of the lucid dreamer. </p>

<p>Experienced lucid dreamers learn to contravene the sexual component for two basic reasons. They learn that excessive emotions can terminate a lucid dream. Therefore intense sexual feelings may cause lucidity to end, much like overloading -a circuit breaker. An example illustrates this: "I pulled her close and could feel her breasts as I reached under her sweater. But then the emotional intensity was building and I could tell that the lucid dream was about to end."</p>

<p>Second, a lucid dreamer may have a particular goal in mind, actively choosing to ignore a sexual situation. One lucid dreamer wrote, "I brush against one of the women as I stand up, then I realize that this is a lucid dream! I look at my hands for a moment to stabilize things. As I look up again, one of the women is now wearing only underwear. I ignore her because I have a desire to experiment. I see the wall in front of me with old wallpaper and decide to walk through it and experience that as I do so, I have a funny perception, kind of a half second of 'brown vision,' which I assume is my visualization of the wall internally."</p>

<h2>Flying, Sex and Ecstasy</h2>

<p>Most experienced lucid dreamers agree that some degree of sexual activity occurs in many lucid dreams. An informal survey found that their favorite activity when lucid was flying; sexual expression was their second.</p>

<p>Freud drew a linkage to flying as a dream symbol for sexual expression in his book The Interpretation of Dreams. Reflecting upon childhood 'romping' and the giddy excitement of being swung about by adults, Freud concluded, "Not infrequently in these motion games, innocuous in themselves, sexual feelings will be aroused". Is there a connection between flying and sex in lucid dreams? It may be an association with ecstasy- "a state of exalted delight in which normal understanding is felt to be surpassed" -or from the Greek, ek-stasis, "to displace, drive out one's senses". Lucid dreams are in some sense ecstatic; they jar us out of "stasis' or standstill. They shift our consciousness. They force us into a new awareness that provides the energy to express freedom, intensity and joy in a symbolic way, such as flying, sexual union or transcendental experiences. </p>

<p>I found that Patricia Garfield reached a similar conclusion, "...we are stimulating an area of the brain or a chain of responses that is associated with ecstatic states of all sorts. Sensations of flying, sexual heights, acute pleasurable awareness, and a sense of oneness are all natural outcomes of a prolonged lucid dream." This sense of ecstasy may generalize to a number of diverse but highly pleasurable dream behaviors or actions, linked through inner associational processes. </p>

<h2>Symbolism in Lucid Dreams</h2>

<p>Although the lucid dreamer's sexual activities are normally consciously directed by their conscious intent, other parts of the dream (the setting, the atmosphere, the action of the dream characters) are not typically consciously directed but simply accepted by the lucid dreamer. This suggests that the symbolic function of a dream continues in the background, while accommodating the consciously directed activities of the lucid dreamer. This lucid dreamers' account may express this:</p>

<p><em>I am wearing a long, red slip dress over a white top ... and marveling at such a wonderful dream scene. I still want sex. I go through the house looking for someone. I even go down to the basement... I see a light coming from the furnace area.</em></p>

<p>The red dress may symbolically express, fashion-wise, this lucid dreamer's sexual urge, though it wasn't consciously chosen. Similarly, the light coming from the furnace area may suggest the dreamer's heat, fire, or passion. The dream continues:</p>

<p><em>I look out the front door and see R ... I know it is a dream version of R so it's okay to have sex with him ... I tell him let's go down there, as I point to the brook area and the tall reeds ... I lay floating supported by the reeds ... I hope Dad can't see me out the window ... I remind myself that I'm dreaming and it doesn't matter who sees. R may not even be there anymore but I experience an orgasm anyway.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zlucse-0.jpg" alt="Lucid couple among the reeds" width="400px"/></p>

<p>The setting of tall reeds and brook may symbolically reflect the sexual action.</p>

<p>In many lucid dream accounts, one reads of the dreamer wrestling with where to have their sexual activity: in the open, in the closet, with no one present, with many others present, etc., all of which may have symbolic significance. One lucid dreamer felt his experience shed 'light' on his inner feelings:</p>

<p><em>I was lucid, and seemed to be in an attic with Jots of boxes and chests around. For some reason the lighting was very dim, and shadowy. I saw a woman there, and knowing this was a dream, decided to have sex with her. In the next moment. her clothing was gone and she was looking towards me as she sat on the floor with her legs open. As I moved closer. I may have been thinking about the darkness for a second and then the oddest thing happened, a shaft of light from above shone down directly upon her vaginal It was like a theatrical stage light had suddenly turned on. Boom! It totally lit up with a brilliant white light! I laughed with delight.</em></p>

<p>The dreamer felt the scene in the attic may have reflected his thinking about issues of sex and spirituality.</p>

<h2>Lucidity, Sex and Physiology</h2>

<p>Garfield also hints that there may possibly be a physiological component in lucid dreaming and sex. Later, research reported by Dr. Stephen LaBerge in his book Lucid Dreaming, states that "lucid dreaming occurs during a highly activated phase of REM sleep, associated, as a result, with increased vaginal blood flow or penile erections." While this is an interesting point, one can only wonder if the physiological event is being driven by the dream cognitions or if the dream cognitions are an artifact of physiological activities. </p>

<p>In a separate 1983 sleep laboratory study, LaBerge asked a female lucid dreamer to signal through rapid eye-movements that she was lucid dreaming, and then signal when she was nearing orgasm in the lucid dream. The physiological measures of heightened respiration, and vaginal muscle activity and pulse amplitude matched her lucid dream signaling. This indicated that the sexual dream content was reflected in physiological changes. In many ways, the experience was 'real,' mentally and physiologically. This study suggests to me that the dream cognitions drive the physiology. </p>

<p>Twenty-six years ago when I first began to dream consciously or lucidly at age 16, my very first lucid dreams did not have sexual elements in them. What they had, however, was an extraordinary sense of near ecstasy -- a deep swelling sense of energy, feelings of complete and utter freedom, and an astounding visual and mental clarity. These ecstatic feelings were often most acute when flying. </p>

<p>When talking with other lucid dreamers about their first lucid dream, no one has ever mentioned sex in their first lucid dream. However, many have mentioned a feeling of near ecstasy and joy, often accompanied by flying. At some later point, most lucid dreamers learn they can direct the energy of the dream towards sexual expressions. </p>

<p>These points may suggest that the energy felt in a lucid dream is an experience of a basic or universal creative energy with the sexual component being one part, which we learn through association or conscious desire to pursue. In a similar vein, Carl G. Jung broke with Freud's view of the libido as primarily sexual and came to view the libido as a psychic energy, an expression of the "intensity of the psychic process." </p>

<h2>Id, Ego, Libido, Lucidity: Why does it matter?</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Freud made an attempt to conceptualize the Psyche, how it was composed, how it functioned or dysfunctioned. He likened the conscious to the tip of an iceberg supported by a massive unconscious underneath. Dreams were very important in this schema, because dreams expressed symbolically the activity of the unconscious and shed light on one's motivations, perceptions and behaviors.</p>

<p>One hundred years later, what do we really understand of the Psyche and the role of dreams in it? Robert Bosnak's book, <em>Tracks in the Wilderness of Dreaming</em>, explored this area. He strenuously questioned "Who is the dreamer?" in his attempt to understand the fantastic, awesome, incredible creativity of dreams and "who" was behind them. Similarly I ask "Where is the dreamer? Where do we place the dreamer in our conception of the psyche?" Moreover, "If the dreamer is in the Unconscious, then where is the lucid dreamer?" And finally, "If the lucid dreamer is aware in the Unconscious, why do we not use lucid dreamers to begin to map out the characteristics of the Unconscious-the characteristics of the Psyche?" </p>

<p>The commonality of experience of lucid dreamers as they consciously act in the dreaming environment suggests that there may be a framework, a set of principles, of unconscious processes available in dreaming to be theorized and tested. If these principles could be explored and identified, then we could move beyond general conceptualizations and more clearly define the reality of the dream state and perhaps, the unconscious. </p>

<p>As minister and dreamworker <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> has said many times, "Dreams come to enhance our health and wholeness." All dreams, including lucid ones, are an opening to our wholeness. Let's find the dreamer. Let's claim our wholeness.  </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Dreams are a very important aspect of our daily lives that need more conscious attention and consideration. Whether we dream in vague snippets or full-blown epic movies, the information your sleeping mind is sharing should not be overlooked. With more focus and value given to your dreams, you will remember more dreams and learn incomparable lessons. </p>

<p>I have found that dreams can fall into ten different categories. When approaching dreams, know that several categories may apply to one dream. The deeper you explore, the more levels of meaning you can find. I present these categories so that you may begin to look at your own dreams to discover the multidimensional aspects within these nightly scenarios. </p>

<h2>1. Daily Wash or Review Dreams</h2>

<p>These are the most common of dreams and, unfortunately, are often easily dismissed. An example might be: you have dinner with a friend and that night you dream about having dinner with this friend. In the dream, you have all the food on your side of the table as your friends sits there watching you eat. Suddenly, she begins crying uncontrollably. Then, as you watch, she turns into a small, wounded bird fluttering on the chair, seeming to cry out for attention. You are then changed in to a colorful parrot talking a mile a minute. There are several possible reasons for having this type of dream: </p>

<p>a) The dream might be showing you explicitly the choices you made. With the food on your side of the table, you become aware that you were the one nourished through your encounter with your friend.</p>

<p>b) The dream might be sharing reactions you overlooked. Your subconscious picks up on subtle emotional nuances and presents them to you in the dream. Your friend was upset and you were not consciously aware of this, thus your dream presents her emotional state in a dramatic version so that you will listen. </p>

<p>c) A third reason for this type of dream might be to act as a character study. Through these bird symbols, you clearly understand each of your roles from the previous evening. In a waking state you can now correct the imbalances from your dinner by calling to listen, support and nourish your friend. Rather than quickly tossing these dream images aside, look more closely into the messages behind dreams. Please don't dismiss any dream fragments or "obvious" messages; dreams are more complex and deserve your attention. </p>

<h2>2. Character Review Dreams</h2>

<p>Most characters presented in dreams are an aspect of yourself. When you dream about your mother she is likely to be personifying an aspect of yourself of which you may not be aware. When friends from the past pop up in a dream, you should look back either to your relationship with them or the time period you knew them to see what messages they present. The "character review" category can serve several functions: </p>

<p>a) It can highlight your own strengths. Perhaps your dream shows positive aspects about yourself that you are presently overlooking. For example, you dream about a beautiful dancer being showered with roses upon her curtain call. She then presents the roses to you backstage. The dream is showing your potential for sharing creativity with others and being rewarded. However, consciously you have put these talents "backstage" and the dream is showing you the rewards of bringing them "on stage". </p>

<p>b) It can point out weaknesses. You dream about standing in line, then you get stuck in traffic and then your date is late. When you awaken, you see the comedy in this frustrating dream and understand your own need to be patient with circumstances that are out of your control. </p>

<p>c) It can also give suggestions for balancing. You dream about being chained to your desk with mounds of work in front of you. Meanwhile, outside the window, you see people playing. You wake up knowing that "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," and you vow to take more time for yourself. </p>

<h2>3. Problem Solving Dreams.</h2>

<p>Dreams are very helpful, like a good friend trying to relay messages to you... all you have to do is ask. There are several ways these problem solving tools can be used. </p>

<p>a) Dreams can present business or study advice. One night, I gave myself a pre-sleep suggestion about whether to take a job I was considering. That night, I dreamt that I was walking a close, unidentified friend to the elevator in a high rise apartment building. I turned to go back down the hall to my apartment. Suddenly, the elevator cable snapped and I heard the elevator crash to the bottom, my friend screaming. I woke up and immediately knew I shouldn't take this particular job because it could" crash" to the ground and in the process I would lose something close to me.</p>

<p>b) Dreams can aid in interpersonal clarification. You are having some misunderstandings with your spouse and you go to bed upset. That night, your dream shows you some key to this conflict, and you awaken with a resolution and a better understanding of your partners feelings. </p>

<p>c) They can give clues for the best choice to be made. Perhaps you are considering moving and have narrowed your choice down to several locations. Still undecided, you go to sleep and you dream about the most appropriate location for you. Dreams may not be presented in a literal scenario, but when working with the symbols of the dream, the deeper meaning becomes much more evident. Listen to your own inner voice or "heart" to validate your impressions. As the dreamer, you will know when you've "gotten" the message from your dream. </p>

<p>d) Finally, dreams can share suppressed emotions about a situation. In college, my sister and I had many misunderstandings. I dreamt shortly before shew as getting married that her best friend and I completely missed the wedding. We showed up without our bridesmaids' dresses on, embarrassed to be so late. My dream warned me about my negative feelings and how they could potentially sabotage my sister's wedding. </p>

<h2>4. Body &amp; Health Awareness Dreams.</h2>

<p>Dreams can:</p>

<p>a) Show imbalances</p>

<p>b) Give health-aid suggestions</p>

<p>c) Share mental or emotional effects on the body. </p>

<p>Perhaps you dream about a vicious dog attacking your stomach and ripping out your intestines. Your doctor (or someone you don't actually know in waking life, but this person reminds you of your doctor) appears, leading a cow. You awaken, aware that this stomach pain could be a serious problem, perhaps an ulcer. Your dream shows the importance of making an appointment to see your doctor and that you should drink more milk to soothe your ulceric problems. The dog is showing how your uncontrollable anger, even if suppressed, is the cause of this attack on your stomach and intestines. Dreams are not always presented so simplistically as these examples, and you may not be aware of their meaning upon waking; however, if given attention, dreams will make their meaning clear and relay their individually unique message. </p>

<h2>5. Inspiration Dreams.</h2>

<p>a) Dreams can give specific answers to questions. My brother, a computer scientist, has told me of going to bed exhausted from working on an unsolved issue. In the morning, the solution to the problem is clear! Dreams used for problem solving and inspiration have been greatly noted by a variety of people such as scientists, writers and other artists, and business people. </p>

<p>b) Dreams can show creativity in action. During college, I was taking a choreography class. I took a short nap before rehearsal one day. In my dream, I woke up at 6:10 pm., although the meeting was to begin at 5:00. I dashed over to the studio and everyone had already been working for over an hour. In the dream, we completed the dance and felt very creative. When I woke up, it was indeed 6:10pm. AGH! My partners had left by then without working on our project. The next day, I shared the dance ideas presented in my dream and many of these ideas were incorporated into our final dance project! So my dreams were working on my dance project even though my body was sleeping. </p>

<p>c) Dreams can provide motivation to continue in a specific creative endeavor. As an actress, there are times when I lose sight of my goals. Usually during this time, I will dream of being cast in a great role and I wake up with renewed determination. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Author's Note: Dreams come in many forms with many messages and levels of interpretation. I have found that dreams fall into ten different categories. These categories overlap, giving varied depth of meaning to even "simple" dreams. I previously discussed the first five categories (DNJ Vol. 11 No.1). Now I'd like to complete the list so that you may use this to cross-reference your own dreams. It is very important to remember and give attention to these nightly scenarios.</em> </p>

<h2>6. Bad Dreams or Nightmares</h2>

<p>Everyone has had a bad dream at some point in their lives. Often these are the only dream experiences remembered. With an on-rush of adrenaline, you wake with a start and the emotions overwhelm you while reliving those scary scenes. "Bad" dreams, above all, should be paid close attention. There are several possible reasons for these types of dreams. </p>

<p>a) Nightmares shock you into remembering and/or facing certain fears, emotions, or blocks. Your conscious mind hasn't gotten the message (you don't remember the "simpler" dreams or else you don't pay attention to their messages). So your subconscious "slaps you awake" with a scenario that is so dramatic that you will remember and with such an emotional impact that it has an effect! Unfortunately, most people treat nightmares as "only a dream". Instead, the dreamer should view these dreams as highly important - kind of a last, drastic attempt by the subconscious to get through. Take a look at the dream characters and actions, break them down to specific characteristics and see how they might apply to your waking life. </p>

<p>b) They are acting out possible negative scenarios to release negative energy. It shows you that waking reality isn't so bad. All actors are familiar with "the actor's nightmare". You go out on stage to do a musical and suddenly the rest of the cast is doing Shakespeare. You're in the wrong costume and you don't know any of the lines! AGH! At the next rehearsal in your waking life, everyone else is still doing the same show you thought you were in. Relieved by this affirming reality, you have more confidence as you step onto the stage. </p>

<p>c) Nightmares personify negative feelings in order to deal better with fears. Shirley MacLaine, at her Higher Self Seminar, shared a recurring childhood nightmare. In the dream, she was being chased by a huge, mean gorilla. She ran and ran, barely keeping out of reach of the gorilla. Finally, she came to the edge of a cliff. This is where she usually woke up - terrified! One night, she was having the same dream, only this time when she reached the edge of the cliff, she turned. "What do you want?" she cried out to the gorilla. He replied, "I don't know, little girl. It's your dream." This humorous anecdote shows how we create the scary images from our dreams and we can control the outcome. By understanding what is behind our fear, we can overcome the possible negative outcome and make that dream character our ally. </p>

<p>d) Coming out of the dream state into a more wakeful state, the conscious mind can become aware of and evaluate the dream material. Those dreams where you are berng chased but can't move are likely to be times when the conscious mind checks in on the dream, yet realizes the body is "frozen" in its R.E.M. stage, thus the feeling of not being able to move. The conscious mind doesn't realize that this state is a dream and panics, waking you up in distress. Please don't brush aside these bad dreams just to relieve yourself. These are important dreams with important messages and should be given your waking focus. If you ignore these dreams, then the problems or difficult situations are almost forced to manifest in your waking life. </p>

<h2>7. Clarification Dreams</h2>

<p>Further dreams can:</p>

<p>a) Clarify previous dreams</p>

<p>b) Give a clearer message </p>

<p>c) Using the same symbol, show a different scenario that clarifies that symbol. </p>

<p>For example, I had several dreams about my highschool vocal coach. The first time I dreamt about him, I assumed the dream content would relate to his life at that time. Since we are still friends, I contacted him, but he could not confirm the dream's message as relating to him. So I asked my dreams for clarification. My next dream dealt with my own career progress at that time and was easily interpreted. Again, I asked for dream clarification about my former voice teacher. The next time I dreamt about this man, I clearly understood that he represented a time when I was very clear about my career aspirations. He had personally been very supportive of my desires. He, as a symbol, represented the support of those goals. Now when he appears in my dreams, it is usually at a time when I really need this support.</p>

<h2>8. Assistance for Others</h2>

<p>They can give:</p>

<p>a) General aids</p>

<p>b) Insight into specific problems (often seen symbolically rather than literally)</p>

<p>c) Symbolic understanding of trends and probable future events. Just like in your own "body and health awareness" dreams, you can pick up on health problems in a close friend or family member. But it doesn't have to be specifically health-related. You can dream about a brother who is overworking himself; in the dream he begins to make mistakes, eventually getting fired. You can check with this brother to see if he is indeed overworking himself. In any dream that seems to deal directly with another person, check with that other person first to see if the dream has significance for them. However, whether it has significance for the other or not, realize that you had the dream for a reason! Maybe you are overworking yourself and can't see it, so the dream non-threateningly shares this information. It is important to take the dream content back to the dreamer and apply the messages and symbols, however subtle, to the dreamer's personal life. </p>

<h2>9. Psychic Awareness Dreams</h2>

<p>This category gets the most phenomena attention. Most people have had at least one form of psychic awareness through a dream. The most common are:</p>

<p>a) Connections with "other world" people. Your grandmother has died recently and one night you dream that she visits to tell you that she is all right and very safe. "There is nothing to fear in death. I am still with you", she shares. Another common experience is </p>

<p>b) Telepathy about past, present or future events for: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yourself. For example, you dream about skidding on the ice and your car swerves off the road. The next day as you travel in those winter conditions seen in your dream, you are particularly cautious. Your car hits the ice patch and you are able to correct your car before sliding off into the ditch. </p></li>
<li><p>Your friends or family. You dream that your mother falls down the stairs. The next day, because of your awareness from this dream, you stop by your mother's house and arrive just after she indeed has fallen. By your prompt arrival, the situation turns out to be much less serious. </p></li>
<li><p>Your community. Many people in a community often dream about a significant event that will happen in their area. For example, some might dream about a tornado hitting their town. When weather conditions sour a few days later, they are more prepared to face the potential disaster. </p></li>
<li><p>National or global. Several people, including the President, foresaw Lincoln's assassination in their dreams. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, the important thing to do with these clairvoyant dreams is first to react to them literally. Then look internally to see why that dream might have significance for you personally. Perhaps your emotional life is about to experience a "tornado" and you need to go within to your "shelter" to withstand the impending storm. A third psychic category is:</p>

<p>c) Past-life memories. You awaken from a very vivid dream about life during King Arthur's reign. The dream seems so much more "real" than waking life. All day you can't shake the images. Perhaps you are tuning into past-life memories of a life during that time period. As with any past-life work, it is important to apply any insights, messages or lessons to the present. By tuning into that past life during King Arthur's reign, you may rekindle that feeling of a noble and charitable life, when standing up for "right" did enable "might". </p>

<h2>10. Spiritual Connection Dreams</h2>

<p>These dreams can share: </p>

<p>a) Spiritual lessons</p>

<p>b) Universal truths</p>

<p>c) Unconditional love </p>

<p>d) Connection with "angels", guides, teachers, your Higher Self, and God. </p>

<p>I had an incredible dream experience a few years ago that falls under this category. The dream was very long and complicated, but one section I'd like to share: </p>

<p><em>I was with a close friend. When I looked over at him, we zoomed out of our bodies and flew up high over the earth. The earth looked so clear and beautiful. When we returned to earth, we did not rejoin our bodies. Instead, when I looked at my friend, I saw only his etheric body, vibrant energy and light! As I looked into this energy field, I saw in a flash (not like in a movie, but instant knowing) all of his many lives and experiences. When I looked down at my own energy field, I was of the same type of energy and light and also knew all that I'd ever experienced. We discussed the many choices we'd made and laughed at how complicated we'd made life, how many times we'd lost perspective. Then an overwhelming feeling of unconditional love swept over me.</em></p>

<p>It was like <em>nothing</em> I'd ever experienced before! This experience left me with a heightened perspective and love flowed over into all areas of my life. </p>

<p>Dreams are a precious gift we receive nightly. By learning to remember and unravel the various layers, dreams can add a special awareness to our loves and the choices we make. Dreams can be likened to a nightly therapy session. The only cost is the attention to explore these rich, nightly scenarios. Keep these categories in mind when viewing your own dreams and good luck in this rewarding avenue of personal discovery. </p>

<p>We suffer pain or trauma or abuse.  We are compelled to make a painful life choice, such as leaving a partner or a job or a home, and part of us resists that choice and still clings to the old relationship or the old place. Sometimes the choice is not even ours and we experience a deep sense of loss. We fall into depression or addiction or make compromises with the world as we understand it, thus giving up on our big dreams of life and leaving a piece of us behind. </p>

<p>We all know the pain of needing to let go, while continuing to hold on for dear life. We ebb and we flow, we gain and we lose, we love and we long for. Meanwhile our dreams remind us that we have left something behind, a part of our self, a part of our soul.</p>

<p>Bestselling author and world-renowned dream explorer Robert Moss addresses this subject in his newest book, <em>Dreaming The Soul Back Home: Shamanic Dreaming for Healing and Becoming Whole</em>. Moss understands that these challenging life situations often create a loss of our vital life energy and identity, and he adroitly speaks to the healing affects that dreams have on recovering these lost aspects of our souls. </p>

<p><em>Dreaming the Soul Back Home</em> is a practical tool and experiential guide in soul recovery and of all of Moss’s books, this is my favorite. “Dreams not only show us what the soul wants, they also show us where it has gone,” writes Moss. He teaches us about soul loss, what it is, how it happens, and how dreams come to us to assist in the healing process. He shares common presentations of dream imagery that we can all relate to when some aspect of soul loss has affected us. “We dream again and again of the old place, or Grandma’s house, or high school, or the house we shared with a former partner. These dreams may be telling us that we left part of our vital energy and identity in that phase of our lives. Or, we may dream of a younger same-sex companion and find we are dreaming of a younger aspect of ourselves that went missing at her age because of bad things that were happening… Again and again in dreams, our higher or Greater Self comes stalking us, giving us the chance to forge a connection that may bring more of soul or spirit into the body than was with us before.”</p>

<p>Dreams, in their infinite wisdom and homeopathic nature help us to reunite with these lost parts of ourselves so that we may bring more of our spirit back into our body to live a fuller, more complete life. Infused with an indigenous quality in approach, this is a breakthrough book on a subject that deserves deep attention and care because we all experience this type of soul loss at some point in our lives. </p>

<p><em>Dreaming the Soul Back Home</em> consists of 15 chapters, including Dreamers as Shamans, Understanding Soul Loss, Dream Roads to Wholeness, The Royal Road to Soul Recovery, House of Healing and Ancestral Healing and Spiritual Release. Numerous exercises are given throughout the book allowing the reader to work with his various techniques first-hand. In addition, Moss shares many examples of the ways in which soul speaks to us through dreams.</p>

<p>This book is a must-have for anyone who is interested in dreamwork because it is so unique and insightful. I found myself fascinated by every chapter and I experienced epiphanies throughout my entire reading of Moss’s book. He shared new ways of working with dreams that I had not considered and I embraced the idea of becoming my own shaman so that I could help promote my own healing and wholeness. This book is an exquisite addition to the dreaming community and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys working with dreams for personal growth, development and healing.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zmstar-0.jpg" alt="Constellations" /></p>

<p>There are times when Dreams take us on unexplored roads to learn new things. Such is my case. Several years back I had dreams where I was specifically requested to look up information about the Constellation of Bootes and I did so. But, that’s all I did; I learned a few details about what Astronomers knew then about Bootes and let it go recorded and forgotten into my dream journal. I didn’t bother, at the time, to integrate any information about Bootes to anything pertinent in my life.</p>

<p>Time passed and then I was again presented with the opportunity to learn something new, only this time it did not come as easily. I dreamt that...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am talking with a wonderful middle-aged man who is obviously avery good friend of mine, even though in real life I do not know this person. We talk about our families and hobbies and then decide to take a walk. We walk for a while, then enter a restaurant and sit down to eat something. I look out the window closest to me and see some reflected shadowy movement. I standup, move in closer to take a good look and see two beautiful peacocks, red and shimmering in glowing red light. I am so enthralled with the view that I call out to my friend and tell him I am seeing two very eccentric, red peacocks shimmering in red light! My friend comes overfrom the table, looks at them,smiles and tells me, “They are not eccentric, this is the way they are supposed to be... and still are!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awoke that morning feeling very well but knowing that I had to go learn about the “two red peacocks.”I knew the message inherent in the dream was important and decided to hit the search engines and see what I could come up with. I looked up “Peacock” in mythology and learned a lot in that area. I kept looking up the birds’ habits and felt it was nice information but nothing that really made me feel that I had come uponthe right interpretation. Being bilingual, I placed the word “Peacock” in Spanish, “Pavo,” and the Constellation of Pavo was displayed on the screen. As I read the description of the Constellation and learned it was made up of two very uneven but bright red primary and companion stars, I sensed that this was the information I was seeking.</p>

<p>I translated most of the article into Spanish and emailed it to my study group in South America. The response came quickly. About two days later they advised me that the investigation for “Pavo” was underway! They were to investigate and correlate some important spiritual facts about this constellation and they thanked me for the information. Needless to say that if I was confused at first on how to get information on the peacocks, I was evenmore confused when it was confirmed that the information received in my dream was correct and needed! It was a very powerful realization to learn how little knowledge I had of the heavens regarding Astronomical and Astrological points of view.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of new work habits in my dream journals. Everytime I had a dream, I went straight to an astrological calendar and took a look at what was happening up there in the sky. I did not even know what I was looking for, but I took a tremendous leap of faith and knew that someone who did know about Astrology would show up and could interpret the symbols for me. From another magazine I looked up the “fixed star” of the day and investigated the mythology behind that. This proved to be particularly helpful in understanding the “hidden opinion” behind the dream. I would then look up the Astronomer’s favorite picture for the day on the internet and also wrote it down. Another great leap of faith; since I had begun to understand the interrelatedness of everything, I knew the Cosmos up there somehow had to resonate with what was happening down here... and that the Astronomer’s sense of beauty would pick the right picture for the day.</p>

<p>Writing it all down took time, great effort, research and some experimentation so as to learn what informationwas pertinent, but it was well worth the time. I also learned that I could not choose one science above the other, but had to learn “scientifically“ from Astronomy about the wonderful Universe that surrounds us as well as the ancient mythological interpretations that were given by Astrologers. All of these two areas were important and interrelated in my dreams. As I became more familiar with these areas, wonderful new revelations were opened to me. When researching the information, the dates coincided with happenings up in the skies and cosmos.</p>

<p>The more familiar I became with Astronomical terms and visual identification of celestial bodies and Astronomy’s new discoveries, the more information I started receiving...with more “realistic and closely related visuals.” It was not long before all the detail work started to connect very well within my dreams. I would receive specific, wonderful gifts during Leonid or Quadrantid Meteor Showers, Equinoxes or Solstices. It was wonderful to discover that for several years, my healing dreams came to me during the same dates. I will never be a professional Astronomer nor Astrologer, but realize that for dreamers everywhere, these tools can be of great help and service. Using the Internet to navigate related, great sites can provide easytoreach research tools and there is free software that will allow you to keep track of the moon phases and astronomical visuals that can help, too.</p>

<h3>DREAM AUGUST 2001</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am visiting a building that specializes in Advertising and Public Relations. I am looking for someone in particular to discuss some details about something (I do not remember). I walk into a room and see thatit is in the process of being renovated, I walk into another and seethat this room is filled and busy with very delicate machinery. I walk towards the wall and notice a table with three transparent, flat, acrylic screens that are showing magnificent pictures, mainly in shades of red, orange, some grey and pockets of black. As I walk closer, I notice that the three screens are showing three sections of some remarkable picture from Space. I do not know what it is, but I know it is from outer Space. I ask the Office Manager what these are but she smiles and does not tell me. Regarding this dream, the moon was in Perigee to the Earth and it would be further clarified by the...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>ASTRONOMY CALENDAR FOR 2002</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christmas Day 2001: <em>I am unwrapping a gift from my sister that is an Astronomy Calendar for 2002. Inside the cover page is something remarkable.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I awaken screaming and go get my dream journal. My painting of the beautiful three acrylic screens and the inside cover page present the same image! It’s the center of the Galaxy as processed by the twin telescopes “Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)” in Arizona and Chile, in which they have captured the Milky Way galaxy and galaxies that lie beyond.</p>

<p>This dream genuinely surprised me. I felt the light and understood, once again, that it might have something to do with what was happening out in Space. I did more research and learned that the Earth would be in Perihelion to the Sun on January the 4th, and the Moon would be in Perigee to the Earth on January 10th. I understood then the uneven sized knobs could be representing the Earth and Moon. It was a wonderful dream!</p>

<p>I decided to use this dream as one of the three that are presented in this article, since it was taking place in a “building dedicated to Advertising and Public Relations.” My study group and I all had a good laugh at my reaction and it’s nice to have confirmation, once again, that dreams relate to what’s happening all around us... on many levels. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Familiar themes and symbols emerge to most people who record their dreams. They are components that parallel their lives above and below conscious awareness. Do these themes and symbols form pieces of your own mythology? Since dreams dip into the world of the unconscious to select their stories and dramas, they tap both the personal and collective unconscious for dream material, thus forming a unique relationship between your personal mythology and your dreams. </p>

<p>What is the definition of "myth"? Webster defines it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"...a traditional story of ostensible historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief or natural phenomenon." [1] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do your dreams reveal your world view? Certainly, your personal history is reflected through your dreams in regard the content you select from your life activities to play out in your dreams. Thus, your dreams reflect your personal 'myths' - ones in which your personal relationship can change and transform, just as your life experiences do. </p>

<p>However, the collective unconscious component adds a deeper layer to the meaning of your dreams with the appearances of the archetypal themes and symbols which reflect the primitive and ancient part of your personal mythology: Arthur Cotterell explains that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The myth in a primitive society ... was the recognition of the link between past and present established by myth in daily life. ...Jung became convinced that the individual possessed both a personal and collective unconscious; the former filled with material peculiar to the individual whereas the latter housed the common mental inheritance of mankind - the archetypes, or primordial images which 'bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote past. This psychic life .. is the mind of our ancient ancestors, the way in which they conceived of life and the world, of gods and human being.' ... No doubt the creative period of myth is set in prehistoric times.'' [2] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you track your own personal mythology through your dreams? Those who have kept dream journals for more than five years will have ample material to process; begin by reading through them finding frequent images/scenarios that you notice. Jot them down and see how your world view/ psyche has changed, remained the same or intensified - is it a map for the evolution of your own life pattern? Have your myths outgrown you - or you them? But no matter how long you have journaled - whether a novice recording the magic of the dream world or one who is well-seasoned, you will be able to recognize the emergence of your own myth material. </p>

<p>For example, several of my older dream themes had to do with hotel/motel settings; that is, temporary way stations on a journey to somewhere. It reflected my internal as well as external search for "home". Since I have found what I call home both within and in the physical world , the occurrence of a hotel or motel setting in my dreams generally has diminished. </p>

<p>Similarly, there has been an increase in circular-shaped symbols in my dreams during the past few years. For me, this equates to the archetype of the integration process of the self wanting to coalesce and evolve through internal processes. </p>

<p>In <em>Personal Mythology</em>, <a href="../@davidfeinstein">Feinstein</a> and <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Krippner</a> further explain the personal mythology process: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Many depth psychologists believe that dreams are best understood as an unfolding of the psyche and should not be distorted by intellectual interpretations. In a similar manner, you can learn to sense, without being overly intellectual, the relationship between patterns you find in your dreams and developing personal myths. Dreams serve to mediate between your daily experiences and your underlying myths, Working with your dreams can reveal changes in your mythology that are occurring outside your awareness. Dreams may support or challenge an existing myth ... and you can understand your personal mythology more fully through the instructions [symbols] of your dreams." [3] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I encourage you to examine your own dream material in this light of mythmaking; it is a template for you to observe the smaller and bigger picture of your life as it evolves through developmental stages and reveals the inner and outer journey of the self. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Houses play a major role in shaping our world view. From our earliest memories, houses reflect what our world is and who shares it with us. Housing provides shelter and protection from our environment, safety, physical comfort - a refuge - a place to go within and just be/do and take care of one's needs. It is a space that is special and highly personal and its presence is a dominant and integral image in our daily lives. </p>

<p>The popular story of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> that told about Dorothy's magical journey into her unconscious is an example of the rote that houses have in regard to how our worldviews are perceived. Dorothy 'dreamed' she was being carried through the sky on winds from a Kansas tornado and was awakened abruptly on the edge of the Land of Oz when her house was propelled to earth and dropped with a thud on a wicked witch - and killing her. Dorothy's journey to Oz and all she encountered along the way was all about getting home again - back to her beloved family and familiar surroundings. </p>

<p>Many dream reports I receive have to do with the houses that populate our dreams and what to do with the images. feelings and people related to them. The following is a dream submitted by a woman who inherited her parents' home after their death: </p>

<p><em>"I just realized that a VERY recurring theme in my (usually disturbing) dreams is that ....</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I'm in someone else's house. Most of the time, the houses are cluttered or in disarray.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I know that houses reflect my body - but that I'm "living in someone else's body" doesn't click with me. Any other ideas?"</em> ~A.M. </p>

<p>Yes, one's "dream house" can be one's body if universally interpreted, but beneath that are also personal associations and many other layers of possible meanings. Consider that you are LITERALLY living in someone else's house (your parents') and your recurring dream theme may be pointing out that your innermost being is stiLL dealing with the "clutter or disarray" of memories, feelings and circumstances surrounding your parents. The 'nudging' to go through the houses in your dreams may indicate your psyche's prompting to claim its own identity; in order to have that happen, you may have a desire to have your OWN HOUSE - one that outpictures YOU and not someone's else's tastes, configurations, etc. Also, the house is considered to be the "cosmic center" in religious rites of various cultures, e.g., tepees. huts, Lodges, which may have spiritual significance for you, too, in terms of sacred ancestral connections. </p>

<p>Also, the fact that your dream houses are cluttered, messed up, may mean that you literally have been trying to conform and "live in" someone else's "stuff'. You may sense on many levels a desire to move, clean out and clear out - and you are asking the "dream question" because you already are aware that this would be a healing step for you. Another aspect to consider is that esoterically we have more than one body: astral. causaL physical. etheric. mental spiritual. Make conscious contact with any or aU of these other "selves" and see how they "fit" you; perhaps THEY need some attainment, clearing out or adjustment? </p>

<p>Dorothy's dream search was for her home, but for you, it may be to FIND your true home. It would be important for you to ask yourself such questions as, "What does a house mean to me?"... What are the meanings I attribute to home?'' "What disturbs me about my home?" "What pleases me about it?" "If I could create my perfect house, what would it look like - what would I add - what would I leave out?" "Who would I invite to my home?" "What nourishes me in my home?" By writing out your answers, you may find further clues as to what your dream houses mean for you-and even some surprising answers. </p>

<p>Utilizing one’s own dreams for personal development is one of the most beneficial aspects of dreamwork, and one that is specifically highlighted in this exceptional book of dreams from Rachel Norments’ personal life. Page after page, Dream Explorations is filled with examples of how working with her own dreams has impacted her life journey and the numerous ways that dreams have played a tremendous role in her development personally and spiritually. </p>

<p>What stands out in Dream Explorations is the way in which Rachel has been able to go back through her years of journaled dreams and mine the gems of wisdom given her throughout her years of dreamwork even though at the time she may have not known what the dreams were telling her.  It allows the reader a bird’s eye view of where she was at in her life during the time of a particular dream, whether it be mentally, emotionally, physically or spiritually, and how her dreams commented on that state of being. She also shares the role her dreams played in moving through those times including ways healing may have been needed to propel her into the next phase of her life. It is a true testament to the immense value of writing down your dreams and working with them. </p>

<p>Throughout the book Rachel integrates various methods of working with dreams based on some of the pioneers of dreamwork including Carl Jung, <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a>, <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> and others. Rachel shares how she has used these dream techniques with her own dreams and in turn, also shows the reader ways in which to better work with their own dreams.</p>

<p>Dream Explorations covers multiple dream subjects, such as houses, food, emotions, color, water, people, animals and so much more.  Rachel spends much time discussing dream symbols and the multitude of images that have accompanied her throughout her life.  She shares not only her personal symbolism but also other possibilities so that when reading the book, one cannot help but be inspired to think of their own personal dreams and imagery in expanded ways.  She shows the reader just how enlightening the study of dreams can be and how they are here to guide us towards self-realization, balance and ultimately, for the purpose of showing us who we are meant to become.</p>

<p>A tremendous amount of time, excavation and research has gone into Dream Explorations and it is a rare look at how using our dreams as guides and teachers over a lifetime can truly direct us towards growth, healing and wholeness. </p>

    ns1:description """<p><em>Dreams provide us a portal into the soul. They emerge in unconscious states while playing out our deepest fears, joys, and emotions. When we allow space for our dream content or images, we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in this world. This article identifies the theories within depth psychology that have shaped the way that we interpret our dreams. It specifically investigates the theories of dream interpretation through association, amplification, animation, active-animation, and ritual. It furthers the discussion of self-evolution through the analysis of a dream through the lens of each of these modalities. In addition, the article expands on the self-awareness and self-reflection gleaned in the process.</em> </p>

<p>Evolution is one of the primary purposes of human life. We live, we learn, we correct, and in response, we evolve. As individuals on this Earth, we constantly look for greater meaning and assurances of our existence. The most effective way to reach our potential, growth, and evolution is through self-reflection. This led to the invention of philosophy, which later would evolve into psychology in our quest for self-actualization. A primary component of self-growth is to access our deeper unconscious states. There are twenty-four hours in a day, and based on the way we are biologically created, we spend on average around sixteen hours awake and seven to nine hours asleep.  That roughly equates to an average of 2,920 hours a year that we spend in a sleeping state. During our sleeping state, we rest, repair, and process in the form of dreams. Dreams are said to be a gateway into our soul. They provide a direct link to our unconsciousness while bypassing the inhibition of our conscious chatter. Whitmont and Perera (1989) recognize that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dream itself is a natural and necessary expression of the life force-- one that manifests in sleeping consciousness and is sometimes remembered and recounted across the threshold of waking,..it’s basic purpose is the manifestation and expression of this life force. It gives us images of energy, synthesizing past and present, personal and collective experiences (p.2).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, Berry (2000) notes the “images in our dreams are not reflections of external objects but are “inner images” (p.94). Thus, our dreams provide us with a deeper window and understanding of our internal state, feelings, fears, and hopes. If we slow down and pay attention, we can access content that can assist us on our life’s journey towards greater self-discovery and contentment. Whitmont and Perea (1989) further this discussion by noting that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In working with dreams one may encounter a feeling of profound numinosity and of wonder at the objectivity and creativity of the unknown entity we call, for lack of a better name, the Guiding Self. These feelings grow out of the experience of receiving successions of precisely relevant dream image messages and of the concomitant sense of personal growth (p. 180).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article investigates the history, methods, and benefits of dream interpretation as a means for self-discovery. It specifically focuses on the methods from a depth psychology lens with Freud and Jung's lineage and their development of association, amplification, animation, active imagination, and ritual. Furthermore, I highlight the effectiveness of these modalities through the analysis of a personal dream rich in energetic content.</p>

<h2>The Theory of Dream Interpretation</h2>

<p>Within depth psychology, Freud was the first to assert that dreams act as a window into the unconscious. He believed that dreams present us with “manifest content” while hiding the “latent content” of our unconscious thoughts, wishes, and desires (Freud, 2001, p.8). Thus, he believed that dreams are representations of our repressed thoughts and desires. Freud developed the dream interpretive method of associations of his client's dreams manifest or apparent content to access their latent or hidden content, thus providing greater insight (Freud, 2001). Patients would “free associate” what each dream image brought to their mind through the use of associations. In turn, the patient’s free association accessed the deeper unconsciousness and provided workable material that Freud would analyze (Freud, 2001). </p>

<p>Like Freud, Jung recognized that dreams are a route to our unconsciousness. However, Jung disagreed that all dreams are repressed content and instead developed the concept that dream states access a collective human psyche represented through “universal archetypes” (Aizenstat, 2011, p. 16). In response to this theory, Jung developed amplification to investigate our dream images' archetypal energies (Jung, 1974). He also began to extend dreamwork in the waking hours through active imagination (Johnson, 1986). Jung’s expansion of dreamwork allowed his analysands to engage with the unconscious in a meaningful and self-directed way. Jung (1974) underscored that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interpretation of dreams requires exact knowledge of the conscious status quo, so the treatment of dream symbolism demands that we take into account the dreamer’s philosophical, religious, and moral convictions. It is far wiser practice not to regard dream-symbols semiotically, i.e, as symptoms of a fixed character, but as true symbols, i.e., as expressions of a content not yet consciously recognized or conceptually formulated. In addition, they must be considered in relation to the dreamer’s immediate state of consciousness (p.104).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final dream interpretation theory discussed throughout this article is the use of dream tending’s animation developed by Steve Aizenstat (Aizenstat, 2011). Within dream tending, the dream image is viewed as a living embodied entity. In response to a dream Aizenstat (2011) suggests that we treat the image that appears as one would a visitor or guest. When you analyze or tend dreams in this way, you gain fresh perspectives and greater insights into the messages underlying the dream image's presence. </p>

<h2>The Dream: Lizard Devouring Snake</h2>

<p>To illustrate how dreams act as an inner guidance, I will share my own experience of a dream entitled Lizard Devouring Snake. This dream took place towards the end of October 2020. First, it’s essential to understand the context of my life at the time of this dream. I had this dream while enrolled at a Depth oriented PhD program. Two months prior to this dream, my husband and partner of ten years and I had a significant conflict which resulted in a separation and conversations contemplating divorce. Further, I felt like I was undergoing significant personal growth, development, and transformation. My life was changing rapidly. My daughter had just turned into a young adult and was preparing for her individuation journey, and I felt at the edge of the unknown. The following is my Lizard Devouring Snake dream: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am standing in the desert on a path in the red rocks. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. Ahead of me on the path, I notice a black snake slithering across the path. Suddenly, in a violent movement, a lizard appears and catches the snake's head in its mouth. The snake thrashes and writhes, trying to escape, trying to fight back. Eventually, the snake succumbs and gives up. I watch paralyzed by this action in awe and anxiety with pressure in my chest.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I woke suddenly and with a sense of panic from this dream. The images felt burnt in my eyes, and the pressure in my chest was palpable. I knew that this dream was important. As a result, I decided that this dream could act as a doorway in my self-discovery. It reminded me of all I was digesting within my academic life, and I recalled Whitmont’s (1989) assertion that “dreams are a portal to the source of life” (180). Moreover, the somatic response to this dream and the felt bodily sensations highlighted the dream's power and potential for meaning. This dream would act as my descent into the depths of myself. In the following paragraphs, I will be discussing specific theories, followed by their application in analyzing my Lizard Devouring Snake dream. In addition, I will discuss the insights and self-reflection gained along the way through the lens of these dream interpretive theories.</p>

<h2>Association: Insight into the Individual Context</h2>

<p>According to Johnson (1986), associations consist of the connections one makes with each dream image. The dream image contains “persons, objects, situations, colors, sounds, or speech” (Johnson,1986, p.52). As noted previously, Freud was the first to develop the use of associations as a means to understand dream content. However, those who followed him in succession continued to value the application of associations within their evolved theories. As such, associations should be the first act of dream symbol expansion. Jung (1974) recognized that through associations, we view the symbol in reference to our “conscious situation”, allowing the symbol to have personal meaning without having a fixed limitation (p.105). </p>

<p>Furthermore, associations help “ground the images in the personal psychological reality” while highlighting “what events emotions or feelings-painful, joyful, or seemingly indifferent-happen to come to mind in connection” with the images (Whitmont &amp; Perera, 1989, p. 35). Johnson (1986) recognizes the importance of accessing the unconscious through associations. He suggests that to apply association, a dreamer must go through each dream image and relate their associations, always ensuring to return to the image (Johnson, 1986).</p>

<h2>Lizard Devouring Snake Associations</h2>

<p>When interpreting my dream, the snake was the first image used in association. My initial response to snakes is one of fear. I’m reminded of when I was in elementary school, and the class snake bit me on the neck, or when I was in graduate school running in the desert, and I witnessed a rattlesnake lunge at my partner's feet. There’s a darkness to snakes, a deeper knowing.</p>

<p>The lizard was the next image that I chose to investigate. In this association, I am reminded of how fast they are—their stealth and strength. Living in Hawaii, I’m surrounded by lizards in the form of geckos, who are my continual companion. They live throughout my home, sing to me at night, and vie for territory with their rivals on my deck.</p>

<p>The following image to be magnified through association was the desert. When I think of the desert and Red Rocks, I’m reminded of my Master’s program in Arizona and my time there. The desert or Red rocks' image brings Sedona to my mind, representing heat, barrenness, and beauty. The red rocks of Sedona also hold significant energy and healing.</p>

<p>The final image I investigated through association was the sun and the somatic sensation of heat on my skin. Firstly, I love the sun and its warmth. There is a pleasure and safety to being outside underneath its rays. It feels energizing and transformative. The summer and hottest parts of the day have always been my favorite.</p>

<h2>Amplification: Learning from the Archetypes by Breaking down imagery:</h2>

<p>Jung expanded Freud’s dream interpretation to develop the amplification of dream images to understand their collective archetypal energy (Jung 1974). Jung’s amplification provided a doorway to the collective unconscious by recognizing myths, stories, and legends associated with the imagery (Jung, 1974). Johnson (1986) notes that “dreams draw on universal, primordial sources that are deep in the collective unconscious of all humankind” (p.60).</p>

<p>Amplification furthers our ability to recognize a “dream’s personal context with parallel and corresponding motifs from myth, fairy tale, art, literature the cultural storehouse of archetypal images. It is an explanation in mythological terms” (Whitmont &amp; Perera, 1989). When we engage in the amplification of dreams, it can open the dreamer to significant meaning and guidance (Aizenstat, 2011). It allows us to expand beyond our known associations and step into the universal or collective meanings associated with a symbol. Simultaneously, it recognizes the human psyche's interconnection with all beings and history throughout our collective experience and draws upon that knowledge for guidance.</p>

<h3>Lizard Devouring Snake Amplifications</h3>

<p>The snake is viewed as powerful and transformative throughout the world. In Ancient Greece, the snake was seen as a means of “alchemy and healing” (Andrews, 2003). In India, tantric traditions consider the snake to reside at the base of the spine, represented as kundalini energy that rises while simultaneously opening the chakra system “representing transcendence and awakening” (Ronnberg &amp; Martin, 2010, p.196). Furthermore, snakes represent healing and change, death and rebirth as they shed their skin (Andrews, 2003). Snakes are carnivorous and “swallow their prey whole” (Andrews, 2003, p.362). </p>

<p>The amplification of the lizard symbolizes psychic intuition. Lizards bask in the sun and recognize the subtlest of insect movement (Andrews, 2003). Andrews (2003) further notes that in some Native American traditions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lizard is associated with dreamtime. Dreams contain some of the subtlest perceptions of the mind of which we may not be conscious. They are translated to us through dreams to make us more conscious. These can be fears or foreshadowings, but almost always they are the things to which we do not pay attention (p.359).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amplification of the desert recognizes the harsh environmental conditions from the extreme opposites of hot and cold. Ronnberg and Martin (2010) report that deserts act as a “psychic landscape”, a place of “alienation” and “spiritual thirst” (p.116). The Ancient Egyptians believed the desert or the “red land” was desolate and ruled by the god Set. It encapsulated the disordered forces of passion and violence (Ronnberg &amp; Martin, 2010, p.116).</p>

<p>The final amplification investigated the sun, which to many represent life. “To sun-worshippers over millennia, solar rays have seemed to transfer magical properties of fertility, creativity, prophecy, healing and even (for the alchemists) a living potentiality for wholeness that dwells in every individual” (Ronnberg &amp; Martin, 2010, p.22). Furthermore, Ronnberg and Martin (2010) highlight the sun or solar knowledge ignites creativity, and “intuition taking root in darkness” (p.22). The sun or “Sol was also the ‘gold’, the ‘yellow balsam,’ the veritas, or truth, behind the capacity of immersion in moist, lunarlike feelings, moods … and dreams reflecting the magical and mercurial” (Ronnberg &amp; Martin, 2010, p.22).</p>

<h2>Animation- The living image</h2>

<p>Stephen Aizenstat’s (2011) use of animation identifies our dreams as living and embodied reality. He stresses the importance of engaging in dream interpretation or dream tending without “an agenda to interpret or judge” for when we do so, “the living image becomes stagnant, fixed and eventually dies” (Aizenstat, 2011, p.25).</p>

<p>Furthermore, Aizenstat (2011) asserts that viewing the dream image in an embodied way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our relationship with the living image deepens, a new and important possibility arises: the capacity for revelation. Living images contain many surprising insights and secrets that reveal themselves under the right conditions. We do not manufacture revelation. It happens naturally when we are attuned to living images in an embodied and receptive way. For an image to reveal something essential, it must exist in a field of acceptance, positive regard, and openness (p. 46).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process of animating an image begins with us bringing the dream image into the present moment. We accomplish this by inviting the image into the room and asking the questions “who is visiting now”, or “what’s happening here?” (Aizenstat, 2011, p.23). Asking these questions ignites curiosity and dialogue with the dream image. We receive responses that we may not have expected, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of the present moment content.</p>

<h3>Using Animation: Lizard Devouring Snake</h3>

<p>Animating my dream Lizard Devouring Snake consisted of inviting the lizard and snake's embodied images on separate occasions while I held a dialogue with each. While this can be very similar to active imagination, I decided to include it underneath animation as it specifically depended on the openness and enlightening answers of the dream images. The dialogue with each image is contained in the following sections.</p>

<h4><em>Dialoguing with Snake</em></h4>

<p>Using dream tending, I invited the snake into dialogue by first asking the question, “who’s visiting now?” (Aizenstat, 2011, p.23). While I held a conversation with the snake, I could feel the somatic sensation of the lizard biting down upon the snake's neck. This somatic recognition was palpable, and in the experience, I recognized that I’m viscerally connected to this snake image. I recognized a felt sensation that noted the snake represented my freedom and autonomy, in addition to my capacity for growth and self-exploration. The following was the response my unconscious uncovered. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Dreamer: Who’s visiting now? I noticed a pain a twinge in my somatic response to your presence. I have always been in fear of you since I was bit on the neck as a child. I mourned your devouring. You fought hard. You writhed and struggled, yet you continued to be outpowered. There’s such an awestruck beauty to your pain. How did you feel about it?</em></p>
  
  <p><em>There is a silence and a calm presence.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Snake: I feel content. It’s a cycle of life, an important of sacrifice. This is natural. The pain is natural. It’s evolutionary.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Dreamer: What’s happening here? What do you need?</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>Snake: I need you to be at peace with the shadow with the pain. I need you to embrace its natural cycles and let go of control. Stop planning. Start embracing the unknown. It will be okay. You don’t need to have perfection nor the answers. You can embrace the present moment. I’m an ancestor, a spirit guide. Guiding you on a path.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h4><em>Dialoguing with Lizard</em></h4>

<p>The invitation to dialogue with the lizard based on the dream tending animation model was similar to how I engaged the snake dream image. I sat in silence, opened up to the deeper knowing, waited, and listened. Below is the dialogue we held together:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Dreamer: Who is visiting now?</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Lizard: I am the inner self: the darkness and the fear. I devour hopes, dreams, and potential. I keep you limited and stuck. My purpose is to challenge you. I’m your nightmare state. Everything you fear encapsulated in a single form. My intention is to make you feel stuck, limited, and small. I block the path to ascension—the path to self-knowledge. I’m your ego. Your shoulds, your oughts, your whys. All of the pressure you feel.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Dreamer: What is happening here? What am I supposed to learn?</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Lizard: It’s not about your relationship. It’s deeper. You have deeper pain and turmoil. You lack faith within yourself and your capacity. I’m the manifestation of your self-doubt—the core of your inadequacy.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to this dialogue with the lizard, I noticed somatic sensations and pressure in my chest in the form of tightness and anxiety. The bodily felt sensations felt real and content-rich. As Schul (2015) suggested, when the somatic sensations arose, I monitored them, felt them, and allowed additional attention to what they may have been trying to teach me.</p>

<h2>Active imagination</h2>

<p>Similar to dreaming, active imagination accesses the unconscious and furthers our dream content. According to Johnson (1986), it “allow(s) the images to rise up out of the unconscious” while coming into the conscious mind like a “dream if you were asleep” (p.138). In active imagination, you can talk and interact with your dream images. “They answer back. You are startled to find out that they express radically different viewpoints from those of your conscious mind” (Johnson, 1986, p.138). Whitmont and Perera (1989) expand the concept of active imagination to include the meditation of the dream images through the use of art, “gestalt and psychodramatic” experiences (p.9). The psychodrama or gestalt can be in the form of movement or dance. Johnson (1986) describes active imagination as a way that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(W)e can go to these unlived parts of ourselves and experience them in a meaningful way. It is possible to live much of life on a symbolic level, and this often satisfies that unlived part of ourselves even more than if we had lived it out externally (p.208).</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, we find new and expanded information about ourselves when we engage with active imagination. It provides us greater depth into the meaning behind the dream images allowing us to engage with the unconsciousness directly. </p>

<h3>Active imagination: Lizard Devouring Snake</h3>

<p>In the following, I will discuss the vast array of experimentation I used while furthering my Lizard devouring Snake dream through active imagination. In this process, I engaged in art, poetry, sandplay, and dance and movement. Each time I engaged with the dream images, I made a deeper descent into the dream content and overall meaning gleaned from my unconscious. Within this article, I have structured the active imaginations directly correlated to how I processed them in real-time. The process took over a series of two weeks and finished with a sandplay therapeutic process.</p>

<h4><em>Art as a Means to Further the Active Imagination</em></h4>

<p>I used art as a medium to further my dream content directly after I had engaged in dialogue with the images and felt their presence. I sat in meditation, contemplating the living images' responses, and immediately pulled out my watercolors. Two images emerged from this interaction. They are included below: </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zpdlds-0.jpg" height="auto" alt="Snake and lizard" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"/></p>

<div class="caption"><span>Watercolor Representations of the active imagination of Lizard Devouring Snake. The image to the left is a close view of the lizard with the snake in its mouth. The figure to the right is the view of the action from the dreamer's point of view.</span></div> 

<p>The first watercolor image was my view of the lizard devouring the snake blocking my path in the red rock desert. I noticed in this painting that the conflict emerged directly before a fork in the path. I felt the immediate path divergence was essential to highlight. The second image that emerged was a close-up of the lizard's face and, more importantly, his eyes with the black snake in his mouth. Again, while making this image, I recognized the eyes' intensity and felt a powerful and somatically unsettling sensation in my body. Similar to the feeling of bearing into my soul.  </p>

<h4><em>The use of poetry</em></h4>

<p>Poetry, similar to art, allowed me to have a deeper dialogue with the dream content. In response, I gained greater insight, self-reflection, and awareness. While I’m not a typical poet, I spontaneously allowed the words to emerge from the unconscious space. My poem allowed me to facilitate a deeper understanding of the dream experience. The poem is included below:</p>

<pre style="font-style: italic;">

The snake slithered along the hot ground 

They were descendants of the ancestors

Gatekeepers who held the key to transformation

I watched in wonder and curiosity about the teaching they were about to impart

I am the truth

I am the witness to your souls' growth

You must step away from the fear

Stand away from the light and allow yourself to embark into the dark

The darkness and unknown within yourself hold the answers

Let go and submit

Let go of the clutching

The grasping and move with beauty and ease

Slither on the ground and find peace

Slow down the mind and look within

Stop looking to the exterior cues to guide you and go within

</pre>

<p>Upon further introspection and interpretation, I interpreted this poem to affirm the importance of my stepping into deeper intuition and self-guidance. The poem directly challenged me to trust my instinct and slow down in the process.</p>

<h4><em>Movement and dance</em></h4>

<p>I advanced my self-introspection of the Lizard Devouring Snake dream by incorporating a dance of the snake. I slithered and squirmed on the floor. I moved outwards in a free-flowing movement in the form of a circumamubulatory spiral. With each action, I dove deeper into myself.  At the end of the exercise, I laid on my stomach, and my body violently writhed and squirmed as I embodied the snake at the point of contact with the lizard clenching the snake in its jaws. I mourned. I fell into silence while noting the darkness, which felt similar to an abyss. I let go, sobbed, and grieved as I sensed the intensity of holding everything and everyone’s expectations. I had finally broke. I moved into a seated position with my eyes closed, sitting in the darkness and the unknown. I slowly started moving again in a spiral undulation but much less pronounced. My palms laid open on my knees, and I positioned myself in a way open to receive the guidance.</p>

<p>This experience of movement felt profound. The spiral-like undulations reminded me of the rise of kundalini energy similar to a snake rising up my spine and opening my chakra centers typically referred to as “spinning vortexes” (Schulz, 2015,p.188).</p>

<h4><em>Using sandplay art and meditation as a means to understand the imagery</em></h4>

<p>Dora Kalff, a swiss Jungian analyst, developed sandplay therapy in the 1950s. Sandplay uses miniatures in a tray of sand to access the unconscious (Boik &amp; Goodwin, 2000). It was my final attempt to expand my dream through active imagination. I felt humbled and grateful to have Lorraine Razzi-Freedle provide therapeutic support as I interacted with these dream images. In this therapeutic process, I used the miniatures to recreate my dream in the sand, and that action simultaneously created a container. Creating a “spontaneous three-dimensional image” of my dream, I facilitated conscious recognition while signaling containment to my inner consciousness (Atherton, 2009). As Atherton (2009) asserts, “the sand tray, like a dream, does not tell you what you already know, but it brings to life and illuminates what has remained hidden, what has been only a fleeting thought perhaps" (p.1). When seen from this light, I used sandplay as a means of being witnessed by another, containing the archetypal energy and reflecting on the wisdom the entire process had bestowed upon me. In the middle of the tray, a group of black and brown stones underneath a Lizard head with a wide-open mouth face to face in confrontation with the snake. I utilized a monkey god's image at the top of the scene and a lotus with a bowing figuring representing the humility of bearing witness to this intense interaction. The Monkey image was similar to Lorraine’s position as the container of the process, while the figure in bowing reverence represented me.</p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zpdlds-1.jpg" height="auto" alt="Snake and lizard" style="width: 400px; margin: auto;"/></p>

<div class="caption"><span>A close-up image of the sandplay process containing the confrontation of the dream Lizard Devouring Snake.</span></div> 

<p>The lizard and snake confrontation was contained with candles in a circular formation with crystals extending outwards. The candles and crystals represented the sun's energy and rays. Processing this tray with my guide and mentor, I noticed the palpable energy still present. There is a numinosity to the tray. I had felt a sense of deep, profound, soulful meaning that I wanted to integrate.</p>

<div class="caption"><span>The entire tray representing the dream Lizard Devouring.</span></div> 

<h2>Ritual: The Art of carrying it Forward</h2>

<p>The use of a ritual or a physical act integrates the dream into our consciousness (Johnson, 1986). Toni Wolff asserted that people are too often in the logical mind or their thoughts. She is quoted by Johnson (1986) as saying: “People can analyze for twenty years, and nothing below the neck is aware that anything is going on! You have to do something about it. Do something with your muscles!’’ (p.100). This led to the development of ritual or ceremony. A small reminder to both the body and the brain that you have heard the wisdom from the unconscious. According to Johnson (1986), rituals “take the essence that you have distilled from it- the meaning, insight, or basic principle that you have derived from the experience- and incarnate it by doing a physical ritual or by integrating it into your practical life” (p.197). He further notes that they don’t need to be enormous aggrandized acts, but can instead be small “symbolic acts to set up a connection between the conscious mind and the unconscious” (Johnson, 1986, p.99). </p>

<h3>Ritual and Carrying it Forward: Lizard Devouring Snake</h3>

<p>In reference to the importance of ritual, I recognize that I need to do something small that honors the dream images and messages they provided me. The rituals I have developed in response to this dream heighten my sense of perception like a lizard. They include spending time in the sun, allowing the warmth to kiss my skin, and pierce the veil to the unconscious. Further, I have enhanced my meditation practice to focus on my felt senses and intuition. </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>My work with the dream Lizard Devouring Snake opened a door within my life to greater self-awareness and understanding. I recognize the importance of this dream as it calls into question the improbable. The lizard devoured the snake within my dream, yet rationally, snakes are carnivorous and could consume the lizard. In contrast, lizards eat insects and some plant material (Andrews, 2003). This act makes the dream numinous and meaningful. Barry (2000) highlights the importance of paying attention to the unfamiliar: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the dream presents an image that goes against the way things are naturally, let’s assume such images to be of high value because they are examples of the opus contra naturam. As I understand Jung’s idea of symbols, they change the course of nature and upgrade its energy to a higher value. Hence the unnatural, unusual, peculiar image is the one being singled out and the one containing the most value (98).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, I recognize the importance of slowing down as I lean into my freedom and intuition. I am stepping away from a need to control or fix things while allowing things to develop. I am learning more about myself in this process as I progress further in my graduate work within depth psychology. I’ve recognized that I do not need to make immediate decisions regarding my relationship with my husband and that I can embrace my daughter's individuation into young adulthood. This dream has acted as a catalyst in my life, allowing me to redefine my most profound relationships while simultaneously providing greater space and nourishment towards myself as I allow things to grow and transform.   </p>

<p>In 2004-2005, I had a series of dreams which guided me to write a book. The first one came out of the blue and caused me to change my life course towards this writing endeavour, but in the subsequent months and years a number of other dreams came which helped clarify my path. </p>

<h2>The first dream - Inspiration</h2>

<p>The first dream was one which encouraged me to delay work on my own dreams, in favour of working on “new systems”. At the time, I interpreted this to mean a book that would be a collection of dream interpretation models - in effect, a “universal system of models”.</p>

<p>To explain, every few years I think, “Well, now I can leave teaching counselor education and work exclusively on my own dreams, particularly my spirituality dreams”. To date, my dreams had dissuaded me from leaving counselor education. </p>

<p>The dream, which I subsequently titled “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book”, is one of those dissuasion dreams. It came one night after a day in which I intensely thought about my plans to work exclusively on my own dreams. I thought I had completed my counselor education work by preparing a lessons book for a distance education course about relationship dreams. </p>

<h3>Dream (May 31, 2004):</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am typing on the computer my husband and I named, “Our Majesty”. All of a sudden I see a bag with some pink liquid that has squirted out of Our Majesty. First, I think I need to have the pink liquid in the computer, but then I think, Oh, I could operate it without that liquid because some liquid would be left. I do think that my computer may squeak a little because of being low on the liquid, as do most machines. As I sit, my former accounting advisor comes and says that the university is going to put in completely new computer systems, and I am one targeted to be the administrator. I am quite surprised. I say, “Here I am, one who doesn’t know all that much about computers, and so I am quite curious why I would be top of the list to administer these new systems”. It isn’t a done deal, I need to apply. We walk together. I say to my advisor that I work with my dreams, and I say, “This project isn’t in that line”. He doesn’t seem to respond to that.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>My advisor doesn’t explain what would be entailed with the job. I am left without knowing much about it. He does tell me this will be a year and a half commitment, and I either tell him or think to myself I just wouldn’t want to be away from working with my own dreams for a year and a half. I feel resistant and strained in doing this. He obviously thinks it is something I should do. Later, a young woman tells me I need to get the application for systems administrator filed within a week. I am not the only one applying for the job.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>I still debate whether I want to do this. I ask her what the job entails, and she gives me a few more details than my advisor did, but still doesn’t give many details, and on waking I have no recall of what she said.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering this dream through the lens of PMID Step 2 <em>(Day-before-dream thoughts that connect to this dream)</em>, I had a number of insights. The day before my “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book” dream, I studied three dreams I had on August 19, 1995. One directed me to “share my food” with adopted children, meaning to give the same degree of devotion to people outside my family as to my family. Using that connection, a possible theme for “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book”, would be: “Food to share”. Thus, what symbolic food does this dream show to share? Quite simply, my Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID) that I developed during my master of counselor education thesis research. However, I didn’t understand that answer at the time of this dream.</p>

<p>Though at the time of this dream I realized the dream meant to delay work on my own spirituality dreams, I had no idea of how long I would work on this “universal systems book”. It would be far more than a <em>year and a half commitment</em> shown in the dream. The greatest delay came when I misinterpreted the “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book”, dream to mean that I had been targeted to invite other dream work authors to write chapters in a book I would administer. That collection of dream interpretation models would, thus, be a universal system of models.</p>

<p>Using connections to my intense thoughts from the day before this dream (when I intensely thought about my plans to work exclusively on my own dreams), a possible thought-question this dream responded to could be: “Am I coming close to having time to devote exclusively on working with my own dreams?” </p>

<p>Did this dream answer that question? My former accounting advisor <em>did tell me that this is a year and a half commitment</em>. Three years and five months after this “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book” I finally understood the true intent of this dream! The answer to my thought-question was no - I am not close to having time to devote exclusively on working with my own dreams. </p>

<p>Some details in the dream I did understand at the time of my “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book”, (May 31, 2004) included from PMID Step 3 (Major dream phrases and symbols defined in the context of this dream) were: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Typing on my computer that my husband and I named “Our Majesty”:</strong> Our Majesty was the computer that I used exclusively for my own dreams at the time of this dream. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pink liquid that has squirted out of Our Majesty:</strong> Antifreeze is pink liquid my husband puts in our camper pipes so they won’t freeze during winter. We don’t use our camper in the winter. Here it means to put my plans about working exclusively with my own dreams on hold. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer may squeak a little because of being low on the liquid:</strong> This represents the difficulty I could face if I failed to put my own exclusive dreams on hold. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advisor obviously thinks it is something I should do:</strong> The universal systems book is something I should do. Use my experiences to write the book.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The prominent relationship in this dream (PMID Step 6) is with my former accounting advisor. My most prominent memory about him was that he said his preparation years enabled him to do what he wanted to do all along—teach. He advised me to use my experiences to teach, which I eventually did. As to this current dream, my reaction to trust in his wisdom gave me confidence that whatever the new universal system is, it must be valuable.</p>

<p><strong>How I originally interpreted <em>completely new systems</em>:</strong> I originally interpreted the dream phrase, <em>completely new systems</em>, meant a collection, a system, of contemporary dream interpretation models. Thus, I invited other dream interpretation developers to write chapters in the proposed book tentatively titled, <em>Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models</em>. Within the Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models book I placed emphasis on other dream interpretation models and left minimal room to present my PMID model.</p>

<h2>The second dream - Guidance and encouragement</h2>

<p>In the meantime, (during the three years and five months after my “Targeted To Write A Universal Systems Book” dream, many guiding dreams came. </p>

<p>For instance, approximately five years before I sent a proposal to Routledge publisher’s main office in England, a precognitive dream foretold the city of the eventual publisher for the book that we eventually titled <em>The Counselor’s Guide For Facilitating The Interpretation of Dreams, Family and Other Relationship Systems Perspectives.</em> </p>

<p>The full meaning of this dream was not clear to me until later, but at the time it was a very encouraging dream. At the time I was thinking about which publishing company I should consider for offering my new book. When in due course my book changed course and did end up on the desk of a New York editor, I knew my book was in the right place. </p>

<h3>Young Man Says, “I’ll Bet You Will Be in New York Next” (August 30, 2004)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dream:</strong> <em>I am sitting at a table listening to a presentation with other people. A young man is explaining to us how to do some kind of application, for want of better description. I feel like an odd person to be in this setting, somewhat as if “this doesn’t fit in my circumstances”.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Later there is another meeting. I get all dressed to go to that meeting, but I decide I won’t go. The meeting is going on in the next room. I am wondering how many people are there, if enough showed up to encourage the presenter.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>After the meeting the young man presenter comes into this room where I am and talks to me about his presentation. He points to something I have written on a couple pieces of paper.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>I don’t have my glasses on, so I really don’t see what he points to. He is talking about whatever it is that I could apply for or join something that one needs to do to be accepted on something. He continues upbeat. He doesn’t even act as if I haven’t paid much attention.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>The scene changes and I am walking down a walk in an open area with this young man. He says to me, “I bet you will be in New York next ____” – Did he say year? He definitely did say, “I bet you will be in New York next”. I am surprised and a bit thrilled about that.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PMID Step 2 <em>(Day-before-dream thoughts that connect to this dream)</em>: The day before this dream I thought intensely about who I would work with on this new book, and I asked for a dream about that. Yet, I thought, I really don’t need to know now after all. What I need to do is to begin to write the book. </p>

<p>However, I neither understood the “Young Man Says, I’ll Bet You Will Be In New York Next” dream at the time I dreamed it nor five years later when I sent a proposal to Routledge’s main office in England. Then the England editorial assistant forwarded my proposal to a <em>young man in New York</em> who was interested in dreams, Dana Bliss, a young male editor for Routledge of New York at the time. Notice this precognitive dream came just three months after my “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book” (May 31, 2004) dream.</p>

<p>I continued to make preparations for the textbook as a contemporary dream interpretation models book, a compilation of several dream interpretation models. With that plan, I moved my Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID) to last in the book. Then a dream disagreed with my waking-life plan. Writers’ dreaming minds catch ever so many details, including omissions, as the next dream shows.</p>

<h2>The third and fourth dreams - Clarification</h2>

<p>Three years and five months after my “Targeted To Write A Universal Systems Book” dream, I had a correcting dream which I titled “Feeling Distraught About Moving Away from the House that I love”. Symbolically speaking, the “House that I Love” is my researched Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID).</p>

<h3>Feeling Distraught About Moving Away From The House That I Love (October 25, 2007)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>John (my husband) and I are going to move to another house in this same town. I feel distraught. I love this house we live in… I realize I had a dream about moving to that other house and so I definitely will follow my dream, but I just am very unenthused about that other house. I see it in my mind’s eye as a two story older house with weathered – needs paint – siding. It is a white house. I think about “well I haven’t looked at it in a while so I will drive over there”. But I just feel unenthused about moving… But I say to John “I’m going to look that dream up to make sure I understood it correctly”.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>PMID Step 1: Connect pre-dream current events and circumstances (most often, day before) the dream contents to identify the context or category of the dream.</h3>

<p>Yesterday I submitted a colleague and my article to a journal editor, the last project before I continue to work on the textbook of several contemporary dream interpretation models... </p>

<h3>PMID Step 2: Connect pre-dream thoughts (emotionally charged thoughts, especially) to dream contents by treating the dream as a responsive answer to pre-dream thoughts:</h3>

<p>Yesterday I thought “So now it is time to work exclusively on the textbook I am putting together of several contemporary dream interpretation models…”</p>

<h3>PMID Step 3: Major dream phrases (and symbols) defined in the context of this dream.</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>John (my husband) and I are going to move to another house in this same town:</strong> In the context of this dream, the next project on my desk that I plan to complete — the “Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models” textbook. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>I love this house we live in:</strong> In the context of this dream, the Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Realize I had a dream about moving to that house and so I definitely will follow my dream:</strong> Yes I had a dream – “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book” - that I understood to mean to put a contemporary dream interpretation textbook together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>See it in my mind’s eye as a two story older house with weathered – needs paint – siding:</strong> This “old weather house” is representative of the dream interpretation models in the books that are already published – old books by now — the books I was describing in my “Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models” textbook drafts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about “well haven’t looked at it in a while so will drive over there”:</strong> Will look at the books in the Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models book I am putting together at the time of this dream.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>PMID Step 4: Dreaming and waking life emotions compared about the dream issue or relationship</h3>

<p>During my dream “But I just feel unenthused about moving” to the Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models as the focus in the “Targeted to Write a Universal Systems Book” dream. I feel distraught about leaving the PMID model as a minor part of the book and moving to these old models as the focus.</p>

<h3>PMID Step 5: Solutions or suggestions on changing (or affirming) thoughts, attitudes or behaviors. Look for answers to day-before-your-dream thoughts.</h3>

<p>This dream suggestion is to look again at my May 2004 dream to see what it really means. </p>

<p>This third dream, and the next one that follows, were the ones that clarified the form the book would take. Up until this point, I’d been focused on writing a ‘systems book’ in the sense that it would give an overview of different models of dream interpretation. This dream encouraged me to put this focus instead on my own researched model, the Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID).</p>

<h3>If the PMID Model is Presented Last, There Won’t be Time During the Semester for Students to Understand How to Use the Model (February 26, 2005)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dream:</strong> <em>I am riding in the front seat of a car or van with a couple of other people. The one sitting next to me is a young woman. There’s someone on the other side of her with whom she visits about dreams. I am sitting in the driver’s position. I am just sitting here enjoying listening to these young women talk about their dreams. They just tell their dreams; I don’t recall much about they're trying to interpret them; perhaps they do, but it is mostly telling their dreams.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>After a while I start to explain to the young woman next to me how to use the PMID model. She gets the first step (discover the theme of the dream). I tell her about thoughts (that prompted this dream), but she doesn’t seem to understand the step about thoughts with only talking. I explain, “You need to write your day-before-your dream thoughts down”. I don’t feel hurried as I take the time to explain this step. However, the catch is that we are almost to our destination, so there isn’t time to explain the rest of the PMID model steps as thoroughly as she needs for her to be able to use it to interpret her dreams. I do feel pressed about there not being enough time to explain how to use the full PMID model.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>PMID Step 1 (Day-before-dream events that connect to this dream):</em> The evening before this dream I did a little work on the first of the two chapters on the PMID model that I planned to include at the end of my proposed <em>Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models</em>. The contemporary dream interpretation models were earlier in the book. </p>

<p>In the context of this dream <em>front seat of a car or van</em> represents the book Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models, which was the title of the textbook at the time of this dream. That <em>I am sitting in the driver’s position</em> shows that I am the “administrator”, coordinator of the book, and could have the “driving say” for where the PMID model goes in the book.</p>

<p>The other dream interpretation models I plan for the <em>Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models</em> book in process are represented when I am <em>listening to these young women talk about their dreams</em>… During the dream I don’t recall much about them trying to interpret their dreams. That is, the other methods are minimal self-interpretation. In contrast, the PMID model is one in which the dreamer interprets the dream; when a counselor is involved the counselor facilitates the dreamer’s use of the model. </p>

<p><em>Just sitting and enjoying listening to the conversation</em> is what I would be doing if the other dream interpretation models were first in the book. <em>After a while</em> symbolizes the later chapters of the proposed <em>Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models</em> book, which is where the PMID model was placed at the time of this dream.</p>

<p><em>Doesn’t seem to get it with only talking when I talk about thoughts</em> (PMID Step 2) shows that students need the steps explained and demonstrated to understand how to use the PMID model. When I <em>don’t feel hurried as I explain</em> demonstrates the best way to teach how to use the model is to explain each step thoroughly. However, if the PMID is in only two chapters there will be insufficient room for explanations and demonstrations. Further, with the PMID chapters last in the book, there will be insufficient time left in the semester for students to learn the model well enough to use it.</p>

<p><em>Almost to our destination</em> symbolizes almost to the end of the <em>Contemporary Dream Interpretation Models</em> book, which is where the PMID section was at the time of this dream. At the end of this dream, <em>I do feel pressed about being insufficient time to explain how to use the full PMID model</em>. Before this dream I didn’t feel pressed about the PMID being near the end of the book. </p>

<h2>How I used this Dream Guidance</h2>

<p>It seems my first dream of May 31, 2004, was talking about what I was planning to do at the time – update the textbook I wrote for the classes, BUT it was saying instead of just updating it, REWRITE it – write a completely new textbook for the PMID model. Stay in the house I love – the PMID model. Do NOT write a textbook in which the focus is other authors’ models.</p>

<p>Because of the third and fourth dreams, I moved the PMID model, including all six PMID model steps, to the front of the book and deleted the chapters about contemporary dream interpretation models. I followed Dana Bliss’s guidance for preparing the book for publication. It was published as <em><a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Counselors-Guide-for-Facilitating-the-Interpretation-of-Dreams-Family/Duesbury/p/book/9780415883429">The Counselor’s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams: Family and Other Relationship Systems Perspectives</a></em> by Routledge in 2011.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Many of us use dream dictionaries for finding meanings to one-word symbols. One-word symbol meanings can be helpful and fun to use, but there is also danger of taking dream dictionary meanings as absolute. Dream symbol meanings often vary depending on particular situations, and vary greatly from person to person, which is why understanding your own personal meanings for dream symbols is so important to interpreting your own dreams. </p>

<p>An important key in understanding your own dream symbolism and your personal meanings in dreams are what we call “symbol phrases” — learning the meanings of your symbols by examining the context beyond simple one-word objects. To understand the importance of symbol phrases just consider how often we use context in our waking life. Even a simple “Hello” can carry infinite meanings based on the event that precipitates this one-word greeting, the listener’s thoughts and attitudes about the person speaking, and so on. The same is just as true for dreams. </p>

<p>We will tell you more about symbol phrases later, but first a quick background of how we became co-researchers and how Evelyn became so deeply steeped in dreamwork that it led her to the six step Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID™) (1) that she teaches and we research today. </p>

<p>A dream about a “quiet Black man with an unshaven beard” led Evelyn to inquire of Bruce Bynum’s interest in helping research the PMID™ dream interpretation method. Dr. Bynum said yes. We now conduct ongoing projects with students; so you see our research is not limited to the experimental lab. Dreams accommodate to essentially any theory (2) and the PMID ™ dream interpretation method accommodates to essentially any type learning – especially self-facilitation. </p>

<p>Evelyn’s dream about a “many colored ‘dream’ cloth” over her shoulders (prompted by her husband’s question “Wonder if Ev’s dreams could be helpful to her”), gave her confidence to begin intense work with her dreams. In the process, Evelyn developed the PMID™ dream interpretation method. Although she was a highly rated accounting professor at the time, she followed her heart (and her dreams) into earning a counselor education masters degree to support her credibility for teaching dreamwork. Today teaching others how to interpret their own dreams is the “ loveliest and most fulfilling work I have done.” </p>

<p>Now back to explaining what symbol phrases are and how they greatly accelerate your understanding of your dream symbols.</p>

<h2>Awakening Personal Meanings with Symbol Phrases</h2>

<p>We have found the dreamer’s ability to bridge the gap from defining one-word symbols to defining the phrase that contains the symbol is very often a major key to capturing the “unique-to- theindividual meanings.” An example of a one-word symbol is door. One universal meaning of the word, door, is “opportunity.” An example of a symbol phrase is “I lock the car doors,” which one dreamer understood to mean, “I think I have to protect myself from danger without my husband with me ‘on the road of life.’” Another dreamer understood “I closed the door” to mean he had overcome a difficult relationship issue that was represented in his dream. </p>

<p>The phrase that contains the symbol helps the dreamer connect definitions to the context of the dream, the context being pre- dream events, pre-dream thoughts and experiences with people, places and objects. Selecting key symbol phrases is a judgment evaluation by the dreamer as to which dream phrases are the most personally meaningful. Dreamers’ spontaneous feelings are the best gages for knowing the relative accuracy of meanings she or he has developed. </p>

<p>Next are examples of symbol phrases that dreamers selected from their dreams. For purposes of these examples, we added words to the definitions to show dreamers’ connections to the context of their dreams. </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<p>“Decide to be friendly with person:” Way to overcome trace of stressful emotions about the person in this dream is to think friendly thoughts about her. (She was also implicated in a dream that I revisited last night.) </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<p>“Did not spend time with my friend Sara Emerson:” Reprimands me for skipping meditation yesterday after I decided my uninterrupted work was more important. Sara’s last name “Emerson” reflects my appreciation for Ralph Waldo Emerson’s philosophy to think from the highest perspective, something meditation helps me do. </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<p>“Does not want to hear what I have to say:” Be cautious about reminiscing in remorseful ways. In the dream, a childhood friend thinks I am going to talk about activities that she might have been involved in. Last night I almost went into talking remorsefully about this friend. </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<p>“I missed our very fine little girl friendship:” These words that I say to a childhood friend in the dream lets me know the true way I felt when my very fine childhood friend began preferring other friends.

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div> 

<p>“Lack of food:” Lack of food seemed to me to be saying I’m not getting enough emotional nourishment. All there was, was booze. I’m wondering where’s the meat (the substance). This ties to my last night’s worry thoughts about Victor’s alcohol consumption. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/">YourGuidingDreams.com</a> offers our <a href="http://www.yourguidingdreams.com/public/dreamscan.htm">DreamScan™</a> (latest technology to instantly finding meanings to one-word symbols), for use as “thought-starters.’ DreamScan™, free to visitors on the site, is fun to use, and many of those meanings reflect the context of the dream.. HOWEVER, the best way to find “unique-to-the-individual” meanings is to go beyond one-word symbols to defining symbol phrases. YourGuidingDreams.com gives instructions to members for defining symbol phrases. The Dreamwork Systems Perspective PMID™ step 6 uses a dreamwork systems approach to understanding dreams about relationships. A dreamwork systems approach is mindful of family systemic models, except, instead of the family or other major relationships coming together in personal counseling sessions, an individual studies series of dreams about various major relationships, primarily the family. (See the PMID™ steps in the box).</p>

<h2>Personalized Method for Interpretation Dreams (PMID™) Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your dream contents to current events and circumstances (most often, same day) to determine the context or theme of your dream. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your pre-dream thoughts (most often, same day) to your dream contents by treating the dream as a responsive answer to your pre-dream thoughts. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Develop your personal experienced-based definitions of dream symbol/symbol phrase meanings (or associations about) each dream character, place, object or circumstance. </p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Explore the emotions you felt during your dream. Compare to your waking emotions. Also, periodically compare to previous dreams for changes in emotions over time about a relationship or issue being studied. </p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Explore dream for possible suggestions of how to change thoughts, attitudes or behavior leading to understanding and reduction of key issues. </p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Who is the primary relationship in this dream? Comment on your dreaming reactions to/ relationship with any person(s) in this dream. Also, comment on whether this dream reflects current effects from past or recent experiences with another or others. If so, compare how you related/reacted in the past with your current reactions in similar circumstances. </p>

<p>To demonstrate the dreamwork systems perspective, we present a synopsis of Katharine’s series of dreams. After each of the first four dreams and interpretations, Evelyn gave feedback (through the instructor-facilitated university course) on Katharine’s PMID method use. Katharine interpreted her remaining dreams without facilitation. </p>

<p>To set the background for the primary relationship issues Katharine faced, we take a couple sentences from Katharine’s first dreamwork. “I have recurrent emotions of guilt and responsibility. I often feel like I need to keep everyone happy and not cause conflict, and that I must take on other people’s views on certain things.” Then, well into her work with dreams, Katharine wrote, “A common thread (in my dreams) seems to be that I am not responsible for other people’s feelings and I cannot carry that burden of feeling like I need to make people feel a certain way.” Dream series follows: </p>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream One: “Family Crash.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Katharine is driving, the whole family is in the car, she loses control and the car crashes. The night before the dream, Katherine felt guilty for letting her family down because she could not go with them to a football game.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Two: “Victorian Mansion.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Victorian vs. present day,” could symbolize being out of place… me caretaking my mom… which is out of place.” On one floor are children who “died at about age four.” “I can remember at a very young age, about four, being left at daycare, and being so upset that my mom was leaving, and wanting to cry, but not letting myself, because I knew that would make it hard for her to leave.” The night before this dream, Katharine worried about her mom’s “too quiet” attitude.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div> 

<h3>Dream Three: “Blocked Path.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Katharine is the only family member brave enough to leave the house to make a delivery to a neighbor.. Dead animals in her path (“possibly any negative emotions/ situations my family is unwilling to deal with”) prevent her from getting back to the family. The family watches with “we told you so” looks on their faces. “I feel guilty… and very alone… and scared.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Four: “Bullets.”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A roommate is shot. Katharine tries to stop the bleeding. The night before the dream, Katherine tried to stand up for a roommate who did not defend herself.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Five: “Going Back to High School”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A breakthrough dream. <em>Katharine gathers courage to give a dead cat back to a high school boyfriend after he leaves the dead cat in her locker. “As I walk back down the hall, I feel very relieved and freed.” The night before the dream the friend, now several years past high school, “pouted” when she declined a date with him, as he did during high school days. “I need to put Marshall’s childish behavior back on him and… refuse to carry around that worry.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div> 

<h3>Dream Six: “Painting in the Basement”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>-came one night after Katharine, for the first time, told a long-time friend, Paige, that she disapproved of Paige’s treatment of a young man. In the dream, <em>Katharine invites Paige to “paint in the basement.” Paige resists. “Me eventually going back upstairs:” “Represents me (Katharine) realizing I can’t force Paige to look deeper into herself….”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center">≈ ≈ ≈ ∞ ≈ ∞ ≈ ≈ ≈<span></span></div>

<h3>Dream Seven: “Nobody Believes Me”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a dream she had before the course, but was “too freaked out” to work with it, came again during the course). <em>Katharine first watches a sister bury a dead person in the back yard. Finally, Katharine comes out from “ Hiding behind a bush: My own fear of not knowing how to confront my sister” and “Stands next to my sister: This represents me confronting my sister, but also supporting her with this problem.” Before the dream, Katharine asked her parents to talk with this daughter about a disorder that seemed quite plain to Katharine. “They didn’t believe me.”</em> (They don’t believe her in the dream either.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>(Dreamer’s Summary):</strong> “Common with other dreams is the focus on me expressing myself more even if it is scary because I am not used to it. In “Family Crash,” I am in the driver’s seat, and in the “Blocked Path” dream, I am the one to be brave, and in “Nobody Believes Me,” I am the one to take charge and go stand by my sister. This message is very clear to me that I have the power to change things that I don’t like, even if I may not necessarily change how others respond. I can change my own actions, which does affect the system.” </p>

<p>A major aim for the PMID™ method is to help people in the current generation make healthful differences in their own lives, thus terminating potential unhealthful patterns. For several years, coauthor E. Bruce Bynum has suggested a “personalized” view of an extended familial system. In his explorations of dreams with individuals and with families in therapy, he has found people in close association, such as the family, resonate with each other in such a way that dreams of each family member express the family’s emotional situations. This shared matrix that exists within and between us, interlaces us all in an enfolding field, in a Family Unconscious. Though dreams of each family member reflect the family constellation, individual’s dreams differ, depending on the individual’s particular skew or perception of the family constellation and conflicts (4, 5). </p>

<p>Though we concentrate on relationship dreams, the PMID™ Method is equally useful for “everyday” guidance in common activities, such as home, work, recreation, career, education, and health. Simply eliminate PMID™ Step 6. Examples of what we call everyday dreams are the <a href="../bcpov6zprofe">two dreams published by Dream Network</a> (6).</p>

<p>It always fascinates me to hear other people’s stories about their work with dreams and Bobbie’s is no exception. <em>Notes from a Dreamer…on Dreaming</em> is a personal journey in dream interpretation towards self discovery and healing through dreamwork. </p>

<p>Like many people, Bobbie has been in a process of self discovery for much of her life. Yet through all her years of personal development, there was something else that kept making itself known to her through her dreams, something that called for her attention which ultimately catapulted her into a deeper exploration of her own unconscious. </p>

<p><em>Notes from a Dreamer…on Dreaming</em> reads like you’re having a very comfortable conversation with Bobbie about dreams and that personal feel makes for a very enjoyable and enlightening read. Bobbie uses many of her own dreams as examples to document her journey towards healing and also to share her style of dream interpretation giving the reader the sense that anyone can learn to interpret their own dreams.</p>

<p>Throughout her book, Bobbie shares many useful tips in working with your dreams, including things like dream recall techniques, keeping a dream journal, the creative influence in dreams, how to work with symbols, archetypes, people, colors, and how to take action on behalf of a dream. The book is decorated with Bobbie’s personal artwork and poetry making it visually engaging as well as engaging. She also shares many dream resources that readers can immediately access to get involved with by listing websites dedicated to the study of dreams.</p>

<p>Bobbie also includes a Symbol Dictionary with 76 common dream symbols to be used as a catalyst to get the reader started in working with their own imagery though not to be used as actual interpretations.</p>

<p>I deeply appreciated Bobbie’s passionate encouragement to readers to get to know their own dreams and imagery. Bobbie’s love of the dreamtime is apparent in every chapter of her book as she continually honors dreams for much of her personal growth and healing which may not have otherwise been accessed in the profound way that only dreams can provide.</p>

<p>Imagine my delight at discovering that my "theater of the night" also acts as a "light by day" as I teach university students. I have included two dreams in which I used that "light." </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-1.jpg" alt="Assignment dreams" width="300px" height="auto"></p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT of the DREAMS &amp; the DREAMER:</h2>

<p>My students tell me I require more work than most professors, but the most often repeated comment on student evaluations, is that I care about my students; I act as sort of "mom" role for them. Yet another role I assume is "coach". I use "coaching" language and techniques. Not surprisingly, one of the dreams included in this article reflects the coach role as well as the role of a mom. Quieting to me, though, is the clear message in both dreams, to me, to ease off - to stand back.</p>

<h2>SETTING OF THE FIRST DREAM:</h2>

<p>I assigned an ethics case for my principles of accounting classes. The case involved a graduating senior who had job interviews at two separate companies in the same city. Upon discovering he would be reimbursed for interviewing expenses, the student billed both companies for the <em>full</em> amount of his expenses. </p>

<p>In our brief class discussion, a couple students openly said they would have done the same thing; that is, take double reimbursement. However, later when I read the students' written responses to the ethics question, I was surprised to find the same comment made by <em>several</em> other students. I gave considerable thought of what to say to the classes for our next meeting. I finally had my talk prepared on how it is very important to be honest in coming to know oneself and so I appreciated the honesty in the responses. I planned then to lead into a discussion of the matter of treating others as one would like to be treated. I thought my plan was set. Then the following dream came in the early morning the day I planned to give my "little talk".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Don't Ask Your Students to Wash Their Dirty Laundry in Public</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><em>People are washing clothes in a laundry area of our apartment building. They brought the clothes up from the basement. I bring my clothes to wash also. A woman who was washing in the basement is now washing upstairs in this laundromat sort of area. A young man, probably a college student, is standing close to her and when he sees me, he says very loudly and possessively to me, "I'm next". I take my basket of clothes downstairs and talk very loud in mimic of the young man's "I'm next" as I go down the stairs. But when I get to the basement, I understand why these people aren't washing in the basement - either there aren't machines here now, or they aren't working. The upstairs is more like a laundromat, than the basement.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>[Oh, the 'washing your dirty clothes in public' dream is saying not to say anything about the students' ethics case answers in class. Several students said they would take the "double" reimbursement for interviewing trip.]</strong> (The bold type indicates the "aha" point which came just as I finished typing the dream.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The dream is saying my planned talk on the ethics case in class is like asking my students to "wash their dirty laundry in public." (Laundromat - a public place.) The matter is a personal matter and best handled at the subconscious level (the basement). Discussing the matter further in class is like asking my students to reveal in public what each can only decide for themselves. (Clothes are often symbolic of the personality.) </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zprofe-0.jpg" alt="clothing in public" width="400px" height="auto"></p>

<p>Assigning the ethics case provided an opportunity for each student to cleanse personality attitudes and emotions in the privacy of their subconscious level. However, my "appraisal" of the students responses would cause the students to bring their "cleansing work" to the mental level in defense of their attitudes and render the "washing machines in the basement" (use of subconscious mind) inoperable for improving understanding and cleansing attitudes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the dream seems to confirm what I had already said in class the day the case was assigned: We must live in consideration for others. Likely, the setting of the dream, in an apartment complex (several people involved), confirms the need for consideration of others. Likewise, the young man student who loudly and possess-ively tells me "I'm next" confirms his lack of consideration for others while watching out intensely for his own interests. </p>

<p>Notice, too, my own mimic of the student's "I'm next," which seems to point out by <strong>exaggeration</strong> that for me to <strong>repeat</strong> the students' comments about accepting the double reimbursement is certainly an unprofessional and unproductive method of dealing with the situation. Apparently my "dream counselor" is saying my "wellplanned" little talk would be a taunting insult to my students. </p>

<p>I believe the dream is further saying my planned talk wasn't from the my inner resources. (When I arrive in the basement - subconscious level - the washing machines are either not there or are inoperable.) Even though I gave the matter considerable thought I still didn't feel completely satisfied with what I planned to say. And, finally, notice I was also planning to wash my dirty clothes. </p>

<p>How I used my dream: When I went to class the day of the dream, I gave each student their copy of the textbook authors' comments on the ethics case and made a note to myself to assign the ethics cases from most of the chapters we will cover. But I did NOT give my planned "little talk."</p>

<h2>SETTING of the SECOND DREAM:</h2>

<p>I use a <em>team</em> approach in teaching an advanced auditing class where the class size ranges between twelve to fifteen students. We sit around oblong tables pulled together and act as an auditing team with me, the professor, as the partner-in-charge. This spring I purposely used only one table in order to bring the students in close eye-to-eye contact. </p>

<p>One of the hardest working students in the class was also the star of the university men's basketball team. The dream came in early morning the day there was major auditing case work due as well as an important basketball game that night. </p>

<p>About "gymnastics:" My husband often uses the word "gymnastics" in referring to frustration from excessive paperwork. </p>

<h2>THE GYMNASTICS AUDIT TEAM &amp; the COACH-MOM</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am an observer. There is a coach and young athletes - perhaps nine or ten. The coach is at the head of two parallel bars on which the young athletes are doing training. It seems like they are turning over the bars. The bars are two rows close together and the athletes are boys and girls. They are probably the same age, but the girls look more mature. At first I only notice the boys and one in particular. He is tired and thinks the coach is expecting too much. The boy says he has some injury and crawls between the bars toward the lady coach. She doesn't stop the practice, but keeps on going. The boy now does half-hearted turning over the bars. Now it is the end of the day's session and <strong>the boy quits the team!</strong> And now others quit the team and there are only six girls left; they don't complain. They seem to be willing to work. The coach is discouraged though. I believe she is wondering if there will be enough participants on the team for the next competition (but the dream is unclear on that point).</em></p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Now I seem like the coach</strong> and am standing just inside the door at the house of the boy who quit first. It is dusk-like in this modest room. The boy's mother is in the room. She is very discouraged about the boy quitting. She is very disappointed. She had high hopes of how well things were going. She knew he had something to overcome -fight back from something- but had thought her son was making progress.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>My interpretation of the dream:</em></strong> The parallel bars, so close together, is the setting for the auditing class. The arrangement of the young women and young men was basically the same as in the classroom with the young wo men on one side and the young men on the other side with the coach at the front end. </p>

<p>For the young athlete-scholar, the intense practice <strong>was</strong> his style except when the <em>"gymnastics" (unnecessary "paper work")</em> required of him as a student, coupled with the demands placed on him as an superior athlete, took more strength than he physically possessed. In the dream his "injury" portrays this. His crawling toward the coach shows his desperate need for relief. </p>

<p>The young man's mother (the mom in the professor) is concerned about him in a more compassionate and understanding way than the coach who has a greater interest in the team's being able to do well against competition than in the physical, emotional or mental well being of the gymnast-students. </p>

<p><strong><em>How I used the dream:</em></strong> I immediately cut back on the work assignments for the auditing class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I was moving back to the States</em> (I'm American but I live in Canada) <em>and wanted to say goodbye to Jeff, a man I worked with over ten years ago when I lived in Boston. He was sitting in a parked car, talking to another friend and I didn't want to disturb them, so I walked on. I started crying because I had not had a chance to say goodbye and I would soon be leaving.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Five days after I had this dream, Jeff was killed in the Kenya Air flight that crashed off the coast of Africa, killing all 169 people aboard. Coincidence? It could be, but I don't think so. I had not spoken to or dreamed about Jeff in many years. We had been congenial colleagues when we worked together, but we had not had a close relationship. If the dream was prophetic, why had it come to me? </p>

<p>I may never know the answer to this question, but this dream and other seemingly prophetic dreams suggest that when we sleep, we tap into a mysterious and profound universal wisdom. The dreamscape is a place where everything is possible and where the past, present, and future meet in the Now. </p>

<p>Of course, prophetic dreams do not become prophetic until we look back on them later. I could not have determined that the dream about Jeff was a harbinger of tragedy to come. And for every dream we have that speaks of things to come, we have probably thousands that speak only about our current inner dynamics. If I worried every time I dreamed of my separation from someone I cared about, I would be anxious indeed. </p>

<p>In her book <em>The Hidden Power of Dreams</em>, author Denise Linn says that any dream that allows us to look into the future, view the past, communicate with loved ones who have passed away, gain a vision, or enter into other dimensions is a 'seeing' dream. She says, "These special kinds of dreams expand your horizons into the realms beyond ordinary perception of reality. They allow you to reach below the surface of the human mind, to the place where the world is not made of separate parts but it is seamlessly joined in a rich tapestry of interrelatedness." </p>

<p>Jeff was only 43 years old when he died. He had a wife and two children. And what a kind-hearted man he was. But Linn's description of 'special' dreams encourages me to think that my dream was telling me that Jeff and I were in the process of moving to different dimensions of the Universe, to different 'states.' In the world of the limitless dreamscape, Jeff and I are still part of that rich tapestry of inter-relatedness.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>Henry Reed</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How did you first get interested in dreams? </p>

<p><strong><a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a>:</strong> I recorded my first dream in 1968, when I was a graduate student at UCLA. A student friend had inspired me with the dreams he shared with me. His dreams were different than what I was learning about in school. In my psychology classes dreams were seen primarily as medical samples to be used by professionals for the purpose of diagnosis. But my friend was having dreams that he used himself for inspiration and guiding his life. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Didn't you teach dreams in a university setting yourself?</p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Yes, in 1970, I began as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. I saw the possibility of combining dream research with a human potentials vision.My first dream project concerned a humanistically designed experiment to improve dream recall. The students and I explored what happens when people try to improve their memory for dreams. No one had ever tried that before, especially with a humanistic approach involving full disclosure and collaboration with the students, who were the participants in the study. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What did you learn about improving dream recall? Anything we can share with our readers? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> You can learn the ropes but not use them if you're not motivated to do so. We discovered that there is both a skill factor and an effort factor in dream recall. People can develop dream recall skills, such as lying still in the morning and writing down whatever comes to mind. But lacking proper motivation they won't spend much time using those skills. We published in 1974 our study in the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em>, showing that given special incentives people can demonstrate dream recall skills they had learned. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Did you do any work on dream interpretation in the university at that time? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> About the time I began teaching at Princeton, Fritz Perls was doing dream symbol dialogues at Esalen. His work would ultimately open up dream interpretation technology to the masses because he was the first person to practice a specific dream interpretation technique in public for all to see. We could experiment with his method and learn from it.</p>

<p>In my course on Carl Jung, for example, we married Fritz Perls' dialogue method to Jung's symbol amplification perspective. We would interview a dream symbol to learn its meaning.</p>

<p>Gayle Delaney, by the way, who has since become well known for her dream books, was a student in that class. She developed her "Dream Symbol Definition" method from our work in that course on Jung.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I know you spent some time at the Jung Institute in Zurich. How did that affect your work with dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It's hard to say. When I went to the C.G. Jung Dream Laboratory in Zurich, during a sabbatical from Princeton, I went there to work with Carl Meier, who had written about Asklepios, the Greek god of healing in dreams. But I was surprised at the mechanical approach he took to dreams in that lab. He had people sleep in a cold room to see if they would have more active dreams to warm the body. He had no conception of a humanistic approach to research. I wanted to help people incubate healing dreams. He was against it, so I came home and did it on my own. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> How did you do that? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> My dreams initiated me into recovery from alcoholism, so I had some personal experience about how they worked in that way (the story of this healing appears in my book, Getting Help from Dreams). I had also had a series of dreams that provided some of the details that I used to develop a dream incubation ritual. I wanted to do this work in a setting outside the laboratory and I got myself invited to the Edgar Cayce summer camp, where dreamwork was a regular part of the activities. I created a "dream tent" for people to sleep in. I asked them to decorate the tent with their dreams and I helped them to prepare for a special dream. </p>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zreedi-1.jpg" alt="Dream Tent" /></p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Did it work? Did people have special dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Did they ever! They had past life dreams, out of body dreams, things that I had never experienced myself. I was in awe of what was happening. Frankly, it was over my head. I was not spiritually awakened enough, or mature enough, to deal with what was going on. </p>

<p>I wrote an article about the work up to that date, and the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em> accepted it, in 1974, without any changes! That was flattering. But what I wrote enraged the faculty at Princeton. They terminated my contract, which was an unusual move, and caused some dissension in the department. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What got them so upset? They didn't like dream study? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It wasn't the content that upset them, it was my experimental method. I wrote in that article that if you wanted to obtain such dreams in psychology experiments, you couldn't conceive of dreams as being the result of a mechanical process. I proposed that we need to view dreams as an element in a storyline, involving an autonomous, transpersonal awareness, and that the best way to provide a context to develop that story line was using a symbolic ritual, not a mechanical technique. The folks at Princeton took that to mean that I was subverting the scientific process.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That must have been frustrating for you, especially if the Journal of Humanistic Psychology had been so enthusiastic about your paper to have published it unedited. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, I was terribly hurt, yes. But also, I felt overwhelmed by what was coming out of the dream tent, so I wanted to stop it anyway, until I could grow into it. That was back in the period of 1974-1976, and there wasn't the same climate of understanding and support as we have today for that kind of alternative reality. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Well, I'm sure the dream tent would be popular today. It suggests that dreams are a doorway to all the alternative consciousness manifestations people explore these days. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I felt that I helped open up a hole to the heavens, so to speak, so that divine energy could manifest in dreams once again. I was pleased when, in 1983, A psychiatrist named P. Richard Gunther, published an article in the American Journal of Psychotherapy, "Religious Dreaming: A viewpoint," in which he credited my dream incubation work with demonstrating that God was alive and well in dreams. But at the time--this was around 1974--I backed off that intense shamanistic relationship with people, and took more of a coach-like attitude. I let people create their own sacred space, create their own dream tent substitute at home--the personal dream diary. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You continued to research dream incubation, but in a different way? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Yes, exactly. The Edgar Cayce Foundation commissioned me to create a home-study research project on dreams. I was excited by the idea for two reasons. One, I got to develop the approach of conducting research with people in a humanistic manner by having them work on self-help projects at home. That approach has proven very effective, and in the years since, many others have adopted this synergistic approach to awakening consciousness through research. Also, I was interested in exploring Edgar Cayce's basic hypothesis about dream interpretation. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That sounds intriguing. What did he say about dreams? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It's not so much what he said about dreams, but about how to learn to interpret them. His basic idea was that it is easier to learn to interpret dreams if you have a reason to use them for something constructive. If you try to apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life, he proposed that dreams would respond to your efforts and help you learn to interpret them.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That sounds like the dreams would be active from their end to meet you half way if you would get off your duff and do something about your dream interpretation instead of just thinking about it. Is that the idea? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. Hugh Lynn Cayce, Edgar Cayce's son, is quoted as saying, "The best interpretation of a dream is one you apply." Just as <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a> developed safeguards so lay people could work together on their dreams, so Edgar Cayce had proposed a safeguard for individual dream work. It was testing a dream interpretation through application. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> So how did you implement that philosophy into your home study research project? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I created a "Dream Quest" workbook. It took the idea of the dream tent and spread it out over four weeks, with a weekly cycle of dream work. The adventure began by a person gathering dreams for a week while thinking about various areas of life that could be improved. Then I created some dream interpretation exercises that helped the person collaborate with their dreams to choose a project to work on, such as having more fun with the children, or getting along better with the boss, or improving personal morale. The exercise helped them to develop a strategy based upon their dream interpretations, then try it out for a week while recording more dreams. The second week's dream interpretation work focused on getting feedback from their dreams on the use of their strategy. From that work, they developed a revised strategy, and so on, continuing to look to dreams for new insights to apply and then getting feedback from the dreams about that application. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It sounds like it created the possibility for a relationship to dreams that would make for an ongoing drama. Did it work? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It sure did! At least for those who saw it through to the finish. There was a discipline involved. About one-third of the approximately 2000 people we enrolled finished the project. Most of them had very positive stories to tell. The dream interpretation exercises worked to provide applicable insights. Many people told about how they had made significant progress on their personal issues. I was very pleased. I published in 1978 a report on this work in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. It was the first study of its kind to demonstrate that it is possible for lay people, working on their own at home, to make constructive use of their dreams to improve their lives. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> The average person isn't sure that they can deal with their dreams, so your results seem pretty important for them to know about. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, yes, but even more important back then was what that study meant for the dreamwork movement itself. Prior to that, the usual comment from professionals, like psychologists and psychiatrists, was that it's best not to encourage people to look at their dreams because they are liable to stir up problems for themselves. Professionals are not so likely to say that today, and that's the result of changes brought about by the dreamwork movement. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I read somewhere you being called the "father" of the dreamwork movement. How did you get that title? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I don't think that I really have that title, but it comes from a passage in a book by Jack McGuire, one of the early participants in the Dream Network Bulletin. In his book on dreams, Night and Day, Jack describes my work creating the Sundance: The Community Dream Journal, and how it led to DNB. If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement--and actually there were many parents--it comes from the power of the press. The very existence of the Sundance journals, regardless of the content within them, spoke loudly about the birth of a movement. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Tell me about the Sundance journals. We've heard of them referred to often, but have never seen one. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, I guess they are collector's items among historically minded dream workers. It grew out of that home study project. People wanted more. I saw that people had stories to tell about how they had used their dreams. I had a series of dreams, a couple involving the word "Sundance" and related archetypal imagery involving the theme of "The Many and the One," suggesting that we could create a UNI-versity of dream students, sharing their explorations into dreams. So I created the journal just for that purpose. Before professional dreamworkers had any kind of forum for scientific exchange, the Sundance journals provided DREAMERS with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, to create a body of knowledge and expertise about dreamwork. The publication acknowledged that ordinary people can have a personal relationship with dreams and learn from one another's experiences. It is the equivalent of the public, scientific enterprise, but on a popular level. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Wow, I can see how that would help launch a movement, because it would empower people. The press has a lot of power to give the people a voice. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. And Sundance gave people a voice about dreams as being more than just a medical sample. Most of the things that professional dreamworkers explore today were first mentioned by ordinary dreamers in the Sundance journals. There were six issues, published from 1976-1978. They were subsidized by Atlantic University. When funding ran out, <a href="../@billstimson">Bill Stimson</a>, who was big fan, started up Dream Network Bulletin to carry the torch, the same torch you are carrying today. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Well, you carried the torch yourself, I know, because you were an editor of DNB for a couple of years, with <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Bob Van de Castle</a>, an enthusiast of dream telepathy. Didn't you develop some kind of dream telepathy experiment that emphasized community dreaming? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I did, and it probably is one of my dreamwork inventions that is going the strongest today. We call it the "dream helper ceremony." </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> We published an article or two about that ceremony in DNB. Tell us about it. How did it come about? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It was a serendipitous finding. When I had the dream tent up at camp, I noticed that often the kids in the camp would dream about the person sleeping in the tent. Sometimes it wouldn't be obvious to anyone but me, who knew about what the person in the tent was dealing with, so I could recognize the themes in the other kids' dreams. It seemed to me that here was a case of spontaneous dream ESP that was occurring on a regular basis, a rare bird in the ESP literature. I wanted to see if I could create an intentional experiment that would bring about the same results. I had had a dream of my own about the power of a circle of dreamers to guide me. I also worked with Bob Van de Castle because of his experience with dream telepathy, and together we created what we called the Dream Helper Ceremony. That's how it came about. To describe it, what you have in this ceremony, is that a group of people promise to dream about the undisclosed problem of a someone in distress. It's almost like a group of Good Samaritans, who offer help to a stranger in distress. Over a period of some twenty five years, myself and many other people who have tried this experiment have found it very successful. It's fitting, I suppose, that DNB has published accounts of it, but when Van de Castle and I submitted an article to the journal Dreaming, which is very concerned with its academic standing, they wouldn't publish it. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Why not? What are the results that are so controversial?</p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Well, the experiment began as a humanistic alternative to standard ESP experiments, so it has this parapsychological background. But the dream helper ceremony also stands on its own as a community dream process. Basically, what happens is this: No one dream usually seems very pertinent. But the group finds patterns in the dreams that enables them, usually, to correctly diagnose the person's problem, even though they never knew what it was until the experiment was over. Mark Thurston, who is now an Executive Director of the A.R.E., got his doctorate at Humanistic Psychology Institute, under <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner</a>, for his scientific study of that one finding in the dream helper ceremony. Some people will accept, and some people will not, that kind of evidence for ESP. But what I find more interesting is the more transpersonal dimension to the group dreaming process. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by transpersonal? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> It means finding something transcending the personal within the personal itself. In the dream helper ceremony, what we find is that the pattern of imagery in the dreams points the person's problem, but doesn't really provide any help to that person. The purpose of the ceremony is to help the person, remember, so we need to go farther. People question whether you can really dream for someone else, or if dreams have any external, objective value. Well, the answer we get is that if people will interpret their dreams for what they are learning about themselves, then their insights really do contain helpful advice for the person they were dreaming for. It is as if each person in the dream helper circle telepathically tuned in on the person's issue, saw it in terms of their own issues, and their dreams responded to the resonance by suggesting how the dreamer should work on his or her own related problem. That is the transpersonal element--each person found the distressed stranger within themselves. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> That seems to be a theme in dream groups. As in <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman's</a> dream process, where each member of the group can relate personally to the dreamer's dream. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. And in the Dream Helper Ceremony we have an alternative to the Ullman group method, not better and not a substitute, but an alternative way to have a group of lay people, even strangers to one another, work together constructively with their dreams. Today, many people who have experienced the dream helper ceremony go on to share it with others because of its power, even for the uninitiated. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by uninitiated? People who don't believe in dream telepathy? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I mean that you can take a group of people who have no prior dream experience, and, without trying to persuade them of any assertions about the value of dreams, the meaning of dreams, or anything other assertion about dreams, you can let them see for themselves. All you ask of them is this: Are you willing to keep a promise? Are you willing to lend a hand to someone here in our group who is confronting a life challenge and asks for your help? If so, then get a volunteer in the group, who doesn't say what their problem is, and have the people in the group promise to remember a dream for that person that night. That's all. I've done this experiment with Elderhostels, where you have senior citizens who haven't remembered a dream for ages. They can relate to the premise of the experiment. They doubt their ability to remember dreams, but remember them they do, because they've made a commitment. They don't think their dreams amount to much, but when I ask them to examine them in their group for common themes and come up with a diagnosis of the person's problem they were dreaming for, they do it and they surprise themselves at how accurate they are! They see that their dreams have value, that they contain helpful information. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It seems incredible that people can actually direct their dream to an invisible target. How do you think they do that? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> That's a good question, and has sent me off onto a new research direction. Several years ago I gave an invited address about the Dream Helper Ceremony to the annual convention of the Association for the Study of Dreams. Bob Van de Castle and I had conducted several workshop demonstrations of it at prior conventions, and now they wanted to hear from me about how it worked. As I was explaining in my talk, research psychologists have developed several high powered technologies to influence dream content in the laboratory--hypnosis, pre-sleep suggestion, sensory bombardment, and so on. It only works to a limited degree. Dreams seem to have a will of their own. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I think that's an important point. What makes dreams so valuable is that they have a mind of their own. They aren't just little stories that we crank out. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> Exactly. What I realized while I was up on the podium giving that talk, explaining this history of dream research, was that in the years that I had conducted Dream Helper Ceremonies, none of the participants had ever asked me, "how am I supposed to dream about someone else's problem, much less when I don't know even what it is?" It seems like such an obvious question, but no one had ever asked it. And, I realized, if they had asked it, I wouldn't have known how to tell them. It was like a mind-blowing light exploding in my head--we had never given them any instructions on how to do it, we never used a single technique. I realized that it was their intention to do so that carried the day. They simply did it intuitively. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> Dreams are pretty intuitive. We don't usually think of that fact, but they are one of are greatest living proofs that we are all intuitive. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> You're reading my mind. That's exactly the insight that came to me spontaneously while I was giving that talk. Afterwards, I decided to investigate how this intuitive communication between people in the Dream Helper Ceremony operated. It led me to the discovery of what I call the "Intuitive Heart." It relates to the idea that when we care about someone, our heart "goes out" to that person. In other words, we form an intuitive, empathic connection. The secret of dreaming, I believe, is that it is an empathic process. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> It seems so obvious when you say it like that, that dreams are a form of empathy. Does that affect how we should see dreams, or interpret them? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I think so. Rather than seeing dreams as containing hidden messages, see dreams as experiences of empathy. Then use empathy with the dream to reconnect with the experience of dreaming itself. I've been researching this process using a form of intuitive dream interpretation. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> What do you mean by "intuitive" dream interpretation? Doesn't all forms of dream interpretation employ intuition? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> In what you might call "analytic" dream interpretation, we look at the story line of the dream, or patterns, or symbols, or feelings. In other words, we begin by analyzing some feature of the dream by a standardized process to get a handle on the dream's meaning. In intuitive dream interpretation, we are looking for an immediate, holistic response to the dream. In the Bible, Joseph interpreted dreams and called it a gift from God. That suggests an intuitive response, direct from the unconscious. To explore this type of ability, I've tried having people get into a meditative state and hear the dream. Another approach is to read a dream to someone who is hypnotized. A really fun way to do it is to have people dance themselves dizzy, then respond to a dream--that works surprisingly well. </p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> I guess you help people get out of their minds, and then dream interpretation comes easier. </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> A dream occurs in a special state of consciousness and is the best expression of itself. So what state of consciousness do we need to be in, in order to be able to directly appreciate the dream? That is the quest of intuitive dream interpretation. </p>

<p>Most recently, I've explored something akin to dream divination as an approach to dream interpretation. Tarot readers, for example, will throw down cards and interpret a dream before they even know what it is. There's a big synchronicity element there, which of course pertains to intuition. The Mayans also do something similar, using a calendar divination to interpret your dream, again, before they even know what the dream is. These methods have something in common with the Dream Helper Ceremony, because in all cases, someone tries to help someone else by forming an intuitive empathy with that person's issue. So I created an experimental procedure I call Intuitive Heart™ Dream Story method. It goes like this: </p>

<p>Person A makes an intuitive heart connection with person B, who has a dream in mind. Person A allows a personal memory to spontaneously emerge in consciousness. Person A tells person B the story of that memory. Person A then begins to reflect upon that story as a teaching story: what does Person A have to learn from that story, what lesson does it contain. Afterwards, person B tells the dream and makes the connection with the story. The structure of this process grows directly out of the Dream Helper Ceremony. One person goes inside to get something personal, makes a lesson from it, and that lesson also feeds the other person. What makes it more interesting is that a dream itself is a story. A dream interpretation is a story about a story, and it is interesting to see how one person's personal story opens up another person's relationship to a dream. Here again we are seeing the community building aspect of dreams.</p>

<p><strong>DNJ:</strong> You are like a walking dream encyclopedia, Henry! I admire the creativity and spirituality that you have evolved and introduced into scientific circles as well as among every night dreamers. I'd like to tell a brief story. When I first started stewarding Dream Network Journal, one day I stood with hands on hips staring at a huge pile of 'nuts and bolts' work that needed attending. I was feeling a little disenchanted -- like the individual who achieves enlightenment and/or experiences nirvana and is then told to 'chop wood and carry water.' Just then, I heard, from behind my left shoulder, a chorus singing a phrase from one of Paul Winter's albums: "And great is your reward in Heaven!" That's all it took to energize me for the work at hand and it has sustained me ever since! I sing it now to you. Can we look at the dream story from a broader perspective? Hopefully, you can weave a response around this series of related questions: What impact do you perceive the Dream movement is having, culturally.... especially in Western culture? Are we, in fact, helping to raise consciousness, to bring about the changes that are so evidently needed? What changes have you perceived over the past 30 years? </p>

<p><strong>HR:</strong> I think the study of dreams introduces the transpersonal into the culture. Dreams have always expanded our understanding of reality by challenging our boundaries of the real, of the possible. One of the ways dream study impacts the culture, especially as we hear one another's dreams, is that we are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams. We hear our inner, subjective response to the outer world. That helps spiritualize our lives, which means in this context, to fight against the idea that we are just machines, that the universe is a mechanical process. Our dreams show us, and do so especially when dreamwork allows the people to hear one another's dreams, that we are spirit and are alive and well and paying attention. </p>

<p>The change I have seen, is that people are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another's dreams. It used to be that if you told a dream in public, someone had to make a joke to relieve the tension introduced by that alternative reality. The dreamwork movement has been helping to socialize people to respond in a more constructive way to hearing a dream. That ability to listen and respond to a dream in an accepting, open, way creates a path for the dream consciousness to enter our culture in a more significant manner.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i><a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a>, Dream Medicine, Lulu Press, 2011</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>The first time I encountered the work of <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a> I was immediately impressed. That was many years ago and I have been awaiting the time when he would again publish another book on his dreamwork. Now, that time has come. Henry’s new book, <em>Dream Medicine</em>, an expansion of his earlier book <em>Getting Help From Your Dreams</em> (1985), is a very interesting journey through his introduction and research into dreamwork in the 1960’s, at the beginning of what has been called the dream movement. In detail, Henry describes how his interest in dreams began and how they moved him forward into areas of dreamwork that had not yet been explored. Paying mindful attention not only his own dreams, but the dreams of others, Henry has established new ways to work with dreams which have enhanced the work and taken it to even deeper levels. What impressed me about <em>Dream Medicine</em> is the way in which Henry’s passion for the work has motivated new and innovative ways to work with dreams, not only for ourselves, but also for others.</p>

<p>This is not a book about dream interpretation, it is a book that encourages the dreamer to honor their dreams by being in a very different relationship to and with the images. Many chapters are devoted to a variety of ways in which to work with dreams, so, depending on what kind of involvement you find most appealing, you are sure to find new ways of working with your own dreams by using any one, or many, of these methods. I found the book to be insightful, fun, and easy to read, and although there is some repetition, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Henry adds a very personal touch to his book by adding in his own artwork to the pages which is a delightful way of continuing to add to the dimension of the dreamtime.</p>

<p><!--nopreview--><div style="text-align:center"><i>The Mastery of Love, first published January 1st 1999, 240 pp.</i></div><!--/nopreview--></p>

<p>Based on the Toltec tradition of the guidance of the fundamental three masteries, Don Miguel Ruiz guides us through the third of these which is the Mastery of Love. If we can master love, we master life itself. One anonymous reviewer on Amazon.com called this book “a courageous exploration of what it takes to experience being human in all its fullness,” and I completely agree. It cuts to the chase with simple easy language and clear and concise reasoning. This is not so much a book about dreams as it is a book about self love. </p>

<p>If you are not well versed in the notions of boundaries, projections and expectations, personal accountability, core shame and family of origin issues, and you’d rather not spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in therapy unraveling it all, then this easy to comprehend audio CD is a delightful alternative. It will show you how impossible it is to find love in another when you are unable to locate it internally. You come to understand how you began as a perfect being and how your emotional life developed from that point of perfection. It quickly becomes obvious that there is a choice to follow a path of suffering and pain in an endless, recurring cycle (the dream of hell), or to make a conscious choice to break that cycle, master the dream and live in happiness. The how and why of broken hopes and relationships, the simplicity of cause and effect become instantly clear with a first listening of the audio book, and somehow even more so with repeated play.</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6zssong-0.jpg" width="300" height="auto" alt="Bambi Corso"/></p>

<p>I have always been a lover of dreams, and I have always known that working with them would guide me throughout my life. At a young age, dreams became vital for my well being.  There was something about them that fed me, something that deep inside I knew was absolutely necessary for my own development and evolution. Thus, dreams became a practice in commitment, mindfulness, and trust.</p>

<p>As a child, there were three things that I was profoundly interested in. One of them was doctoring, and the others were reading and writing. In those days, I was fascinated with medicine, the idea of which was initiated by my mother who practiced holistic medicine and the power of the mind so we could heal ourselves. I was a very quiet child, so reading and writing were ideal forms of communication and therefore became my other big interests.</p>

<p>In my late teens, and far from the memories of my childhood interests, I began a 27-year career in the corporate world of administration and later executive management. Though this type of livelihood was stable and I learned a tremendous amount about business, it was unfulfilling and devoid of passion. I watched my dreams carefully as they pointed to high levels of creativity, meaning, soul and purpose. These dreams seemed to keep me going and kept me hopeful that the pull of my future would eventually find me. I had read a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes stating, “Most people go to their grave with their music still inside them”, and vowing to myself not to be one of them, began dreaming of searching for my song, my calling.</p>

<p>Throughout my years in the corporate world, I was often visited by images of fire, injured or angry animals, destruction and the lack of having a voice. These dreams, though disturbing and upsetting, encouraged me to work on myself, to begin to heal the areas of my own personality that were far from being whole and complete. My vacations were spent going to spiritual retreats with the goal of learning something else about myself that I could transform. It was obvious to me that I had to dig deep in order to find my strength, my confidence, and my voice.</p>

<p>As my life evolved, I was often visited by dreams of healing and the desire to make a difference. There was an overall sense of unseen forces at work in my life represented by images such as alchemy, guides, mysterious people or animals, finding treasures and themes of metaphysical elements at work. These dreams helped me to remember that I was not on my path alone, and that there was help coming from somewhere else.</p>

<p>In 1998 I was given my first song in a dream. <em>“I start this process of cleaning up and recycling, and eventually all the remaining people start to help too, and now we are all working together toward the same goal of cleaning up the Land. As we are doing this, I start hearing an Indian song, one I’ve never heard before and it just repeats over and over as we pick up the trash. Everyone works an area at a time like we’re a human machine picking up the trash in a herd type fashion. I notice some other people now showing up, dark people, but I don’t think anything of it as I continue to clean. But the song continues and more and more people show up and now I realize that they are hairy and naked, like old ancestral primitives and they are holding staffs. Still, I continue cleaning, but now they have encircled us at the top of this mountain area. I suddenly realize that these are the people of the Land! They never say a word, but they acknowledge what we are doing by showing themselves to us, which is so rare and such an honor, a reverence takes place between us. I see the looks in their eyes as they stand here proud and strong which is hard to explain. They are still living on the Land and watching over it. They are grateful. I hear a voice say, “Social Knowledge Keeps Us Both”, like living together in harmony, honoring one another for our lives and our differences.”</em> The idea of cleaning up the Land, became more a representation of cleaning up the emotional and spiritual land of people I would eventually work with. </p>

<p>Continuing to watch for indications of what I should do with my life, I dreamed that I myself would be doing dreamwork in a larger way when <em>“I am at a conference and Stephen asks me if I’ll introduce the next set of people, which I do, but then feel bad because I don’t know enough to say anything more than that about them, and I need to be better prepared.”</em> Based on this dream, the next night I attended a local Toastmasters meeting whose name was Rhetorical Link where two of the dream images were represented in physical form. The first was the name of the Toastmasters group represented as a family surname in the dream (Link), and the names Bob and Hope, which came up when the main presenter made the unsolicited comment that, “Well even Bob Hope says he still gets nervous every time he speaks.” I knew then and there that I was being guided to this place, and I spent the next two years learning the skill.</p>

<p>The next clue came in 2001 when I dream, <em>“It’s fascinating, for “Sound” is traveling between the two Poles, in an energetic way. I can see the night sky behind the poles and so there is a sense of vastness. These little tiny particles of sound travel between the poles, and then bounce off each other. The particles are together like a swarm of bees and travel the same kind of way, it looks the same, and so all these particles fly through the air and then hit one Pole, and as they hit, it sounds like a shattering of breaking glass, but then I can also hear voices and maybe some music for a moment as the particles actually touch the Pole. As soon as they hit one Pole, they start moving to the other Pole, and the same thing happens. I am just blown away by what I am seeing and so fascinated!”</em> Years later, I acknowledge that these poles were the first introduction of the Law of Attraction, and that Like attracts Like which would play a huge role in my soon to be career. </p>

<p>Then, one day after years of asking to be shown something more specific, a Law of Attraction Life Coaching opportunity presented itself and I knew intuitively that this was what I had been preparing for. As a Life Coach I could combine all my years of personal study and knowledge to create a healing business to empower people to transform their lives in a positive way.</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize that everything has its time. What’s important is that we begin the gestation period by first planting the seeds and then watering them little by little to allow them to grow into full bloom. For me, it was never just one dream that moved me onto my path, but the unfolding of a dream series called my life, in story… one night at a time.</p>

<p>I have since completed my Certification as a Law of Attraction Life Coach, and hold two certifications through the Pacifica Graduate Institute where I was trained by Dr. Stephen Aizenstat Ph.D. in his method of DreamTending. My Life Coaching business, <em>Living with Purpose… On Purpose</em> is a combination of life coaching, dreamwork, and a life’s worth of experience and spiritual practice. It is a direct result of following the guidance received in my dreams. I now inspire and guide people to do the same utilizing the Law of Attraction and the wisdom of their dreams which I also write articles about. Decades past my original interests, I now consider myself a healer of sorts, and get to enjoy the pleasures of reading and writing in a way that supports my calling.</p>

<p>I believe that similar to James Hillmans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman/#The_Soul.27s_Code">“Acorn Theory”</a>, we are all born with a sense of who we are to become already built within us. The guidance system that helps to reveal these gifts is that of dreams and intuitions, showing us where we feel our desires and our emotional responses allowing us to choose which direction will best serve us. Dreams help us navigate the waters of identifying who we are and what we truly want to be through their ability to move us emotionally, mentally, spiritually, physically and symbolically. When listened to deeply and given proper attention, dreams offer a highly calibrated guidance system designed to help us stay on track, correcting our direction by suggesting adjustments in our thinking, actions, decisions and relationships so that we can live the life we desire, the life of our dreams. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>In 2008, I had registered to participate in the International Association for the Study of Dreams online Psiberdreaming conference. I found myself hesitating before actually signing in and engaging, even after the conference had begun full swing. I had participated at previous conferences, even as a presenter, and felt comfortable in this community I had come to know since joining the IASD in 2000. I just couldn’t seem to get myself there this time though. Well, when in doubt, a little help from your dreaming friends can be just the ticket. </p>

<p>The conference connects dreamers from around the world and creates a container for sharing dreams over multiple time zones and across continents, within a two week period. We are talking non-stop dreaming. Well, in my experience, dreams don’t stop simply because we happen to be awake; dreams are beyond the boundaries of time and space. It makes sense that a gathering such as this, would create such a ripe environment for mutual dreams to occur. Rather than logging into the dream conference, I chose to log some zzz’s instead and slipped into my dreams. I soon found myself in the midst of a dream with several of my dream friends, who suddenly appeared inside my dream to come and wake me up.</p>

<h2>Entering the Dreamtime with the Rainbow Serpent</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Upon entering my dream, I immediately receive a visit from a dreaming friend from Australia, Kathy Turner, who said, “Come on Valley, wake up! Let’s go!” I could see she is connected to a red cord of light and there are 3 other women also coming with us, each connected by their own colorful cord of light. Now inside a conscious dream reality, I see another dreaming friend, Teresa MacColl. She appears in my dream and approaches an ancient tree that has been hollowed out; it holds rainwater and she is lying inside it. I then find myself speaking with an older, full-bodied woman with skin the color of the dark earth. This African looking Medicine Woman offers me a glass vial of a flower remedy that she has made. I decline her offer because I do not know her. She grimaces at my choice, shaking her head. I then find myself in a circle of women gathered together in the dark of night, all wearing dark hooded garments. Each holds a large orb of light in front of them, showing their sacred light.</em> </p>
  
  <p><em>These women are healers, gathered together, as from a distant ancient memory. It is the light they each hold, which identifi es them as a member of this sacred circle of women healers, each with their own gifts and wisdom. I then began to hear music playing and see three aboriginal men bringing their song lines to me, offering their sacred song, to take me into the dreamtime. I find myself entering the dreamtime where the world is formed in dreaming. My consciousness is spread out through the stars in the galaxy and there swims the giant and beautiful Rainbow Serpent of Aborigine creation myths. The dream brings me into contact with this beautiful energy in a cosmic dance of the heart. The dance weaves back and forth, undulating into my heart and back out to the expansive beauty of the galaxy and the Rainbow Serpent.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day, my dream was vivid in heart, my body and my mind. I was conscious through most of the night in my dreaming adventures. I realized I really wanted to share my experience with my dreaming friends who came to meet up with me in my dreams. When I finally arrived at the conference and shared my dream, I found there was a Telepathy Dreaming Contest going on. Everyone was sharing the dreams they had focused on the previous night with the intention of connecting with an undisclosed dreaming target. </p>

<p>I decided to share my dreams there, even though I had not consciously made the intention to participate in the contest. Not long after sharing my dream, I received a nudge from my friend Joy. She also did not participate consciously in the contest, but submitted her dreams anyway. In the process of reading through the dreams submitted, she noticed strong mutual dream connections with me and another dreamer.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I come upon 2 large-trunked reddish-brown-barked trees that the path goes between…. I thought/ said “Aha! 2 redwood trees”</em> (in fact the bark was scaled, not shaggy) <em>…I decide to climb… and arrive in a big nest-like, rounded-out platform/hollow made by the junction of wide sub-trunks</em> [very thick branches], <em>worn smooth</em> (aware this was more oak-like than redwood-like) <em>… I ask myself “Now what shall I do here? - Oh yes, heal my uterus, or see what’s within it!” A shaman-like woman is before me then, waiting there in the high tree hollow, and I make this arrangement with her: If I do not succeed at this, then she will destroy me…. I decide it can only be a destruction of current ego patterns.... “Okay, destroy me!”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Val Bigelow:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I see a very thick, large tree trunk or the bottom of a tree with some branches intact and some cut off</em> (not a lot of leaves to be seen just THICK BRANCHES.) Last segment… <em>A girl is sitting up in a large tree</em> (similar to the first tree dream) <em>with a white top on and dark blue skirt or jeans. She may be turning down a proposal</em> (of marriage?) <em>but I can’t see the person she is turning down.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Valley Reed:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Teresa MacColl appears in my dream and approaches an ancient tree that has been hollowed out; it holds rainwater and she is lying inside it. An African-looking Medicine Woman offers me a glass vial of a flower remedy that she has made. I decline her offer because I do not know her.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we all agreed these were very strong mutual dreaming connections. The conversation continued and the connections expanded to impact more dreamers. What eventually became of this mutual dream for me, is not so much that we experienced one together—although powerful in its own right—but that there was a deeper message here for me. Our dreams seemed to bring us the potential to dream together for the purpose of healing in connection with the divine feminine, the earth, the sacred tree and each other. I had experienced the power of mutual dreaming in a conscious dream state that drew me into the dreamtime… a place where we can dream the world into being. I felt inspired by this, so expanded on the energy of our mutual dream by creating the dream tree healers group. This online group of women dreamers has been ongoing since 2008, when we discovered our mutual dream. Together, we have gathered, shining our light in rhythm with the moon and the seasonal turnings of the wheel. We planted the dream tree, where the roots reach deep into dreaming, while her branches stretch out into the brightest reaches of the universe, so that together we may dream strong, with a little help from our friends. ∞</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Let’s assume for a moment that Life is a dream. This means that we can use dream techniques on waking life events or situations. Go ahead. Try it: </p>

<p>Pick something from your everyday, waking life — say, an unexpected change in your job, or that near-miss on the freeway, or perhaps an emotionally charged encounter with someone — and take a step back to look at that event or situation ‘as if’ it were a dream or a scene from a dream. Apply your favorite dream tech-nique(s) to this event or situation. What do you notice? Now take another unusual waking life event or situation and look at that as if it were a dream. Now look at any waking life event or situation as if it were a dream. </p>

<p>How does the dream world show up in your waking life? </p>

<p>How do you know that you are NOT dreaming, right now? </p>

<p>When we work with our dreams, we have tools to enhance our everyday life—and to explore this dream we call ‘waking life’. </p>

<p>How do you work with dreams? What are your favorite techniques? However you look at dreams, use those tools to look at waking life. See the people, places, actions, emotions, etc. in a waking life event or situation as if it were a dream event or dream fragment. What do you notice? What do you see? What do you learn about yourself in this exercise? What do you learn about your relationship(s)? Your body? Your job? Your life’s calling? Your choices? </p>

<p>In the 1980’s, I spent hours each day/ week recording dreams and working with the dream tools and techniques I was learning. I incubated dream questions, intended lucid dream experiences, wrote about my dreams, read dream books, etc. In short, I immersed myself in the world of dreams and dove deep with the intention of dissolving the culturally-constructed barrier between waking life and dreaming life. Somewhere in all this dreamwork, I began to intentionally look at unusual or out of the ordinary waking life events and situations: a child’s doll, lost/discarded along a wet curb; an argument with a co-worker; found money; odd objects that caught my attention for some reason. What happened ‘woke me up’ more than I expected! </p>

<p>As anyone who works with dreams knows, the more attention one pays to dreams, the more detailed and vivid they can become. Coupled with a desire to become lucid while awake in consensus reality, this intensive dreamwork began to thin the veil between worlds. My waking life became richer and spoke to me in surprising and personally meaningful ways. My dream life became more alive. Using several methods to remind myself that I was dreaming (while sleeping and while awake), the pre-lucid and lucid dreams became more frequent. Then, one day, the dream-world appeared in waking-life reality—I literally walked into a recurring dream-image! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>That day I went to a particular room I had been to several times before. Nothing was out of the ordinary on ‘this side’ of the door (no signs or announcements). However, when I opened the door, the room was obviously in the midst of significant remodeling— spaces that were normally private were completely exposed (!).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This room, this image, came from dreamtime and said, very clearly, <em>‘waking and dreaming are one.’</em> The world shifted, expanded, and I knew that if I crossed the thresh-hold and entered that room my life would not— could not—be the same. I wish I could say I eagerly stepped into the room. What I discovered instead was a strong attachment to my ‘ordinary’ (albeit uncomfortable) life. In that room, anything/everything was possible... but required more than I was willing to give up. I closed the door without entering the room. </p>

<p>Then the circumstances of my life began to change, leaving less time for intensive dreamwork. I was still connected to my dreams, however, and started my first dream group around that time. </p>

<p>I never quite let go of looking at waking life events and situations ‘as if’ they were dreams. One eye stayed open for dream images in waking life. I still draw on these concepts in dream groups and workshops. Sometimes I look back on that day, that choice, with the wistfulness of wishing I had been ‘braver’ at the time. Change continued, as it does, in steps large and small. Something profound had touched me, and although my life seemed safely ‘ordinary,’ my interest in non-ordinary reality and dreams gave it an unusual flavor. Now, years later, I seek again something like that room, to enter and take that leap, to consciously cross the thresh-hold, and actively embrace a non-ordinary life in which ‘waking and dreaming are one.’ </p>

<p>Sometimes waking-life dreams are personal, circumstances surrounding a sudden head-dive and broken finger, for example. Even in the emergency room, I joked/talked with my friend, “If this were a dream, what would it be telling me?” Sometimes a waking dream includes others, as when several of us headed out of town to meet with another dreamworker, the driver had car trouble that stopped us in our tracks. The part(s) that failed held significance on several levels. And sometimes a waking dream is part of the collective psyche, as with Sept. 11 or hurricane Katrina. </p>

<p>Viewing the events and situations of waking life ‘as if’ they are dreams allows another, larger, dimension to open in our personal/collective world. We are not as separate from ourselves or from each other as some would have us believe. We are not alone and are not powerless in the face of disaster or tragedy. It is possible to see more of one’s self, and the world, with the help of these ‘waking dreams.’ Working with waking life events as dreams can help each of us become more conscious in our lives. As each person becomes more conscious (in interactions, choices, etc.), the world (and the world view) will, of necessity, change. </p>

<p>We are all connected. Life is a dream – a great big, collective, group dream. Let us wake up in our dreaming life. Let us wake up in our waking life. </p>

<p>Let us become conscious. Emerge from the cocoon. Let’s wake up. ℘</p>

    ns1:description """<p><img src="../images/post_bcpov6zwater_0.jpg" alt="Dream collage" /></p>

<p>In looking at my dreams, I often see reflections of my negative actions, thoughts, and feelings. By examining them closely and being completely honest with myself, I’ve come to discover who I am, why I am who I am, and more importantly, who I am meant to be. This is an ongoing and continuing process; I am forever changing for the better, which is also reflected in my dreams. This became evident a few months ago when I had a dream that I titled, “Another Tidal Wave,” which reminded me of a previously recurring dream titled, “Water, Water Everywhere.” A comparison of the two was very revealing. </p>

<h3>Water, Water Everywhere</h3>

<p><em>I am at the beach, alone. I savor the peace and quiet as the warm surf rolls under my feet tugging gently at my ankles. Suddenly, the water is up to my knees and I find it difficult to walk. I head for shore and I am scared. The shore gets further and further away and the water gets higher and higher.</em> </p>

<p><em>I see a building in the distance and I know that I must reach it or I will drown. My heart pounds in my chest, as the water continues to get higher and higher. I find myself at the door of the building. I look behind me; the water is about to overtake me. I open the door and make it inside. I know that I am safe.</em> </p>

<p>I look around; the building is empty. I go to a small window and see the water is above the window line. The building is submerged in water, yet I feel safe. The above was a recurring dream I had for over 20 years, starting when I was about 12 years old. It was always the same for many years. At some point, I began to notice a few (one at first, then two or three) other people in the building. When I was about thirty-two years old or so, the window seemed to get larger and larger -- until the walls were literally made of glass, at which point the dreams stopped. I have not had this dream for over fifteen years now. </p>

<p>To understand the interpretation, you should know that there were several incidents in my adolescence that I repressed -- in other words, locked away deep in my unconscious. </p>

<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The Ocean signifies that the dream is referring to my unconscious. The water is overtaking me and I am afraid that unless I go inside the building, I will drown. If the water symbolizes my emotions, then the fear of drowning indicates that I was afraid that my emotions would overwhelm me. Therefore, I needed to find shelter from these emotions and went inside the building —inside of myself. </p>

<p>At first, I was alone in the building. At some point, I became aware of other people. These other “people” were actually me. For each repressed incident that occurred in my life, another part of “me” went “inside” where it was safe. </p>

<p>The window allowed me a glimpse of the emotions (the “water”) that I was afraid of. In the beginning, the window was very small, and seeing the water going over the top of it, reinforced my belief that going inside the shelter was the right thing to do--it saved me. The window got larger and larger as I matured and learned how to deal with these emotions that I repressed for so long. In the end, the walls were completely transparent. I no longer needed to hide in the building, as I was no longer afraid of drowning in my emotions. So, the dreams stopped. </p>

<h3>Another Tidal Wave</h3>

<div class="media-item resp-container"><iframe class="resp-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EilI5nTha6M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><em>I am on a balcony overlooking a beach. I know that I am not alone. To my left is my “guide” and to my right, I sense two or three women, though I do not see them. Out on the beach I see several people walking. I look out to the ocean and see a huge tidal wave approaching the shore. I start yelling at the people on the beach to run for safety. Then I see a baby on the edge of the surf, alone. I point to the baby and yell at the people to, “Save the baby, save the baby!” Everyone runs off and leaves the baby on the shore alone with the tidal wave getting closer.</em> </p>

<p><em>The scene shifts slightly. Now I am on the balcony with these same women and my guide, only we are completely underwater, though I am not afraid. I see a scorpion drift by. One of the “women” warns me to be careful as it might sting, but I am drawn to the scorpion and reach out my hand to touch it. It stings me on my palm. I look at my palm, but it doesn’t hurt. I know that I will be OK. The scene shifts again. We have moved inside and I hear a Special News Bulletin on the TV. The announcer is saying, “Tidal wave hits beach, baby dies.”</em> I wake up. </p>

<p><strong>The Interpretation:</strong> The similarities to my earlier, recurring Water, Water Everywhere dream are apparent; however there are significant differences. While the beach, ocean and the impending wave are similar and symbolize the same things, my viewpoint, or perspective, is different. In the original dream, I am on the beach and the danger is imminent. In the new dream, I am able to view the impending tidal wave from a higher, safer perspective--a clear sign to me of personal growth. In the original dream, I must seek shelter, or hide. Here, I feel no need to run or hide. Also, in the original dream, I am inside the building with the water all around, while in the more recent one, I remain outside on a balcony, outside of myself (the building); and even when the water overtakes me, I am unafraid and I know I am not alone. The scorpion stings me but I am not hurt. </p>

<p>It so happens that my partner in life and dreams, <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Bob Van de Castle</a>, is a Scorpio. I know he will not hurt me – and no matter what emotional upheaval occurs, he will be there and I know I will be OK.</p>

<p>The announcement that the baby dies might seem, at first, to be negative or dangerous, but (if the baby signifies an immature part of me, then the baby <em>dying</em> means that this part of me has matured, or I am no longer in need of it. The baby has died and in its place is a mature woman ready to accept and deal with whatever comes -- and I am not alone. </p>

<p>It was only in comparing the recent dream to the older dream that I was able to completely understand and appreciate how far I have come over the years. I am grateful for my dreams and the messages they provide. I know I am on the right path. ∞</p>

<p>Dance has the power to manifest the unconscious visibly through the physical shapes the dancers make and the movement patterns that they trace through space. The imagery that the dance stirs up in the mind’s eye engages the audience’s imagination. “Dreams never lie,’” C.G. Jung assures us. Gabrielle Roth asserts, “The body never lies.” Therefore, a dream dance has the potential to express a very primal truth. </p>

<p>I teach dance at a small, private liberal arts college where I am Artistic Director of the Berry College Dance Troupe. We present an annual dance concert for which I develop original dances. For the 2002 concert entitled, ‘Wishes, Lies, and Dreams,’ I created a dream dance as a way of working with the dream material that was bubbling up to consciousness for me. </p>

<p>For years, I have recorded every dream that awakened me from sleep. These dreams were often intensely gripping nightmares that demanded my immediate attention. I have also done stream-of-consciousness journaling in which much of my dream material arises. </p>

<h2>When Last I Dreamed</h2>

<p>When I began working on this dream dance, my students found this way of honoring dreams fascinating. I brought in passages from Jung and John Sanford to give them a deeper perspective on how I was transforming the dreams into choreography. Before I began teaching a dance phrase, I would read the dream to them that we were about to enact. I wanted the dancers to understand the motivation behind the movement. Sometimes the dream would speak to one of the dancers personally and he/she would literally jump at the chance to portray the protagonist. </p>

<p>‘When Last I Dreamed’ provided the opportunity to embody my dreams. It recreated the visions I had seen in my sleep. Although I did a great deal of research into dream symbolism, my goal was to delve into the feeling state that came up in the dream, rather than analyzing the meaning of the dream. I also explored active imagination as a way of finishing a dream or to further develop dream material. </p>

<h2>Opening</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grcdan-1.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>‘When Last I Dreamed’ opened in relative stillness. The audience was invited into the dreamscape, which included the outline of a two-story Tudor style home with twin dormers, a huge birdcage, and a pedestal. The two male dancers and six female dancers were costumed in fluid silk pants and short-sleeved shirts in pale tones, reminiscent of pajamas. </p>

<h2>Angels</h2>

<p>The first dream sequence re-enacted Jacob’s classic dream from the Old Testament, wherein a ladder connecting heaven and earth appeared, with angels flowing up and down the rungs. In this angelic dance, the female dancers entered sequentially and began turning. The Dervish-like spinning invoked a sense of relinquishing control, of surrendering to the Divine. Next, pairs and single dancers ‘took flight,’ in the form of running leaps, as well as male-assisted lifts. So, the opening dream sequence created a sense of Divine presence in the dream dance. </p>

<h2>Man with a Gun</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grcdan-2.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>The next section of the dance depicted scenes from nightmares. My first disturbing dream reported: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am at the home of my childhood, even though I am a young mother. I am facing our green front door, surrounded by ivy wallpaper. I can see a man that I recognize on the other side of the door, a man with whom I was once very much in love. Now, however, the sight of this man holding a gun outside my front door is extremely threatening. I panic as I realize that my parents have never locked their doors, in fact, none of their doors or windows lock. I feel extremely vulnerable. My heart is pounding. I know that there is no way of keeping this man at bay. Somehow, I muster the courage to shove the front door open and he falls into an abyss with his gun falling after him.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This dark dream unfolded as a dance phrase in which a young woman seemed to be panicking and running from room to room inside the Tudor house. A large man with a gun crept up to the house and paced back and forth in front of the window. He peered inside at her. The female recognized him, but only responded to him as a threat to her security. The tension mounted, as harsh music grew more intense, until she finally fainted and he ran off stage. </p>

<h2>Two Women</h2>

<p>The second section of the dark dreams involved two female dancers who performed a frantic dance to discordant music. Their movements were harsh, angular, and staccato. Their arm gestures slashed out into space. They fell to the floor. Their bodies exploded open. They contracted violently closed. It was a dance of possession. It brought up images of the medieval Tarantella, in which women reportedly danced out of control until they passed out or died. </p>

<h2>Falling</h2>

<p>After we had been building the dance for several weeks, I asked all the dancers, “What dreams do you have that we are not portraying?” “Falling dreams!” was the resounding response. So, we immediately began to recreate their dream experiences. Three of the tiniest dancers agreed to be the fallers. They each mounted the pedestal and one after another fell backwards into the arms of the other dancers, who then eased each to the floor. This added interest to the dance and the collaboration gave everyone a sense of ownership in the creative process. Then our 6’ 6” former collegiate baseball player shared his idea: “I always dream that I’m falling face first. I’d like to try doing that.” Everyone froze! He outweighed most of our dancers by over one hundred pounds! Still, everyone agreed to let him have his turn falling, very aware of how much force would have to be absorbed to keep him safe. When it was his turn, he didn’t just fall passively into their arms; he sprung off the pedestal like he was diving into a swimming pool! The studio echoed with the slapping sound of twelve hands breaking his fall. Although it was a very stressful scene, it stayed in the choreography. Every run of the show, his fall brought gasps, as members of the audience revisited their worst falling dreams. </p>

<h2>Birdcage</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grcdan-3.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>The next dreamscape involved a human-sized Victorian birdcage. This metaphor grew out of dream imagery in which I reported: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I feel like I’m suffocating, gasping for air or caged as a wild animal, having always known sweet freedom. In other dream imagery a beautiful bird often appeared in a gilded cage.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My research suggested that birds often symbolize the soul, as a creature of both the earth and the sky. The image of a cage suggested the restriction of an instinctive aspect of the self. A caged bird reportedly served as a metaphor for frustrated spiritual ambitions. </p>

<p>To depict the essence of the caged bird, a stark white light illuminated the cage. A single female dancer gripped the bars with both hands and peered out. As the dissident music built to a climax, she kicked and swung her legs about the limited space, but froze all activity to watch another female dancer ‘fly’ past the cage as two men lifted her. </p>

<h2>The Dream Lover’s Dance</h2>

<p>The caged dancer remained confined, as four other female dancers joined her on stage, along with a tall male. The man relaxed on the pedestal and watched as his Anima or dream lover dance unfolded. The four women on stage moved sensuously, with gestures that communicated longing and desire. The caged dancer joined their dance in her confined space; her arms reached out of the bars, beseechingly. When this dream concluded, all of the characters exited the stage, including she who had been contained in the birdcage. </p>

<h2>Snake Goddess</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grcdan-4.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/></p>

<p>The snake dance grew out of a specific dream I had: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‘There are snakes everywhere, venomous snakes. I witness this scene, but do not physically interact. My beautiful middle daughter and her father are rallying these snakes into the center of the space between the two of them. In pairs, the snakes merge and wrap around each other and rise upward. However, they begin devouring one another instead. As the energy changes, the young woman becomes less cautious in the way she is handling the snakes. Just as she drops two snakes on the ground and they escape between her feet and legs, I speak. “Do not allow those snakes to run between your legs. They could bite your ankle or slide up your leg.” Just then, she grips another snake close to the tail and lifts it toward herself. The snake slings itself against her torso and ascends her body, biting her neck as it slides under her hair. ”I am bitten,” she announces simply, releasing her grasp on the snake.’</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many ways to work with this dream. I chose to focus on the transformative symbol of the snake, with its ability to shed its skin and start life anew in another manifestation. I was also aware of the medical symbol inherent in the entwined rising snakes as I continued my research. Death in dreams reportedly symbolized another form of transformation, from one life experience to the next. So, I worked with this dream dance phrase by focusing all the transformative energy on the central female. She undergoes metamorphosis into the Snake Goddess of early Cretan culture. </p>

<p>As I recreated the snake dream, I opened the scene with a beautiful young woman dancing into center stage with a 6-foot snake wrapped around her shoulders like a shawl. Her undulating solo portrayed snake-like sensuality. She commanded the stage with her powerful presence and took on the persona of the Snake Goddess. Then, pairs of women entered from opposite sides of the stage, each with a snake held between her hands. After encircling the Snake Goddess, each draped her snake on the outstretched arms of the Goddess and exited, as another pair of dancers entered holding their snakes. This continued until the Snake Goddess was laden with snakes undulating all over her upper torso. At this point, two men advanced toward her, presenting a throne upon which she sat, balancing all of her snakes, and they carried her offstage. </p>

<h2>Ending</h2>

<p><img src="../images/post-bcpov6grcdan-5.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/> </p>

<p>‘When Last I Danced’ concluded by revisiting the still point imagery with which it began. Dancers were joined in pairs and trios, mirroring one another or mutually supporting the other in shapes that challenged their balance and level of trust. Each image that emerged out of their bodies blending and entwining offered a gateway to the audience’s own fantasies, with a final group sculpture depicting diversity within wholeness. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This choreography was my creative response to delving into the realm of my own dreams, knowing that there was nowhere to hide. ‘When Last I Dreamed’ evolved in collaboration with my student dancers. Without their willingness to take dreams seriously, I could never have taken the risks involved in telling the world what I least understand about myself! </p>

<p>My career started as a photojournalist for a weekly town newspaper. My style has evolved to include nature, dreamscapes, landscapes, and travel &amp; tourism. I’ve been awarded grants and won awards for my imagery, and have exhibited on both coasts of the United States.</p>

<p><em>Photography Then–</em> My first “real job” was at a local newspaper in my hometown. After talking with the editor, he gave me a few photo assignments on a trial basis. A month into this new photojournalist position, I had my first of many front page photos.  It meant lugging 50 pounds of camera equipment through seventeen local communities on assignment for human interest and breaking news stories (and through all types of crazy New England weather, too!) I stayed with the newspaper for 7 years before enrolling in computer training school.</p>

<p>My formal art training at Rhode Island School of Design included alternative photographic processes and design.</p>

<p><em>Photography Now –</em> I have been exploring the links between art, visual therapy, and the realities of the dream state for many years. My work, while being a deeply personal exploration of my own dreams, jars the viewer with its beauty of light interplay, form, and design. Its my intention to create a tactile beauty that brings viewers into my private world while simultaneously giving one the permission to touch, feel, and experience each piece, while making it part of his/her own world, language, and life.</p>

<p>I take a very “Zen” / organic approach in creating recognizable images that strike a resonate chord. My approach to making photos is a quietly hidden metaphor for the ever changing fluidity of our dreams and frailty of beauty. A haunting reminder of how both shimmer before us, but can disappear in the blink of an eye. An eternal aide memoir that everything is not always as it appears to be.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>"Just when you thought nothing new could be written about dreams, Janice Baylis has applied chaos theory and complexity theory to dream interpretation. Her suggestions are grounded in cutting edge paradigms." <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stanley Krippner, PhD.</a> Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University</p>

<p>How I, Janice Baylis, got interested in dreams: In 1959 a fellow teacher had major surgery. We set up a car pool where I picked her up in a strip mall parking lot and drove the 30 miles to our school.  One morning Mabel phoned and asked me to meet her around the corner on the residential street.  She said she didn't like her car taking up space in the store lot all day. I said, "Okay."</p>

<p>As Mabel was getting into my car that morning, we heard an enormous CRASH!  A small airplane had landed upside down in the corner of the parking lot where we would have been.  Then she told me she had dreamed it during the night. "WOW!" exclaimed my eight year old son, Brad, from the backseat.</p>

<p>That launched me on a life-long, self-directed and academic study of dreams. From the first, the practical side of dreaming has been my focus.  The Edgar Cayce dream material was the first I found to study.  He also emphasized the practical aspects--health, finances, job, creativity, and interpersonal, as well as the personality growth and spiritual aspects.</p>

<p>With my BA degree in Education and a MA degree in Psychology, I got a credential/license to teach dream-study at the community college level.  I taught 36 hour, semester, night classes and weekend workshops.  My students urged me to write a book, so I wrote Sleep On It! The Practical Side of Dreaming in 1977. </p>

<p>In my teaching I found many dreams use overt sexual imagery and that people were confused by the symbolism of sexual images.  I made this a secondary focus of my dream work.</p>

<p>My earliest memories include dreams and my fascination was intensified by sharing a mutual dream with my sister at the age of 11. Psi dreaming has seemed natural ever since; lucid dreaming comes easily; and I especially enjoy exploring the potential of lucid psi. I love inspiring others to expand the horizons of their dream worlds and above all I treasure the incidents that reveal our ultimate connectedness. It's been my hope since that first mutual dream that science would advance beyond its hesitancy to acknowledge, let alone explore, that which isn't readily replicable and measurable with current technology.</p>

<p>I'm a psychologist and graduate of the University of Barcelona. After finishing my degree, I realised that dreams were path in which my two main interests converged: the study of consciousness and the practice of creativity (which I have been able to experience through theater, comics and illustration, and as a musician and singer). Since then, I've been training and keeping up to date with the latest discoveries and proposals from cutting-edge international specialists. On the other hand, I have felt it essential to assimilate knowledge about dreaming from different cultures, as well as multiple philosophical and religious traditions. For example, I received the teachings of Tibetan Dream Yoga from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzin_Wangyal_Rinpoche">Lama Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche</a> during various retreats.</p>

<p>My educational vocation has led me to collaborate in different radio programs (among others, L'Ofici de Viure in Catalunya Ràdio and Via Lliure in RAC1) and to write articles for different publications like the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nine-months-to-dream_b_58594c18e4b06ae7ec2a419c">Huffington Post</a>, DreamTime, BodyMind and Mente Sana. I have also advised and participated in the <a href="https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/titol-programa/fitxa-programa/16605/">Somiers</a> (TV3) series of programs, dedicated entirely to dreams, and I have co-written the script for the film <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/volare/">Volare directed by Joaquín Oristrell</a>. I was a member of the professorial staff at the <a href="http://transpersonal.cat/en/el-iptb/">Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Barcelona</a> since its founding until, years ago, I began to offer from Mondesomnis the Training Integration of Dreams for psychologists and psychotherapists, the first in Spain dedicated exclusively to working with dreams. </p>

<p>My approach to assisting individuals and groups find their genius is based on the following understanding:</p>

<p>​I know that by divine design, and through evolution, our mind is without limitation and is capable of clearly and accurately seeing into the future through each “now” moment. And that the now is available to us to the degree that we have released the confines of the past.</p>

<p>I know that each human is a sovereign being capable of unlimited understanding and creative insights. We are gifted of tremendous feats of accomplishment through true collaboration with others.</p>

<p>​Because our mind is not bound within our body, it is not governed by matter’s laws of physics and our mind influences matter at every level through the harmonics of our prevailing attitude toward life.</p>

<p>​Releasing the unresolved issues from our past releases our unique gifts of intuitive reasoning. When we release our need to be right about past issues we naturally move our conscious awareness to ever expanding dimensions of knowing.</p>

<p>​We are able to attract or manifest anything we determine is vital to our purposeful needs.</p>

For 15 years I didn't use or accept money or conscious barter - nor did I take food stamps or other government dole. My philosophy has been to use only what is freely given or discarded and what is already present and already running (whether or not I existed). I don't see money as evil or good: how can illusion be evil or good? But I don't see heroin or meth as evil or good, either. Which is more addictive and debilitating, money or meth? Attachment to illusion makes you illusion, makes you not real. Attachment to illusion is called idolatry, called addiction. I simply got tired of acknowledging as real this most common world-wide belief called money! I simply got tired of being unreal. Money is one of those intriguing things that seems real and functional because 2 or more people believe it is real &amp; functional!</p>

<p>The Coat of Many Colors was a co-creation of John Van Daam, <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> and Kathryn Taylor at the Dream Tree Press, and published in cooperation with the Dream Network Bulletin. It received contributions by many writers and artists who went on to dedicate their lives to the field of dreamwork and dream research, and many became well-known in the field if they were not already at the time. </p>

<p>The Coat of Many Colors was intended as a snapshot of the dream movement at a time when it was just beginning to form a cohesive voice and self-awareness, and at the same time to foster this sense of collective purpose. </p>

<p>The Dream Tree Press itself was a huge crank-driven machine in the basement of the Taylors' house, and Jeremy's daughter <a href="https://createwithspirit.wpcomstaging.com/">Tristy</a> remembers as a child collating pages and stapling booklets together. This publication is made available here with the kind permission of John van Daam (also known as John van Damm) and Tristy Taylor. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Website: <a href="http://notesfromadreamer.com">notesfromadreamer.com</a></p>

<p>I am a dreamworker and author of Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming: A Personal Journey in Dream Interpretation. My current focus is on teaching others how to interpret and work with their own dreams. I have created several <a href="https://theazire.org/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11">online courses on dream interpretation</a>. I am also available to do workshops and one-on-one consultations via phone or Skype.</p>

<p>My interest in dreams began in 1988, after I left my husband of 13 years.  At that time, two dreams kept recurring over and over again; dreams which I had since I was 12. I knew these dreams were trying to tell me something, but didn’t know just what. In 1994, I discovered the book, Our Dreaming Mind, by <a href="../@bobvandecastle">Dr. Robert L. Van de Castle</a>, which helped me understand the process of dreaming.  With further reading and research, I began to slowly learn to decipher my dreams.</p>

<p>I have been actively enlightening others online about dreams since 2001, when I created my original Notes From a Dreamer… on Dreaming website to share my experience of learning to interpret my own dreams. Then, in late September 2008, I connected with Dr. Robert Van de Castle at an online PsiberDreaming Conference put on by the <a href="http://asdreams.org/">International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD)</a>. A few short weeks, several lengthy phone calls and numerous emails later, I left New Jersey and moved to Charlottesville, VA to live and work with him until his passing in January 2014. Working closely with Dr. Van de Castle, we created and taught an online course for Atlantic University, Becoming a Teacher of Dreamwork/Dream Interpretation. We also presented together at several conferences and co-authored an article for Explore! journal, <a href="http://www.explorejournal.com/article/S1550-8307(10)00099-6/abstract">Dreams As a Multidimensional Expression of PSI</a>.</p>

<p>I am an active member of the IASD for over 15 years and an elected member of the Board of Directors from 2014-2017. As such, I adhere to their <a href="http://www.asdreams.org/ethics-and-confidentiality/">ethical guidelines in dreamworking</a> which “supports an approach to dreamwork and dream sharing that respects the dreamer’s dignity and integrity, and which recognizes the dreamer as the decision-maker regarding the significance of the dream.” In other words, only the dreamer knows what their dream means. My goal in life is to help you learn to understand what yours are saying to you.</p>

<p>I believe that our dreams are the key to becoming more aware of who we are, why we are who we are and who we are supposed to be. If you care to join me, I’d like to help you learn to interpret your dreams as I have learned to do.</p>

<p>Robert’s background in dream work is varied. He has been involved with the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) for over 25 years. Through this organization, he has enjoyed the benefit of multidiscipline dream work expertise from around the world. He is a past president of IASD and has hosted multiple international dream conferences. He is a graduate of the two-year Dream Leader Training program offered by The Haden Institute in Charlotte. It was here that he gained much of his knowledge of Jungian archetypes. He was ordained through Sancta Sophia Seminary in Oklahoma's modern day wisdom school. The seminary opened his eyes to the relationships between dreams, astrology, and the ancient wisdom teachings.</p>

<p>Robert has a Master of Arts degree in guidance and counseling from Wayne State University in Detroit. He has also completed a year of Ph.D. level work in spiritual studies.</p>

<p>As early as 1970, He was organizing and leading dream discussion groups. His first was when he was serving with the United States Air Force in Turkey. Since then, he has conducted workshops on dreams in the Metropolitan D.C. area and in North Carolina. He designed a four-part mini course on dreams, which was well received in Asheville, NC.

<p>Marlene started her first dream journal at age 8. She has accumulated volumes since then filled with images, feelings, symbolism and characters that never fail to educate and inspire her and elucidate her waking world. Her philosophy is that working with people and their dreams is all about pulling in the pieces the unconscious hands us in our dreams, and integrating them into waking life to add dimension and arrive at that “ah-ha” meaning.</p>

<p>As a professional art therapist and active member in the dream community for over 35 years, her approach to dreamwork is both intuitive and eclectic, and is sensitive to each person based on her toolbox of knowledge and experience of working with individuals and groups. She believes that a creative approach to dreamwork via expressive means can be done through journaling, art, dance, writing or Gestalting with dream imagery or any expressive method meaningful to the dreamer.</p>

<p>Marlene served on the board and was a regular contributor to <a href="../@dreamnetwork">Dream Network Journal</a> for nearly two decades. Her column, “Dream Times,” appeared there and in the North Kitsap Herald. </p>

<p>You can schedule personal dreamwork by phone or email via the contact form on her <a href="https://www.dreamtimesguide.com/contact/">website</a>. She also has a blog, <a href="https://www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com/">www.thedreamplace.wordpress.com</a>, that contains inspirational true stories and reflections from her life.</p>

<p>Her inspirational novel, <strong><em>The Rainbow Watchers</em></strong>, released in the fall of 2018, is spiritual fiction based on a true NDE (near-death experience) that explores the possibilities life has to offer on both sides of the veil. <a href="https://www.therainbowwatchers.com/">To learn more, visit www.therainbowwatchers.com</a>.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>Consider the words of astronaut Edgar Mitchell, <em>"There are no unnatural or supernatural phenomena, only very large gaps in our knowledge of what is natural."</em></p>

<p>I used to say I was a convert from outer space to inner space, having a professional life in the aerospace industry during its early years, and eventually ending up much later fully immersed in the dreamwork field. I've become aware that all of my life experiences and interests have led to a greater understanding of myself and the world in which I live, as well as the many possibilites that exist beyond, yet to be explored.</p>

<p>In 1959, I nearly burned to death in an industrial accident, the explosion of rocket fuel in a laboratory in which I worked for one of our earliest pioneers in the aerospace industry. My life was saved by Ed Butler, a co-worker, who had repeated nightmares about the accident and rescuing me. When it happened in waking reality, he did as he had in the dreams, and I am alive because of his "dream rehearsals", as he calls them. Much of my life since that time has been a search to understand and use these wonderful gifts we are given nightly, particularly those mysterious experiences, such as telepathy, precognition, and other anomalous phenomena which current scientific theories can't fully explain but which happen to persons of all ages, cultures and belief systems. This search has led to a deeper understanding of the connectedness of all humans/dreamers and all of life, animate as well as what we label inanimate, which is nonetheless brimming with energy. We have enormous powers of the mind, waking and sleeping, and we're not using them... because we don't know we can. That is my current goal, to spread the good news and to make others aware not only of the collective unconscious which Carl Jung described, but also of a collective consciousness that drives our actions and our society. Beyond that, there is a sense of the universal collective that impacts upon everything in our universe.</p>

<p>In 1983, the same year that we founded the Metro D.C. Dream Community (MDCDC) in Vienna, VA, a Washington, DC suburb, I read of plans to hold an international multidisciplinary meeting on dreams. Persons were invited to send financial backing and thus become Founding Life Members of what was to become the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD). I sent in my $100 and have been hooked on MDCDC and IASD ever since! </p>

<p>Born in 1956, Paul Levy grew up in Yonkers, New York. In the mid-seventies he went to college at what was then called the State University of New York at Binghamton (now called Binghamton University), receiving degrees in both economics and studio art. While an undergraduate at Binghamton, he was hired by Princeton University to do research in economics. When he graduated college, he stopped his studies in economics and pursued his career in art, moving out to the Bay Area, where he was both making, and teaching art.</p>

<p>In 1981, due to an intense personal trauma, he had a life-changing spiritual awakening in which he began to recognize the dreamlike nature of reality. During the first year of his spiritual emergence, Paul was hospitalized a number of times, and was told he was having a severe psychotic break from reality. Much to his surprise, he was (mis)diagnosed as having a chemical imbalance and was informed that he had what was then called manic-depression (now called bi-polar disorder), and that he would have to live with his illness for the rest of his life and would need to take medication till his dying breath.</p>

<p>Little did the doctors realize, however, that he was taking part in a mystical awakening/shamanic initiation process, which at times mimicked psychosis but in actuality was a spiritual experience of a far different order, completely off the map of the psychiatric system. Fortunately, he was able to extricate himself from the medical and psychiatric establishment so that he could continue his process of self-discovery. Thankfully, as Paul freed himself from the shackles of psychiatry, he found his spiritual teachers, who instead of seeing Paul as crazy, recognized that he was beginning to spiritually awaken.</p>

<p>An artist, after the trauma of his shamanic break-down/break-through, he became a certified art teacher. Due to his interest in the work of C. G. Jung, by the end of the decade he became the manager of the C. G. Jung Foundation Book Service in New York, as well as the advertising manager for the Jungian journal Quadrant. In 1993, after many years of struggling to contain and integrate his non-ordinary experiences, Paul started to openly share his insights about the dreamlike nature of reality. He began giving talks and facilitating groups based on how life is a shared waking dream that we are all co-creating and co-dreaming together. He is the founder of the Awakening in the Dream Community in Portland, Oregon. </p>

<p>A pioneer in the field of spiritual emergence, Paul is a wounded healer in private practice, helping others who are also awakening to the dreamlike nature of reality. His work has gone through three phases: because of his intense interest in dreams (both night dreams and the dreamlike nature of reality), he was first known as "the dream guy." After writing <em>Dispelling Wetiko</em>, he became associated with the idea of wetiko. After the publication of <em>The Quantum Revelation</em>, he is now seen as connected with quantum physics. All three aspects - dreams, wetiko and quantum physics are interconnected and complementary facets of a deeper reality into which he is continually deepening his investigation. </p>

<p>He is the author of <em>The Madness of George Bush: A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis</em> (2006), <em>Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil</em> (2013), <em>Awakened by Darkness: When Evil Becomes Your Father</em> (2015) and <em>The Quantum Revelation: A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality</em> (2018). A Tibetan Buddhist practitioner for over 30 years, he has intimately studied with some of the greatest spiritual masters of Tibet and Burma. He was the coordinator of the Portland chapter of the PadmaSambhava Buddhist Center for over twenty years. </p>

    ns1:description """<p>Website: <a href="http://dreamgate.com/">dreamgate.com</a></p>

<p>In the early 1980s, I was working as a counselor for the City &amp; County of San Francisco. These kids were from broken homes and they had generally experienced little but abuse and neglect throughout their lives. As that time I was interested in how fantasy and creativity (and lack of it) played a role in development, but I didn't know much about dreams.</p>

<p>I began studying with Jungian analysts in San Francisco in the early 1980s, and found that dreams provided not only a wonderful arena for exploring fantasy and creativity but also provided a soulful feedback system and continual inner dialogue. After a few years I began studying with other people who worked with dreams in many other ways and shifted my focus away from pure Jungian dreamwork</p>

<p>I was especially interested in the lack of education that therapists were receiving in graduate counseling programs and began a dream tutoring practice to allow counselors from various modalities to respond to their clients' dreams in a more sophisticated manner. I felt a little boxed in by the work. The one-to-one contact was meaningful, but I felt I was not reaching a large enough audience. Also, the notion of dreams only being in the service of healing seemed limited. I wanted something that involved the wider culture. Both of these needs came together when I first experienced the Internet.</p>

<p>I began developing a wide variety of programs to network dreamworkers, distribute news, experiment with online dream sharing and provide information and education on dreams. This kind of global networking seemed the natural extension of the grassroots Dream Movement that had been developing since the 1960s, and I modeled much of the online community around this. The first part of the model I found in local dream sharing groups such as those made popular by Strephon William-Kapalan, <a href="../@jeremytaylor">Jeremy Taylor</a>, Gayle Delaney, <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stan Krippner</a>, <a href="../@montagueullman">Montague Ullman</a>, and many others. Another grassroots trend was a networked outpouring of information, education and creative group projects that included such organizations as BADG (Bay Area Dreamworkers Group), the Dream Library and Archive, and the Dream Network Journal.</p>

<p>My initial online community, the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/ed/">Electric Dreams</a> Community, had, and still maintains at its core, a peer/partnership paradigm, and a focus towards online dream sharing. As new Internet projects came up, various members volunteered to coordinate and direct them. In this way the community remained a public service, being able to offer a monthly magazine (e-zine), continual online dream groups, the Global Dreaming News, and other projects.</p>

<p>About the same time, I noticed that there was a great need for education about dreams and dreaming and started the DreamGate classes online which offered not only a background in the field of dreams, but hands-on groups through the Net.</p>

<p>In 1996 I was part of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) Conference Committee and developed the Computer and Internet Resource and Exhibition Center for the Berkeley Conference, as well as contributing to the initial development of the IASD presence online and IASD web site, which I now manage for IASD. I have been very impressed by the way IASD attempts to provide a way for all fields to come together and study dreams encompassing all sides of the dream field, from anthropology, dream therapies, dreams and spiritual work, dream inspired art and literature, non-clinical dreamwork, dream telepathy, dream bio-physiology, and many other disciplines.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, I was the IASD Webmaster, the Chair of the Electronic Communications Committee, and provided regular articles on dreaming and dreamwork online to the IASD magazine, Dream Time in the <a href="http://www.dreamgate.com/dream/cyberphile/">Cyberphile column</a>. This has allowed me to develop the online projects for IASD with many, many people from around the world, and unfold the IASD mission to provide dream education for the public and to make the Association a truly international enterprise. For example, beginning in 2002, IASD began offering an international online conference with Ed Kellogg, Ph.D., call the PsiberDreaming Conference, for which I built the technical infrastructure.</p>

<p>In 2005 I became the IASD Operations Director, managing the IASD office and its operations at the office in Berkeley. In 2018 the office went virtual and is now PO Box 206, Novato, CA 94948</p>

<p>Another interest has been interested in the application of philosophy to dreamwork. How can the application of novel ideas compliment and further the developments in dreamwork?</p>

<p>Even before co-authoring the <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong> best-seller, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XSJOTi">Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What it Means for Modern Relationships</a></em> (translated into 18 languages), with Cacilda Jethá, MD, Chris was on a wild ride. After receiving a BA in English and American literature in 1984 he spent the next two decades traveling around the world, pausing in unexpected places to work at decidedly odd jobs (e.g., gutting salmon in Alaska, teaching English to prostitutes in Bangkok and self-defense to land-reform activists in Mexico, managing commercial real-estate in New York’s Diamond District, helping Spanish physicians translate and publish their research). In his mid-30s, Chris decided to pursue doctoral studies in Psychology at Saybrook Graduate School, in San Francisco, CA, using his dissertation to critique mainstream views of human sexual evolution — providing the core arguments later advanced in Sex at Dawn.</p>

<p>Chris’s latest book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JI8Y1O">Civilized to Death: The Price of Progress</a></em> (Simon &amp; Schuster/Avid Reader Press, 2019), questions whether civilization has actually been a net benefit to our species. He hosts a weekly podcast, <em><a href="https://chrisryanphd.com/category/tangentially-speaking/">Tangentially Speaking</a></em>, often recorded from the road, while traveling in his van, Scarlett Jovansson. The podcast features conversations with famous comics, bank robbers, drug smugglers, porn stars, authors, and rattlesnake experts.</p>

<p>Art was born in 1940 in Indiana and grew up in Oklahoma. He has lived in Switzerland since 1973 and is the proud father of three children and four grand grandkids.</p>

<p>His first degrees were in physics (MIT, '62) (coherent optics) and he was involved with the early work in holography (Univ. of Mich, '67). He worked in metrology for NBS (now NIST) from 1967 to 1971. He earned his doctorate in the field of digital picture processing at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1979. From 1981 to 1993 he worked as a physicist in the eye department of the Insel University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland.</p>

<p>In 1973 he began his training to be a psychotherapist at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich which he completed in 1981. Since then he has had a private practice as a therapist in Bern where, in addition to seeing clients, he leads a monthly dream group. Since 1989 he has led a <a href="http://funkhouser.dreamunit.net/Dream-seminar-notes/dc2K_mod.htm">seminar in dreamwork</a> at the C.G. Jung Institute near Zurich. He has also led workshops in dreamwork in Switzerland, Australia and the U.S. Several years ago he was the originator and co-director of a research project into the effects of dream-telling, supported by two grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>One of his hobbies is research into déjà vu and precognitive dreams. For those interested, there are two articles he wrote about déjà vu: <a href="https://www.theoasisgroup.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=264">Three Types of Déjà Vu</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232529073_The_dream_theory_of_deja_vu">Dreams and Déjà Vu</a>. There is also now a website dedicated to <a href="https://deja-experience-research.org/">déjà experience research</a>. Recently two of his articles were published on the TherapyRoute website: <a href="https://www.therapyroute.com/article/a-way-to-do-dreamwork-by-a-funkhouser">A Way to do Dreamwork</a> and <a href="https://www.therapyroute.com/article/ten-dimensions-of-dream-meaning-by-a-funkhouser">Ten Dimensions of Dream Meaning</a>.</p>

<p>Linton Hutchinson has been working with dreams for over thirty years. He first introduced the use of dreams at Stonesoup School an alternative program based on Summerhill that he and others created to meet the needs of students that were bored to tears in public school. Kids from 8 to 18 were part of a community that shared dreams in the morning, wore their dreams during that day, and played at mutual dreaming and lucidity as easily as you might watch TV!! The dream classes at Stonesoup integrated the Seth Material Jung, and Cayce, with Gestalt, drawing, sculpture and endless plays and dramas of the conflicts and resolutions of their dreams at night.</p>

<p>Linton went back to school finished his Masters in Counseling and later his Ph.D. at Union Institute in Psychology. His dissertation was on the Waking and Dreaming Need Profiles of medical students in Grenada, West Indies and how they integrated dreams in their learning process.</p>

<p>Since that time, Linton has taught dream courses at Rollins College and integrated them in mental health counseling courses at the University of the South Pacific, Nova University, and the University of Central Florida. He was the Regional Coordinator for Webster University's Mental Health Counseling program where graduate students learned Dream Translation techniques using <a href="http://www.Dreamlynx.com">DreamLynx</a>, a web site devoted to the translation of dreams that he and his wife Beck created.</p>

<p>Linton believes that having students realize that working with unconscious material can help clients facilitate change is important in the therapeutic process. Giving students the skills to augment this process has been a a goal and opportunity that he has used.</p>

    ns1:description """<p>You can buy a physical copy of Ann's book <em>Satisfy the Image</em>, <a href="https://www.handprintpress.com/product/satisfy-the-image-the-wisdom-of-your-dreams-guided-imagery-for-self-balancing/">from Handprint Press here</a>.</p>

<p>Ann used Milton Erickson's common-sense and self hypnosis approach to dreams. She used art, dreams, and closed eye visioning in workshop intensives here and abroad. She taught at Lesley College Arts Institute, where she helped develop the Expressive Therapies Program, trained teachers, and earned her Master’s degree. Ann kept dream journals for fifty years, published two books on dreams, and was an ASD member and presenter for over 20 years, offering workshops and slide talks at IASD (almost every year), and at California’s Esalen Institute, The Cambridge center for Adult Education, and organizations here and abroad. She derived much inspiration from the work of Patricia Garfield, Freud, Jung, Milton Erickson, Gibran, the I Ching, the Dalai Lama, and others.</p>

<p>This adaptation of her Introduction to her last book, Satisfy the Image, summarizes her work: </p>

<p>Autodrama on the Paper Stage is a concrete mapping method that works for dreams and all kinds of life problems. You create your own symbols to represent the people and things in your story and set them on a sheet of paper we call the stage. Instead of telling the story in words, we use colored paper or found objects to represent characters and significant objects—it’s very simple. As you answer questions about the scene, you begin to understand the problem and manipulate the characters in search of resolution. </p>

<p>As a mini psychodrama, it shrinks the stage to a sheet of paper, eliminates other players, and offers a quick, direct approach. Working alone or with a guide, the dreamer plays all the roles, speaks and hears the dialogue, harvests projections, and negotiates a resolution. </p>

<p>The method came to me in a dream where I saw myself as a tiny human attached to the earth’s globe by gravity. Up in the universal darkness, a giant megaphone shouted “FIND THE IMAGE AND SATISFY IT.” Immediately I understood that the way to resolution was through the image, and the way to the image was through your feelings. </p>

<p>Since the age of three, I drew, painted, designed textiles, perfected and taught various crafts. When I had kids, I made bread sculpture, rag tapestries, furniture, and toys, and then turned it into how-to books. In the 1970’s, as Program Director for the Boston Children’s Museum Visitor Center, I developed how-to workshops so visitors could make paper, build looms and kites, and invent musical instruments from junk. I also conducted workshops for the New Hampshire elementary school system: sixty to ninety teachers came once a week for five-hour sessions on “Methods and Materials” and “Creative Enrichment.” We called it “Kindergarten for creatively deprived adults,” who were then very excited to take the ideas and methods back to their classes. </p>

<p>From there it was a short step to Expressive Therapy, a field just being defined at Lesley College. In addition to teaching there, I designed and completed my own Masters program based on work I did with teachers all over the country and in India. </p>

<p>Dreams were an arrow leading straight to the unconscious. Like parables, they provide perspective on truths too close to see. Visual methods make problem solving exciting because they require you to think outside the box and use all kinds of intelligence and sources of wisdom. Impatient with the time required by conventional dream work, I asked students to “show me your dream. Show me your problem. Create images. Make characters from torn tissue papers or find an object to represent people and things. Set the stage and tell the story on a sheet of paper.” </p>

<p>In half an hour, everyone in a class could create a scene and begin to work using ten simple questions. I just walked around the room helping to move things as needed. And there was the magic of working in groups. People borrowed from each other, saw what others were doing, heard the first solutions, and were inspired to take risks or reach out. Originality was rampant. Everyone left the room with new information, and often with a new resolution. </p>

<p>A Harvard student who took a workshop said, “This work you do is more interesting than all my psychology courses. I’d like my professor to see.” I did a workshop there, but the professor asked what books I was using, what theory? </p>

<p>“No books, no theory—just common sense and the wisdom of the dream, the power of peoples’ images. We simply ‘satisfy the image.’” </p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t going to make much sense to Academe is it?” he says. </p>

<p>“No. I guess not. It is not a theory; it is an experience.” </p>

<p>So you are the system. You are the method. It’s the doing that heals, creates change, and enlightens. When you experience it, you know it. It is the “Aha!” method. </p>

<p>Evelyn Duesbury is a National Certified Counselor (NCC), a Board Certified TeleMental Health Provider (BC-TMH-CCE), and a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). She is a member of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the American Psychological Association (APA), the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors (IAMFC), the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD), and The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi.</p>

<p>Duesbury’s earlier careers included working as a private secretary for patent attorneys, bankers, accountants, and general practice attorneys. After earning a B.A. in accounting and an MBA, she became a public accountant, then changed careers to education as an associate professor of accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. In 2000, Duesbury’s master of counselor education thesis, “Utilizing Dreams from a Systemic Perspective to Understand and Mollify Relationship Issues,” received the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s Outstanding Thesis Award. Since that time Duesbury and colleagues researched and explored her thesis-based Personalized Method for Interpreting Dreams (PMID) for seven additional projects. During those years, Duesbury developed and taught a distance education course to counselors on how to use her PMID model. The course guide that she wrote for her distance education class is the foundation for The Counselor’s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams: Family and Other Relationship Systems Perspectives.</p>

<p>Before writing The Counselor’s Guide for Facilitating the Interpretation of Dreams Duesbury worked on other projects. First, with assistance from her son, a writer, and consultation from E. B. Bynum, a clinical psychologist, Duesbury published a self-help book for the general population titled Living Dreams, Living Life, a Practical Guide to Understanding Your Dreams and How They Can Change Your Waking-Life. One night, after thinking about updating her distance education course guide, she thought to herself, “I am so occupied that I am unable to give time to my own dreams the way I want.” The next morning she woke with a dream that persuaded her to put her plans of working exclusively with her own dreams on hold. In the dream, her former accounting advisor suggested (in dream language) that she should transform her distance counseling course book into a “universal systems book.”</p>

<p>In waking-life several years earlier, an advisor had told Duesbury he had taken several positions to prepare him to do what he loves, teach. Duesbury likewise discovered that she loves to teach. She loves to show others how to use their dreams to improve their lives.</p>

<p>Fred C. Olsen, M.Div. is a teacher, counselor, and consultant who moved from a career in the space program to explore the frontiers of inner space. </p>

<p>He began his professional career in the Fall of 1965 following graduation from Seattle Pacific University with a B.S. in Mathematics. In 1967, Fred accepted a position with RCA International Service Corporation on a traveling team of technicians and engineers which was gearing up to calibrate satellite tracking stations for the NASA STADAN (Space Tracking and Data Acquisition Network), based at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p>In this position, Fred traveled regularly to many countries, where he was able to gain a unique view of a world in ferment during the late 1960s and early 1070s. At NASA, Fred's focus was on identifying the "highest" information that reflected the state of the system. An example was a measure of the ratio of signal to noise and the data quality associated with a range of readings of the ratio of signal to noise.</p>

<p>Olsen's concept of the "inner image" is the "highest information" source in the human psyche, both personally and collectively, what happens when the image changes. More importantly, this is the process by which the image forms and transforms in the human psyche. Jung's concept of the "transcendent function" sheds light on this problem.  The place at which the opposites meet in a balanced tension and equal relationship, is the place where transformation is possible.  If the conscious "ego" dominates, then we are back in the previous dilemma.  If the "ego" succumbs to the authority of the image, transformation is also sublimated and avoided.</p>

<p>Olsen's Inner Image Method lays out the process that has evolved over the last few decades of exploration and refinement of this approach.</p>

<p>Robert L. Van de Castle made his transition from this world on Wednesday, January 29, 2014.</p>

<p>Dr. Van de Castle's life work was devoted to dreams and dream research. He received his B.A in General Psychology at Syracuse University in 1951, his M.A. in Clinical Psychology at University of Missouri in 1953, and his PhD in Clinical Psychology from University of North Carolina in 1959. He was a Professor Emeritus at University of Virginia Health Sciences Center (retired 1993) where he was the Professor of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry (1986-1992), Director of the Clinical Psychology Internship Project (1980-1992) and Director of the Sleep and Dream Laboratory (1967-1985).</p>

<p>He is the author of the book, Our Dreaming Mind, which was described as a "landmark" by <a href="../@montagueullman">Monte Ullman</a>, a "masterpiece" by <a href="../@henryreed">Henry Reed</a>, and "a sweeping compilation unsurpassed in the literature for its scope" by <a href="../@stanleykrippner">Stan Krippner</a>. With Calvin Hall, he co-authored The Content Analysis of Dreams, which became a standard reference book and a "how-to-do-it" manual for investigators wishing to examine dream content in a quantitative fashion that could be statistically evaluated.</p>

<p>In addition, he always felt that trying to familiarize the public with the fascinating realm of dreams was important. He discussed dreams on such national TV shows as Phil Donahue, Barbara Walters, David Letterman, Tom Snyder, and Mike Douglas. He also presented at two programs involving dreams hosted by Rita Dwyer at the Smithsonian Institution, spoke on the Voice of America radio show, and his articles appeared in prominent newspapers such as The Washington Post, USA Today, and Chicago Tribune and in a wide variety of popular magazines, such as Psychology Today and Ladies Home Journal. He also presented talks and workshops on dreams in Belgium, Canada, Latvia, Mexico and Russia, and attended and presented papers at most of the IASD conferences throughout the years, including those in Holland and Denmark.</p>

<p>He was most proud of his efforts to develop the IASD as an organization that represents a "rainbow coalition" of dreamers from around the world. He was honored to present at the first annual international ASD conference in San Francisco in 1984 and then become the next ASD president. He introduced active participation in dream workshops, the infamous Dream Ball, a Dream Telepathy contest, and sessions on lucid dreaming. He was the recipient of IASD’s first Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition, he was a Past President of the Parapsychological Association (1970). Most recently, he was on the Advisory Board of DreamsCloud, the world's foremost dream related website.</p>

<p>He is survived by his sons, Drake Cameron Van de Castle and Keith Dawson Van de Castle; daughter, Parker Mary York and daughter-in-law, Teresa Spigle Van de Castle. He is also survived by his sister, Mary Elizabeth Hinton; his loving partner of five plus years, <a href="../@bobbieannpimm">Bobbie Ann Pimm</a>, and three grandchildren.</p>

<p>I began my artistic work in the 1980’s as a graphic designer, operating my own design firm with clients throughout the state of Colorado, where I reside. During this time I also became known in the area for the historic murals I painted with private and public commissions, and for my work as President of the Berthoud Arts and Humanities Alliance, lending my support to other Colorado artists.</p>

<p>Preferring a new direction from commercial expression, I have recently begun to devote my talents to subjects with personal meaning, and my artistic work now reflects a passion for inner examination. Dream images have captivated my imagination and provide an unending source of inspiration for my paintings. It is my desire to express the mystery of the psyche’s inner world and the power of dreams to impact and change our lives.</p>

<p>In the year 2000, I was invited to be the attending artist to the International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and in 2001 my work was included in the art exhibit, “Dream Odysseys,” at the Porter Gallery, UC Santa Cruz, and featured in a presentation at the annual ASD conference.

<p>Linda Lane Magallón, MBA invested more than 18 years in the field, researching lucid, mutual, telepathic and flying dreams. She was editor of the Dream Network Bulletin alongside <a href="../@bobtrowbridge">Bob Trowbridge</a> from 1987-1989. </p>

<p>Practicing under the discipline of the "Dream-Art Scientist" (a model based on the Jane Roberts' Seth material), she has mastered many dreaming skills and dreamwork techniques.</p>

<p>Linda authored the ground-breaking book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050308133701/http://members.aol.com/DreamPsi/archive/mutualdreaming.html">Mutual Dreaming</a> (Pocket Books, 1997). She served as editor and publisher of the principal magazine in the dream field, Dream Network. Having written articles for such magazines as FATE, American Psychic Magazine and the OMNI newsletter, she most recently wrote "Dream Trek," a column in the Internet E-zine <a href="http://dreamgate.com/dream/electric-dreams/edreams-g01.htm">Electric Dreams</a>.</p>

<p>Active in the dreamwork community since 1984, Linda was a founding board member and wrote the first mission statement of the multidisciplinary (and highly academic) <a href="https://www.asdreams.org/">Association For the Study of Dreams</a> (ASD). She has presented papers and hosted panels at several of ASD's annual conferences. In 2001, she helped design the conference web site, the Computer Café, and created the four picture targets for the Dream Telepathy Contest.</p>

<p>With Fred Olsen, she co-founded the Bay Area Dreamworkers Group (BADG), to provide support for her dreamwork peers in the San Francisco area. There, she practiced dream sharing, perfected dreamwork techniques and uncovered the basic values of the Partnership Paradigm. After BADG presented her with an honorary "Doctoral Degree in Social Dreamology," Linda graduated from dreamworker to dreamplayer.</p>

<p>The observer-participant brand of research has required that Linda dream along with the other members of her dreaming team. Searching for active participants in a sleepy field like dreams is not an easy task, whether on-line or off. To help find such dreamers for her half a hundred group dreaming projects and dream telepathy experiments, Linda served as coordinator of the Seth Dream Network and dipped into the lucid dream community before founding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050305230701/http://members.aol.com/lucidflier/project/fbnc.html">Fly-By-Night Club research group</a>.</p>

<p>Linda's goal has been to encourage the emergence of the Super Self through dreams. Her research has lead her to experiment with such flying and floating variations as virtual reality games, scuba diving, ballooning, gliding, hang gliding and flying a Piper Tomahawk. She has found flying dreams to be both extremely practical (resolving nightmares) and highly inspirational (launching further extraordinary dreams). She believes flying dreams to be at the hub of dream understanding and appreciation.</p>

<p>A poet, novelist, essayist, storyteller, teacher, healer and medicine woman who has taught and counseled for over fifty years, in the process of which she has developed therapies (Healing Stories) which creatively address life threatening diseases, spiritual and emotional crises, as well as community, political and environmental disintegration.</p>

<p>Deena has spent a lifetime investigating Story as a form of knowing and healing. As a writer, she asks: Who do we have to become to find the forms and sacred language with which to meet these times?</p>

<p>She conducts training groups on the spiritual, creative, political and ethical aspects of healing and peacemaking, individual, community and global, drawing deeply on alliance with spirit, indigenous teachings and the many wisdom traditions. One focus is on uniting Western medical ways with indigenous medicine traditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To follow Story is to understand the path of healing. Each of our stories is a universe. Each one of us is living a story. To discover its shape and essence is essential to soul making.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With writer/healer Michael Ortiz Hill, she has introduced the concept of Daré, meaning Council, to North America. The Topanga Daré relies on Council, alliance with Spirit and the natural world, ancestor work, indigenous and wisdom traditions and teachings, music healing, dream telling, divination, kinship, and story telling to achieve personal transformation, community healing and social change.</p>

<p>She is the author of many books, including the novels;  <em>A Rain of Night Birds</em>, (2017), <em>La Negra y Blanca</em> (2012 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in Literature), <em>Feral</em>; <em>Ruin and Beauty: New and Selected Poems</em>; <em>From Grief Into Vision: A Council; Doors: A Fiction for Jazz Horn</em>; <em>Entering the Ghost River: Meditations on the Theory and Practice of Healing</em>; <em>The Other Hand; What Dinah Thought</em>; <em>Tree: Essays and Pieces</em>; <em>The Woman Who Slept With Men to Take the War Out of Them</em>; and <em>Writing For Your Life</em>.</p>

<p>On my last day in art school in 1974, I had a creative awakening. In a moment of playful exploration, I moved my fingertips on a paper towel instead of wiping the inked plate. Lifting the towel, I saw childlike scrawls on the underside, created by the pressure of my touch. I laughed ecstatically with this discovery! This was a precious gift; a direct mode of expression that fulfilled my longing for a more natural way to draw. I sensed it was emerging for more than my own personal use.

    ns1:description """<p>By way of introduction, may I share two of the dreams/experiences that compelled me onto this path, an abbreviated dream autobiography. It is, of course, an ongoing adventure.</p>

<p>The event that marked my starting point appeared in the form of a technicolor, stereophonic sound, full length movie-like dream which was the first of its kind in my experience. Its power and beauty were such that I recorded it, not knowing why at the time.</p>

<p>Many other dreams followed, compelling enough that I started journaling regularly and began reading what related literature I could find. But it wasn't until that particular dream took the form of an actual event several years later that I got deeply involved.</p>

<p>This dream occurred during summer 1975 and in it,</p>

<p><em>I find myself in a community center (which in waking life housed the office in which I was working). In every room of this building are people participating in an amazing variety of artistic activities: dancers, singers, musicians, artists...</em></p>

<p>The energy in the dream and afterward was exhilarating!</p>

<p>In the Autumn of l980, the mayor of my community, in his weekly column in the local newspaper, cast an open invitation for "someone" in the community to coordinate an event. I considered accepting that invitation by calling together a group of colleagues to brainstorm ideas and as that process was unfolding, ideas and images were being put forth from members of the group which formed in my mind's eye a clear memory of the above-mentioned dream. To the group I exclaimed "My God, this reminds me of a dream I had five years ago!" One person responded immediately: "Then we've got to do it!"</p>

<p>The program was scheduled, very well attended... and I found myself presiding over a virtual re-enactment of the dream in full detail. It was the ever-sought-after experience of Being at the intersection between the dreamworld and daytime 'reality.' The occasion for this event was the 35th anniversary of the United Nations.</p>

<p>By the way, the photo (above) was taken during that event:</p>

<p>A Dream Come True! Can you tell?</p>

<p><em>"To live mythically is to seek guidance from your dreams, imagination, and other reflections of your inner being, as well as from the most inspiring people, practices, and institutions of your society.</em></p>

<p><em>To live mythically is also to cultivate an ever-deepening relationship with the universe and its great mysteries."</em></p>

The Smithsonian Institute invited him to give a lecture about his "Dream Solutions" method of creative dream work.</p>

<p>He is Senior Fellow at the Edgar Cayce Institute of Intuitive Studies where he regularly provides training, consultation and research. He is also a Licensed Professional Counselor with a private practice in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, specializing in intensive, transformational work, centered in dreams, energetic healing, and creativity.

    ns1:description """<p>The Dream Network Journal was published in printed form from 1982 to 2015, a place for people to share the wonder and mystery of dreams. Thanks to our <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/dream-network-journal">crowdfunding supporters</a>, this archive offers all issues of the DNJ for download, and reproduces many articles in blog form.</p>

<p>Below, you can download each volume as a .zip file, or download each issue individually from the list of images. If you'd like to look up an individual author or article, there's a growing <a href="../@dreamnetwork~contributors">authors page</a> here, and a (not-quite-complete) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfm83Fnx9m9Q_Bfu3bpDv2kQqUwDG6exOj-Zny-MnMw/edit?usp=sharing">list of Dream Network articles</a> in spreadsheet form.</p>

<p>Rather than republishing these PDFs online, please just link to this site. We also ask you not to publish the articles in the journals, unless you have the permission of the author (or you are the author, in which case, the rights are yours!)</p>
