## Oreanhadywark

Dreambodywork is a comprehensive therapeutic process developed by Arnold Mindell, a Jungian analyst, researcher and author who lectures at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzepland. Dr. Mindell is an American who has lived in Zurich for twenty years. He travels periodically to the United States conducting seminars in dreambodywork This article and interview grew out of a four day seminar held in Eugene, Oregan in August, 1982.

- One of the most significant and exciting frontiers in contemporary psychology is the continuing discovery and exploration of the mind-body unity. The dreambodywork of Dr. Arnold Mindell holds one or the leading edges in this area of research and practice. Just as dreams reveal to us in images and feelings those parts of our personality which are unconscious; in dreambodywork, bodily conditions and diseases are viewed as processes through which the unconscious expresses itself in a most graphic manner. Dreambodywork consists in using the body (sensations, posture, symptoms) as a source of information about the unconscious mind. The primary method of working with the dreambody is to allow the symptoms of conditions of the budy to speak for themselves by amplifying or exaggerating them. Then through dialogue and an exploration of the felt experience of the body, the meaning of the body condition emeryes. Seeing the body as an expression of the unconscious mind beings immediacy and a cemapkable quality of aliveness to the therapeutic process. Dreams are of ten remembered spontaneously during the course of the session, lending weight to Mindell's notion that the body dreams. In this model of mind-body consciousness, awareness of pain, the felt experience of disease, posture and energy level reveals that right now your body is having a dream. Years of research into the human energy systems of other cultures (Tibetan, Chinese, Indian) have resulted in Mindell's hypothesis of the dreambody.

During the seminar in Eugene, four people each day underwent intense individual sessions in the group setting. The process usully proceeds from a report of a body condition, a aream or a relationship issue. Dr. Mindell listens to the client presenting his or hep story from across the room. He is awaiting a body signal which invites him to make closer contact with the individual. This acute focus on the non-verbal aspects of behavior is one of the main characteristics of this process-oriented work and Dr. Mindell's own therapeutic style. Once close physical proximity has been established, he begins to draw out information by exploring both conscious and unconscious comminication. For example, a woman at the seminar who told of an abdominal problem (spastic colitis) used her hands to demonstarate the feeling in her body. As she began to make grabbing gestures, Dr. Mindell engaged with her:
"What is that hand doing? Do that some more. Really let that hand go. Co ahead, grab the air. What are you grabbing for'?

In the discussion that followed, they discovered that she was trying to hold onto feelings which were present in a relationship that had outwardly been over for many years. She spoke of having never reached comparable levels of closeness with any partner since that tione. The woman told of having gone from city to city distracting herself from the pain of this loss.

DREAM EMERGES SHONTANEOUSLY
Two important elements of process dreambodywork were evident in this session. An unfinished, unexpressed
psychic content (the feelings of holding on to the relationship) manifested in the body as a colon problem. Also, in this process, a dream came to awareness spontaneously as the work evolved. In her dream she was climbing through huge worm tunnels with her boyfriend. As they visited friends in several rooms in the tunnels, he would disappear, and she immediately felt distraught at the loss of his presence. Dr. Mindell surgested that the worm tunnels might indicate how the two of them were together In her colon problem. This seemed to strike a meaningful chord As with all effective dreamwork, it is the response from the dreamer which determines whether or not in interpretation is useful. The degree to which Dr. Mindell's idea hit the mark for this dreamer became cleap as she began speaking of how the onset of her physical symptoms corresponded to the time of the relationship break-up six years before.

How can one make use of these discoveries about the mindbody contimum? Dr. Mindell's message advises that by bringing more of ourselves into our relationsnips, that is by expressing and commenicating our needs and feelings, we diminish the need for our body to express our unconscious mind in symptoms and diseases. for those already convinced of the value of paying attention to dreams, listening to the dreambody is the next step in developing even greater self-awareness. Great flexibility of format characterizes dreambodywork in the course of the four day seminar, processes resembling each of the following therapies were employed: gestalc, bioenergetics, art, dance, movement, psychodrama, role playing, martial, arts, yogic breathing and active imagination. All of the participants had the opportunity to go deeply into the central issues of their lives because of the flexibility inherent in the approach, and the immeaiacy with which Dr. Mindell follows the individual's process.

## TAO UNDERLIES PROCESS WORK

To accurately follow an individual's process (of perception-expression, blockage-release) requires an open, unbiased attitude on the part of the practitioner. Mindell sees the Chinese concept of the Tao as the archetypal structure behind his emerging model. Following the Tao means allowing for shythins of change, and requires the ability to respond flexibly as natural processes unfold and take their winding course of development. The Tao reminds us to be with whatever is, as it is unfolding. In this light, it is the most accurate model for drearibodywork.

While the Taoist viewpoint provides a philosophical model for this approach to therapy, the work is also grounded in psychological theory and experience. Several theuretical considerations were discussed in conversations 1 held with joe Coodbread, a student and colleague of Mindell's who was participating in the seminar. He outlined a framework for understanding the important features of dreambodywork.

1) Using bodywork in addition to dreams gives one the opportunity to observe and work with where the unconscious is in the moment instead of where it was when the dreamer had the dream.
2) By following the actual process going on in the individual, one uses the form of therapy demanded byoghe proces's itself, not by a predetermined therapeutic
3) following the emerging process forces the therapist to have a research orientation. One must constantly be asking questions and revising one's model in response to new observations.
4) If one follows the process consistently, one is forced to bring one's own experience into the work. The practitioner effectively engaged in process work cannot hide behind a therapeutic model or persona.

Personal as well as professional uses can be found for those intrigued by the dreambody concept of Arnold

Mindell. Great potential lies in the widespread understanding and application of the basic ideas governing this approach to self knowledge. Dreambodywork teaches that body symptoms and conditions are slyns ofunconscious contents (often feelings) that have not yet appived In our awareness. As with dreams, in which attitudes of feelings we haven't acknowledged become expressed as stories and images, the body also portrays parts of our total nature we have not accepted. Body difficulties, says Dr. Mindell, give us just the piece of information we meed to see curselves more clearly. For this reason he suggests that being sick is like having a big dream. Mindell believes that body and dream phenomena are like mirror images of one another. He has found in working with people for over ten years that when one begins to become the person one has been suppressing (through halp in therapy), the symptoms and conditions diminish or disappear. They are no longer needed to express the suppressed papt of the personality. It is important to note that these results follow from an attitude of first apprectating and accepting the disease or symptom for what it is. One asks oneself: What is the body doing and saying on its own to reveal the selfi Instead of subjecting the body to a prescribed regimen of moves or manipulatrions designed to break down of through character structure, Mindell sensitively follows Jung's notion of looking at what is already the case, assuming it has a purpose and a meaning. This purposive view of tuman behavior and mind-body functioning is one of the hallmarks of the fungian school.

How does one apply this notion that the body is a rich source of information about the unconscious mind I tested the applicavility of dreambodywork as soon as 1 returned from the seminar. During a therapy session, one of my clients understandably expressed fear and caution about coming into contact with deeply buried feelings. As she spoke, she sat with crossed legs, her arms holding her knees in a contracting, protectıve position. I. asked her to amplify of exaggerate her posture, to allow it to go fupther, wherever necessary, to express itself. She then lay down and curled up saying, 'I want to hide." Encouraging the 'hider', I asked her after a pause to say what she was aware of internally. linmediately she stated, 'I've been dreaming about this. In my dream, me and Booby (brother) were hiding in the attic of a warehouse. We were safe there." This example duplicated a phenomenon 1 observed several times in the dreambodywork seminar. The posture of bodywork enticipated a drean, and the individual would spontaneously remember the dream, while engaged in exploring the awareness accompanying the body position.

While working in the grow setting, Dr. Mindell proved to be a remarkable example of spontaneity and human freedom. He was playful and childlike, humorous and extremely movement oriented in his work with clients. The range of motion in both his voice and body brought an aliveness to the seminar, which was both freeing and fun for the entire group. He is saying to the world through his work: Let us continue to search, to look deeply at the tuman condition by looking deeply at ourselves. The power of the work he is doing on the edge of the mindbody frontier is but hinted at in this report. It is my hope that we will be hearing more from this energetic researcher, who encourages us to awaken our dreaming bodies and live as consciously as possible.

Here are two encounters I had this jear with teachers in the treantime...

10 Jan 82
"... I meet a moman, who is the tnearnation in the present world of Eabul 3ingh. Ue enbrace and love is one, we together. She is wondertul.

## Premathe Huseshec Crab

Once in a blue moon, I will have a dreas so haunting and vivid that a residue of its feeling infests gy life for days and even weeks after 1 awake. There's realiy no way to do justice to such a dream in its telling; its import does not lie in the sum of its details, and ey florid superlatives and waving hands merely elicit indulgent giles from aildly bored friends. Capturing a drean in words is devilishly elusive. Trapping a chimera would be a eore straightiorward endeavor. The most gripping dreams overflow with sentiaents and syabols which denand of the waking mind an aleost dreanlike suspension of disbelief if their subtleties are to be fully apprehended.

Prema, the horoine of my frean, used to be my psychotherapist. I sia a veleran of many years of psychotherapy gysell, and I was her very first client. I have consulted strict Frevdians, reality-integtrative therapists, touchy-feely secular humanist stick-your-pud-in-the-mud eclectic types, neditation freaks, psilocybin boohoos, Valivm croakers, brain police, you nane it. There's no catechise I haven't taken, no ctoss I haven't kissed, and l've got news for you: none of it works if you haven't got heart. The courage has to grow from within. Hy flame had flickered and waned, and I feared for py soul. Preme had a good heart, something I hadn't tried yet, and anjway, I was a desperate sean, so I retained her.

In a nutshell, 1 had seen all the tricks, sensed her ineaperience, and warned her whenever 1 saw she was taking a wong turn with me. 1 actually began to develop a paternal attitude to ay Prema. Ker heart wes gigantic, but she was naive and valnerable, and a psychopath night have preyed upon her nurturant inctincts to feed his own warped appetites. But 1 worshipped the ground she walked on, and aade sure to slow if train of thought so that she couid learn her job well. Oh, she was an angel to me. She would set me on her lap and mother me. She woold drive te to and fron therapy in hex little bug, and sometimes on the way home she would bare her sovi to Be, confess her love affairs with men and women, solicit advice on how to lead her chaotic life. I would listen with deep and abiding conpassion, then offer ay wise counsel.

So l't poking fun at Prena. Nobody's perfect, and 1 hope you ean tell I do it with great love and respect. The highest spirits always run the risk of utter folly and hunilation, and Prema did zore for me than any of those ailquetoasts with the diplomas on the wall and the fifty-minute hours. Her intuitive penius was remarkable. Thanks to her brilliant catalysis, the loose ends fion all my previous years of therapy fell into place within the space of a couple of short months. 1 sav to the roots of my chronic anger with agonising clerity. Now I had access to all sorts of grisiy priaitive eaterial that gost folks carry to the grave locked down securely within their dark hearts.

Aecording to the dogra of some professionals, the acule insights I had developed would signify, it not a 'cure', then at least a rational endpoint to
psychotherapy. In fact, I felt I was doing so well that one day I announced to Prese that there was nothing eore for me to do in therapy, that I was indeed cured Prema agreed with me, handed me an imaginary diploma, and shook ay hand. Problea: Thy, then, alter having had all the insights, did I still feel terror when faced with the prospect of intimacy? And why this choking angst now that 1 was confronted with saying goodby to her who had beouse my very best triend in the whole world?

1 tried to laugh off ay schoolboy feeling, this audlin transference behavior. I confided to Prema ay growing seaval feelings fpr her, and coazed her to
adeit that the feelings aight be reciprocal. She couldn't hide her unease with ae from ae after that. We continued floundering about with ay therapy, with her trying to hypnotize ae out of ay avoidant personality traits, and me hynotising her right back half the time. Hy saviour had gotten well out of her depth with me. We both knew it, but lacked the judgement to terminate the reas.

So desperately did I want our relationship to continue that my subconscious engineered a number of elli-destructive 'aceidents' just to perpetaate ay syrbiotic dependence upon freta. The last of these episodes (the details of which are none of jour business) nearly brought about ay death and the corfeiture of my soul, and it was at this turn that prema finally decided to throw in the towel. She dove me to the office of another psychotherapist, this big, pushy. New Yort City temale-person in a tweed suit, who helped us do a quickie post-mortim on our relationship. This session ended with Presa in tears and me nearly so. "When I tinighed therapy with Arthur, he told ae I had my boundaries together. What happened to ay boundaries? Preas bawled, as I stared through her into infinity with racant cynicis. She wilted before ny epes. Her little feet dangled from her tiny legs, not quite reaching the floor. Ms. NYC threw her a stuffed panda to coddie. Ky abject iftie triend looked so appealing that way I had the urge to cradle her in my arms and stroke her head and make the hurt 90 avay.

We agreed to call it quits. She drowe me home one last tize, we hogged each other dearly, her hot tears got by tee-shirt danp, and l've never heard fiom her since. 1 heard a rumor she's teaching elesentary school now, and back in therapy herself.

About two meaks later I had this dreas:
"In the rusty \&.A. dawn 1 drove Prema west on Venice Boulevard, beneath the garish anticriae lights, through have the color of jaudiced wine illumined by the bilious rising sun. Diazond sneakered plaps were rounding up their gem studded women, obliterated winos snored in pools of vomit, and the tires of the Mudshark crepitated through shards of muscatel shortdogs that had been dashed against the asphalt. The Mudshark: that exumpled brownpaper gluesnift bag-looking thing 1 called ${ }^{-1}$ wheels. The hood had been wenched off in a windstorm, and every single panel on her had been eangled hideously.
"Pima was conted out in the passenger seat, and 1 drove her, as I said, west through the bloodshot dawn down the boulevard into tacky old Venice, soene of countless annestic debavehes in bohenian jam dives. Oh, we went to psjchotic ertremes. It zakes ae oringe to think about it, like raking a hangnail down a chalkborid. Prema, Fresa, whaterer's becone of us! You look like a bloated cadaver, enufling muscously by my side. You reek of stale gin and leftover Antabuse, and so do 1 . Your pulfy, feverish face, your edematous fowls and gecko eyelids... A dead giveaway that the bad Prene is ascendant this gorning. You confessed to ae once during a session when you were trying to sell at a muliple personality. You've got that wanton, congested pelvis look...just aching for it. Pirate Prema. I warned you about me, and how this would cone to pass. Ditn't 1 prediet every detall of this sordid melotrama the day we aet! You were playing with tire, Shrink, and now you're broken in the gutter down here with se. Didn't I tell jou the time they woke me in By room...hey, listen to this, Prema, listen to my probles...my rood when I lived at the Ashran, wondering after $\mathbf{Z}_{\text {I }}$ now spiritual name?

## My Gremomother's Gifts

The Mother Earth Archetype in Dreams
by Elisabeth Rush
'The earth o.has an antiquity, by our reckoning, of the order of thirty thousand million years; the pre-history of man goes back one million years and that of living creatureso.ocan be tracied back some twenty thousand million years. Thus we ourselves are connected and entangled with this earth in a way which we still cannot realise even now. History and archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biology and zoology, and preceding them chemistry and physics, all this is the history of the earth, all this is 'we ourselves'; it is the root-stock from which we stem' (1)

The Earth in many symbol systems has been correlated to the feminine. As such it has been, due to the predominance of the patriarchal perspective in most of the world's philosophies, characterized as "unconscious making. instinct-entangling and dangerous" (2). The Earth has been designated as the primitive bestial mass from which the heroic ego is destined to emerge and to conquer. Joseph Campbell's HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES is a catalogue of the shapes the eso assumes in lis quest to differentiate from the dominance of the earth.

The attitude of modern man toward the Mother Earth can be mainly characterized as usurous. He has used the resources for culture building and industry without recognition or regard fur her finite resources. Antjecology persists as the dominant mode of man's interaction with the Earth.

The heroic misadventure has become the dominant develupmental theory of conteinpurary psychology. From a holistic perspective, the hero has become a perverted archetype or 'sub-myth'(3) which has for the most part strayed from it's original functiun as a bringer of gifts of new consciousness to culure. The sub-hero indiscriminateIy slays dragons (not coincidentally an ancient symbol of the feminine) for the ego gratification it brings, rather than the accomplishment of any goal of individuation. Adulthood is equated with independence(5) from and ignorance of what is termed 'the possesive, imprisoning, depriving and devouring mother."(6)

It seems appropriate, during this time when many are working to develop a holistic and transformative vision of human reality, that our relationship to the Earth Mother archetype undergo a revisioning, which accounts for the Earth as 'prima materia' from which we all are born, and carrier of natural law upon which we depend for survival.

My own relationship to this archerype is reflected in a serias of dreams ; had beginning in the Spring of 1980:

Rosie, my Grandmother was dying. I felt huge sorrow and loneliness at my loss of her. I begged her (my greatest source of love and support) to stay with me a little longer. She said she could not.
She lay down in a flower bed in my yard and died. Part of her body became rosebushes. I watched a transmutation of
Rosie to flowers, growing and dying, and then to composted soil. And then I heard her voice: 'I will always be with you now. I an your Mother Earth."

The Rose is the ancient archetypal symbol for the convergence of the many into the embrace of the One. Elemire Zolla says that 'the most typical visionary scene is that of the animated breathing rose, or in the East, a lotus". He goes on to say, "Just as iron filings gather round a lodestone into a rose of iron, or a constant whirlwind turns sand into a 'rose of the desert', so
symbological instinct untiringly connects Perfection with the Rose, from Indla to Parsia to the medieval mystical rose of the divine hosts round the supreme Codhead. $(7)$

The transformation of the Rose, my Crandmother and namesake as well as a symbol of the MotherEarth, signified the beginning of the development of a relationship between my consciousness and the most basic temale archetype.

The first phase of my journey was marked by the painful realization that the archetype within was in a state of decay, and had become indifferent to me because of my ignorance of her value. Several dreams explored the theme of a gradually awakening increase in esteem for the archatype and a fear that it might disappear from my life because of my own unworthlness. When the archerype, my Grandmother, underwent another dream death it was a deeply significant experience for me.

Rosie is being held in a hospital. I 80 to her room. I llft the blanket, there is Rosie, a small shrouded being about three feet long.

The people (nursesi) say she is unresponsive. I say her name and she moves. I talk and she knows who I am. I ask her to move up and she responds by turning round and moving tp toward the head of the bed. She also begins to shrink. She shrinks from three feet to small enough to fit into a watchpocket. I ask her to lie in my arms and this tiny creature does and I tell her I love her and she dies.

At the end of this dream I was befriended by a giant (an animus figure) who helped me defend the bridy (of the Earth) from the attack of a man from the institution in which she had been incarcerated (the status quo, patriarchal reality). In the next dream, the second phase of the journey was characterized by withdrawal from the status quo:

An old man, the patriarch of a family
business, accused me of being incestuous
(becoming one in consciousness with the
archetype) with my Grandmother.
Next came two dreams which indicate that the Medial archetype (the elemental energy which mediates the divine to the individual) has entered the process to facilitate the necessary changes. I have moved out of one style of consciousness and begin to experience the manifestation of Grand (archetypal) Mother energy.

The living room was odd. There were two fireplaces. One was like a shadow or a reflection of the other, unsubstantial (auric)...there were bookcases, candles and on top of it, several birds (owl, raven...)
Rosie is in the kitchen. I was going to
live in the living room.
Water is progressively covering a series
of houses. One of them is Rosie's.
After the medial has swallowed up the ego there is a denovement in which the Self begins to take shape at a more integrated level.(8) The following dreams are healing experiences in which it is clear that something essential is being passed from Rosie to me, that the Mother Earth is being integrated.

I am walking to Rosie in a beautiful, really charming little town. It's a slow pace. There is a lovely spired church. I think we're walking, pushing a vendor's cart. Passing shops and window shopping. It's the first time r've been to this town. We pass a bakery which is simply huye, open air racks of bread in a courtyard. We yo to Rosie's cafe, where she shows me seven or eight options from the bakery. I want several. She is willing to bake some. And she has a recipe which she will also give to me. help* her as she doesn't make enough money. I say, "Can you do something special, unique?"

Walking with Rosie over land, our ranch, but there is a lot of strange activity. I recognize the terrain, but all else is strange. She has a sweater-jacket on her right shoulder but doesn't put it on. I notice and intend to give her my sweater, but it takes me some time to respond. Finally. I take off mine and put it on her. She is warmed. 18 is night. There are miners or oil well drillers working. Fires burning. Slag heaps, coal heaps and puddles - mul/oil. We are pulling on some pipes with a group of men. Rosie and I working side by side. I have crouble getting time to put her sweater on.

We go to a caravanserai and share a glass of rose.

1 am in a house full of furniture and my Grandmother or Codmother Rosie. She is agresing to sell the house to me. It will be a stretch to buy it. I am excited about telling Jerry when he comes home for huch. She says she will take the furniture out and I say, "Oh, it will be empty'. We go into a big sitting room and there are two bathtubs, one on top of the other. I motice as I walk across the floor that it slants down. The house in that part is becoming one with sinking into the ground. My Grandmother says, 'it's a very old house'.

Shortly after these dreams, my co-facilltator of a women's spiritual group had the following dream:

I am going to a nearby restaurant. I see women sitting at an outdoor umbrella. I say, "Ho Demeterl" A woman looks w.
It is Elisabeth (Rush).
Demeter is the primary soddess, in the Greek Pantheon, who is associated with the Mother'Earth. I think the dream indicates that the energy has been absorbed by my consciousness and is now available as a perspective from which I can view reality when appropriate.

My dream journey was paralleled by a conscions attempt to understand what the nature and sigalficance of the mother Earth archetype is for contemporary humans. I have elsewhere described what understanding I now have of this archetype, but here is a summary:
'The nurturins and destroying Earth Mother
archetype is the expression of Nature's
ecologic way of being. The mother arche-
type offers the female the security of
continuity embraced, within the principles
of stability and change. This archetype also offers guidance for the self through
a developmental sequance modeled by the Earth
in her processes ranging from fertillity and conception to decay, death and re-birth.
The Earth provides meaning through attention
to the material. Earth mother morality is expressed through the evaluative feelling function: (10)

The dreams I have related point ort a structured process through which the reality of the mother Earth archetype manifested. moving through a process of fragmentation and dacay, death, re-birth, and upport for life, the dreams model the developmental style of the apchetype.

Attentiveness to my own dream stories brought me into a relationshlp with the universal process of the Mother Earth apchetype. Analysis of dreams provides not only insight into one's personal nature, but, the basis for revisioning the Mother Earth archetype and re-establishing a relationship to her culturally.

It is worthwile to consider Walter Otto's warning about the nature of the earthly deities of old: 'Kindly and benevolent to those who remained loyal to them, terrible to any who-whether out of willfulness of necessity-disregarded them, they enclosed the life of the community and the individual by thelp unalterable ordinances."(11) Whether we choose to recognize our relationship to the Earth mother or not, human destiny is 'enclosed within the natural.

The medial principle is necessarily the most anorphous of the female elements. its nature is entirely transpersonal and its function is the mediation of the divine to the individual. The medial is best expressed in the solvent tendencies of the oceanic (depressive, schizoid, dark night of the soul) and in the inspiration of the muse (dream, creative arts, and so on). The medial is the source of intuition, and is sometimes referred to as the void, or chaos.

"I jatred her awake. She hadn't seen me pull off the boulevard down this deserted alley that bordered on the Venice canal, bet she picked up on the scan right off, and liked it, I could tell. She's Phi Beta Kappa, you know, I'd peeked at her resume. Stead there mate, don't twist your ankie. I held her are as she sank to her knees on the littered bank. We pered in silence through the euk, contemplating a rusty bosspring, sone jagged sheetaetal, a jettisoned syringe. All that forlorn detritus beneath the red eorning tide. "Ye've been so profane. This is all so bitter. I infected you, and now it's too late. It's all up for us." I couldn't choke back Dy sobs any longer.
"Prean took strength fron af last minute comardice. She squeared ay hand, looked ae in the oye, and coolly and eventy spoke. "I must go away now," she said. With that, she resorbed her aras, legs, and head, shed her clothing and her skin, and sprouted ten spiny legs and a horny carapace. My tears rained down apon her armour shell. Presa the Horscshoe Crab, I comand the to the deep. I lowered her into the water, and she erept avay ower the rockweed on her new crustacean feet. She grazed upon the benthic life she found while gaking her way out past the breakwater into the open sea.
"Then the fog blew in from the Pacific in heroic, blustering puffs. Fresh, wet, nacreous puifs that scrubbed the diseased stench out of the vicious city, flushed the horrid, rotten gas out of the basin, up through the whithered chaparral canyons, and away, beyond, beyond. I began panting, and with each gasp purged another breath of endo-hatred tron ay lungs to vanish on the tangy marine wind. The first raindrops hissed against the steaming paverent as iy coat caoght a violent gust and I was blown, lighter than heliun, over the spidery telephone lines and rooftops, way up into the heavens.
"The sea mist muted into heartstopping aquamarine blue. I soared ever higher into its midst. Deep, limpid blueness permeated all things: the firmament, the gale, the raging ocean wiles below, and the chilly, bittersweet yearning in the pit of ay soul. The blue wind spirited me far bejond all memory of that grimy world l'd abandoned, sailed me into my exife in a feral, stainiess land, a wolblike reala unsullied by the machinations of human desite.
"Pethaps it was on the Spanish main, a thousand pears ago, on the very edge between the heaving ooean swells and the sizzling lizard-sweiter of the oak savannah. The tempest abated, and I was set down unharmed. A narrow saddie of land separated the brutal surf from a shallow salt pan shimpering with azure mirage. I found myself perched upon a craggy promontory circled by screaming golls. From this vantage point I surveyed the regal prospect without recollection of events gone by. I had been no other, not ever; was alwaps hert, was eternally this first lone man, steward of the sez and the rock and the salt since the genesis of the Drean and of Tiae itself.
"I hiked to the harbor of the sall pan and started the diesel engine of the Caterpiller tractor with my key, and so began a work whose firvit had not been revealed to me. I dag out the salty earth bite by bite until I had ercavated a hole the sire of a quarry. I was doarted by its vastness. Oniy a fragile dam I'd left fron ay digging protected ay lacuma from the ravaging breakers. I was lining my creation with wet kelp, when the ground under py feet convulsed in a seismic fit. A voleano in the nearty Sierra Madre cracked to life, spitting up lava and steam. The floor of Dy excavation was rent by the seirure; the gaping fault neariy engulied ae. The rip spread to the foot of the dike, then nigrated beneath it, leaving the crown whole. All the violence of the mitamed sea rushed in at once, churning and roiling, flooding and upwelling, filling ay lagoon to its limit.
"I sprinted up the side in slow gotion, the viscous sea lapping at my henis the whole tise. Frevaling over the waters, I moented my pronontory onoes more. At the sumit I raised my elenched fists above ay head in the hicratic gesture of life and shouted ing altation to the world.
"Down below, the silt filtered to the botton revealing a caerviean gen of a poot, diapled by the feathery upwelling cerrents, bot as stable and deep as the sool of nature. Out on the bounding high seas, a triendy at ernoon sum shone upon prood ranks of opalesernt thunderheads. The zountainous swells were so treid that I could look into acah nook and cramy of the ocean floor. On it, Prema the Korseshoe Crab mas returning tron her forgotten darkling oddessey. She skittered up the continental slope, souttied zeress the shelf, then over the sand flats. Finally, her sentinal body darted through the breach from the great world bejond into the dointer i'd prepared. "Prema," I oried, and skided reokiessly down the tulves to the water's edga. I sported with her for a while, leaping and skipping to and fro on the shore while she courted in parallel. 1 produced a bag of aagic aushroons fron By pocket and fed her one fion my hand. She nipped of the eap with her razor sharp noothparts.

The setariorphosis was conplete in the blink of an eye. Frema the forseshoe Crab becane Prema the Voman. Glistening find naked, chaste and taintiess, pure and elfulgent, ishe waded to the ghore and took ny hand. Thos linked we asoended the hill to the higheat reach and gare united once more."
