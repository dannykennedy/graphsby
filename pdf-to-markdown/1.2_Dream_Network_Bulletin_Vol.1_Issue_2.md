Most homes have at least one alarm clock. People depend on these external cues to start their days on time. Some people have developed an internal clock, awakening just prior to the alarm's signal. And still a small percentage of others have done away with the alarm clock altogether and can independently awaken themselves.

Lucid dreaming is a more subtle form of awakening - within the dream. Now there are machines which claim to wake us up within the dream. Currently some people have lucid dreams spontaneously and a few others, like Stephen La Berge and his trainees, can induce lucid dreams through a method La Berge developed called "MILD" (Mnemonic induction of Lucid Dreams). The MILD method is based upon motivation, autosuggestion, and memory. Basically, one awakens spon taneously from a dream in the early morning, memorizes the dream, and then engages in some activity that demands full wakefulness for 10 to 15 minutes. Next, while lying in bed and preparing to sleep, one repeats to oneself, "Next time I'm dreaming, I want to remember I'm dreaming." One then visualizes his body asleep in bed dreaming with eves mov ing rapidly. At the same time, one sees himself in the dream just recalled (or any other, should none be recalled upon awakening) and realizing that he's dreaming. The autosuggestion and visualization are repeated until the intention is clearly fixed.

Volunteers are being taught the MILD technique by Stephen La Berge at Stanford $U$, and Joe Dane at $U$. of $V a$. So far, people with high dream recall appear to have the highest degree of success.

But for the majority ("alarm clock peo. ple"), perhaps an external cue, a "dream machine" for example, will serve as an effective means to induce lucid dreams. And perhaps with enough practice with a "dream machine", like the alarm clock, we will anticipate the external signal and have a lucid dream immediately prior to the signal. And eventually, we will outgrow the "dream machine" and may lucid dream at will, just as we will ourselves to awaken at a certain time every morning.

Sounds easy, doesn't it? Perhaps, ultimately, the MILD technique used in conjunction with a dream machine will yield the best results. However, this is purely speculation, for the dream machines have not undergone complete scientific testing as of yet. And although they are not yet available to the public, have chosen to disciose their intended purpose and use.

## Hearne's "Dream Machine"

Dr. Keith Hearne, British psychologist and lucid dream researcher has noted the scarcity of lucid dreams in the laboratory, making his research inefficient. This has motivated him to consider if lucid dreams could be artificially induced by some device.

Since most lucid dreams have been found to occur during REM, Hearne figured that if the subject were alerted during REM, this could induce a lucid dream if the subject were given a presleep suggestion to respond to the signal. Because monitoring rapid eye movements is susceptible to artifacts, Hearne chose to measure breathing rate, which is artifact-free and increases during REM. When a nasal thermistor, clipped to the nostrils, records about 18 or more breaths per minute, it will signal the dream machine to send out a series of four electric shocks to the dreamer's wrist electrodes. The dreamer is forewarned in the waking state that if these shocks occur in the dream, they will be interpreted as the four words, "This is a dream."

The machine's release is being delayed by the manufacturer. When it appears, Hearne hopes to sell it commercially for under $\$ 100$

## DISCOVERING LUCIDITY EXPERIENTIAL EXERCISES FOR DREAM STUDY GROUPS

By Judith R. Malamud, Ph.D.

Here are two exercises that I devised to introduce dream study groups to lucid dreaming, i.e., awareness of dreaming during a dream. Both exercises involve simulation of lucid dreaming in waking fantasy, and exploration of the potentials of lucid awareness for enhancing creativity, self-understanding and satisfaction I think it is probable that if experiential exercises of this type are practiced repeatediy, they may incuce more frequent or more powerful lucid experiences in dreams, and analogously, in waking life.

## Guided Fantasy for a Simulated Lucid Dream

Instructions: Participants make themselves comfortable, lie down, if they wish, close their eyes, relax, breathe deeply and pretend that they are about to go to sleep and have a special kind of dream, a lucid dream. A volunteer reads the "Cuided Fantasy" Slowly, with pauses as indicated. At the end, the reader gent Iy "awakens" the participants and invites them to share their "dreams."

## Guided Fantasy for

## Simulated Lucid Dream

Imagine you are in the middle of a dream....and you realize....that you are dreaming.... You take a look at your surroundings....you are immensely in terested in even the most ordinary details, because you know you are right now creating them....Everything may look very real.... and feel solid to your touch.... you marvel at your own ability to imagine such realistic sensations.... vet if you break a glass here....you know you will not wake up to find the pieces on the floor.

You pick up a glass and strike it with a hammer...It doesn't break-now strange! How could that be? You take a closer look and see that you no longer have a glass in your hand, but something else...that seemed to appear effortlessly, yet you know it is there because you are imagining it. What is it?...What does it look like?.... How does it feel in your hands?.... How do you feel about this experience you have spontaneously given yourself?...Now you wonder whether you could purposely change your object into something you would love to touch, smell or see. You can do it, but only if you believe you can and only if you truiy want to with all your heart and being. Otherwise, you will find that your conscious efforts produce a surprise! Try it!.

you begin to realize you have amazing powers in this special world, and you
want to test them. "Could I even fly?" you wonder. You easily climb the nearest tree, and perching on a high branch, you think about jumping off. "Oh, no!" you think. "What if I crash to the ground? Will I break bones?" Then you remember, "Of course I can't really hurt myself. My body is safe at home in bed....But could I feel pain?" You could indeed, if you chose to imagine pain, but you needn't do that....

You float gently off the branch, above the grass...the buttercups... and the trees...."Wow, I can fly!:...The sensation is wonderful, and you admire the exquisite detail of the changing scenery you are creating all around you.... And then you land on both feet in front of....an animal!....and you take a good look, because you know there must be a reason why you are dreaming up this particular animal. What kind of animal is it?.... What does it look like?... How does it behave toward you?... You know you can learn something about yourself from this animal....and knowing you need not be shy in a dream, you decide to speak to it. "Who are you?" Listen for its answer..."Is there something you want me to know?" What does it say?....And now what do you do?....And what does the animal do?..

And now, you can say goodbye....thank your animal, if you wish.... and remember to thank yourself, too!

## The Lucidity Card Game

Instructions:

1. (Advance preparation.) Before the meeting, a volunteer makes up a deck of "Lucidity Carcs." on each card, the volunteer prints a statement of one of the principles or "laws" of lucidity in the dream state, such as:

"You are the creator of your dream world."

"Since you are not bound by the 'laws' of waking reality, you have unlimited freedom to create anything you can imagine in your dreams."

"Since your dream consists only of images, vou need fear nothing in it."

"Every part of your dream reflects some aspect of yourself and/or your personal way of perceiving vour world

The deck shouid contain at least one card for each member of the group. For example, if the workshop is expected to have 20 participants, the deck could consist of five coples of each of four lucidity statements. You could make up your own lucidity statements, use the four statements above, or use the following more poetic renderings:

"What amazing talents the dream artist has!

How real, how life-like is the creation:

would you like to know how it is done?

observe yourself at work

you breathe sound \& shape, movement \& color into each image of your dream.
You are, You wish

You will,

You choose,

You dream."

"What's stopping you?

Yes the world is full of limits, the outer world, that is.

But dreams are another realm of no impossibles.

You have all the power, skill and wisdom that you can imagine to create the reality you desire."

"Consider how safe you are, lying there, with your eyes closed, sound asleep.

The outer world is not bothering you, and you are not bothering it. So relax and enjoy your dream.

No matter what bloody scenes you might fashion in your mind, the wounds will vanish when you awaken.

Knowing you are truly safe, is there some "risk" you feel like taking?'

"What is in your dream-mirror worid?

You, the envisioner, are the only one there.

But you keep yourself company with your thoughts, your feelings, your images....

Would you like to make friends with yourself?'

2. Form a group of two to five people. If you are working with a large group, ask for several volunteers who would like to work on their dreams, and form subgroups of one to four "Helpers" around each "Dreamer."
3. The Dreamer tells the dream or one part of it) to the Helpers. The Dreamer should be encouraged to include the $\mathrm{im}$ agery, thoughts, and feelings he or she experienced during the dream. The idea is to describe the dream as vividly as possible so the Helpers will be able to imagine experiencing the dream as if it were their own.
4. The Helpers ask the Dreamer questions about the dream until they are satisfied that they have a clear idea of what the Dreamer experienced. Some useful questions for inducing empathy with the Dreamer

"What did he (she) (it) look (sound) (feel) (taste) (smell) like?"

"When that happened, what did you think or feel?"

"Did you have any wish, intention or goal at that point?'

"Were you acting freely, or were you inhibiting yourself?"

"What part of the dream felt the most satisfying, during the dream itself? What made it satisfying?"

"What part felt the least satisfying, during the dream itself? What made it unsatisfying?"

5. The Dreamer and the Helpers make themselves comfortable, close their eyes, pretend they are going to sleep, and take a few minutes to "re-dream" the original dream by imagining themselves in the Dreamer's place, ex- periencing all that she or he experienced, in the very same way, as much as possible.
6. The Dreamer and Helpers share their reactions to experiencing the dream. While comparing experiences, the Helpers should try to check out how their "dreams" and personal reactions were similar to, or different from, the Dreamer's. Since there will always be both similarities and differences, this sharing should increase each person's empathy with the Dreamer, while revealing something about each Helper's uniqueness. Even the Dreamer will experience the dream in a new way, since he or she will have changed since the time of the original dream.
7. The Dreamer and Helpers are each given a different Lucidity Card, so that each person in the group will have a different principle of lucidity to consider. The participants take a few minutes to read their Lucidity Cards and to meditate silently on how the statements they have received could be applied to the original dream.
8. As in step (5), each participant "redreams" the original dream, but this time, the participant should imagine being lucid during the dream and should try to apply the lucidity principle on his or her card. The participant may (but does not have to) change the original dream in order to make the new "dream" more satisfying.
9. After everyone finishes their lucid "re-dreaming," the participants read their Lucidity cards aloud and share their new versions of the "dream." The assortment of new "dreams" will probably highlight several principles of lucidity and a range of approaches to the problems and opportunities posed by the original dream situation. The Dreamer and Helpers can then consider and discuss how these lucidity principles and varied approaches to enhancing satisfaction might have relevance to their individual waking life situations. The "game" could end at this point, or the group might wish to add one more step:
10. (Optional.) If the Dreamer finds that any one of the new lucid "dreams" (or some composite version) feels particularly intriguing, satisfying or insightful, she or he may suggest that the group "bring the 'dream' to life" by acting it out. The Dreamer could play him or herself, take any other role, or just watch, and the Helpers could assist by plaving the other characters in the "dream."

Variation A: As in step (8), the participants lucidly "re-dream" the original dream, but this time, they identify not with the Dreamer, but with another character in the dream. They "re-dream" the dream from that other character's point of view, with the aim of increasing that character's satisfaction. For example, if the original dream had the Dreamer, a princess and a horse in it, each participant would imagine being either the princess or the horse. This variation offers the enrichment of different perspectives on the dream situation and the possibility that the participants may discover surprising new inner potentials.

Lucidicy Techmiques

Variation $B$ : In step (8), the participants pretend that they are entering the dream not as the Dreamer, but as themselves or any other character they choose or invent, for the purpose of offering help or encouragement to the Dreamer. This is a very direct way of conveying caring and support to a Dreamer troubled by a problematic situation.

## Ground Rules to Consider

Participants in experiential groups tend to feel more secure, and perhaps less inhibited, when ground rules to protect individual privacy and the voluntary nature of participation are discussed and adopted by the group. Two such rules are "right to pass" lanyone can choose not to participate in any part of the proceedings) and "confidentiality" (personal revelations of other group members are not discussed with outsiders).

## From Alarm clock to Dream Machine

continued from $p .1$ mistor. An electronic unit will register respiration and the threshold rate, which is the rate above which the unit will trigger. The subject is told that when he is lucid in a dream, he should make a sequence of rapid breaths. This is registered on the thermistor and triggers the operation of an automatic telephone-dialing device. In one of several models, a plastic card drops into a slot causing a number to be dialed. When the 'Agent' receives a call with no one on the line or hears a pre-recorded message, he randomly chooses a picture card and/or a random number and tries to 'send' it to the dreamer. Upon awakening, the subject writes down any dreams.

The equipment is smail, portable, battery-powered, suitable for home experimentation, and is commercially available. For information, write to keith Hearne, 36 Deerhurst Grove, Bransholme, HUII, ENGLAND HUG 7RY.

## Nightmare Interruptor Device

For those of you who suffer from recurring nightmares, Keith Hearne offers another device that will wake you up before the nightmare develops. This is effective only for Stage REM nightmares, which cover the majority of aduit nightmares and are referred to as anxiety dreams. Such nightmares are preceded for several minutes by increased heart rates, respiratory rates, and eve movements. Because of its utility and artifact-free advantage, the nasal ther-

mistor is again employed. As the dreamer becomes tense, the increased breathing rate triggers an alarm causing the subject to awaken and thereby avoid experiencing the full nightmare.

Hearne believes that the device provides a basic reassurance to the dreamer that he can sleep without experiencing the total nightmare. There moreover occurs a therapeutic change of attitude towards sleep and dreaming.

The device's effectiveness is based on the assumption that the nightmare is a "functionless habit which may be eliminated." This belief is partially supported by a behavioral therapy method that worked in one case. Geer and Silverman used desensitization for a subject with recurrent nightmares. By imagining fearful events while simultaneously relaxing and thinking "it's oniy a dream", the subject was able to extinguish the nightmare after 13 sessions. This implies to me that dealing with nightmares while in a lucid dream could be just as effective.

I wonder if by avoiding the experience of nightmares, one may become less adept at dealing with conflicts and stress in waking life, Perhaps it might be more healthy to confront the nightmares rather than avoid them.

As with the other two machines by Hearne, the commercial avallability of the nightmare interruptor is being delayed by the manufacturer

The nightmare interruptor device is small, battery-operated, and simple to set up. For information, write to Keith Hearne, 36 Deerhurst Grove, Branshoime, HUII, ENGLAND HU6 7RY.

THEATER: TWEL VE DREAMS BY

JAMES LAPINE REMINISCENT OF JUNG BY MARGARET SALHA

A gaunt but lissome young girl mesmerizes us with haunting, dark eyes Her fragile, ethereal body disturbs us; we already sense we are dreaming. To set the scene, an eminent Europeanpsychiatrist (suggesting Jung) has narrated the theory of modern psychoanalysis the year is 1936). Gravitating toward our sensitive, unearthly protagonist "Emma:" The familiar characters of her waking life-transposed into bleating, braying animals-converge upon her: the first of a series of twelve dreams in the play Twelve Dreams written and directed by James Lapine.

The enactment of Emma's dreams, woven into the fabric of her waking reality in a cubistic, hall-of-mirror fragmentation and re-creation culminating in her death, is the substance of the play produced in January at the New York Shakespeare Theater.

The disturbing dreams were originally incorporated by Jung in Man and His Symbols to illustrate his thesis that dream symbols are often "archetypes of the collective unconscious," innate metaphors for the cosmic origin and meaning of life, social ritual and death.

The themes of destruction and renaissance do seem to confirm Jung's tenet that Emma's dreams compensate and prepare her for premature death. However, Lapine's implicit premise is that they result from her inability to come to terms with her mother's death (his invention) and are dire warnings to heed the call to life or relinquish it. Does this necessarily preclude Jung's perception of precognitive rumblings? Emma's primordial visions may well surface from the gods/demons lurking in her unconscious, but her "oracle" is still driving to resolve her psychic dilemma.

In the eleventh dream, Emma reaches up to attain the glowing ball-to Jung, the mandala, a representation of completeness-but a saboteur-shadow blocks this attempt and destroys her; in a shadow of stardust in dream twelve she gives up the struggle altogether.

Margaret Salha, writer and critic, will interview James Lapine in an upcoming issue.

## Doubleness

continued from $\mathrm{p} .4$

and checked, as I sometimes, do, to see if the dream person's eyes looked truly "human."

Have other people observed the doubling phenomenon? I have not seen instances of it in the lucid dream literature familiar to me except in the Garfield book as noted above. Is doubling ever a trait of totally non-lucid dreams? is it possible that it connects with some kind of special synchronizàtion-or lack of it?-between the two halves of the brain? or might it have some connection with the sensation of being in both a dream body and a physical one?

When I first read Patricia Garfield's Ecstasy. I was particularly interested by her description of "doubleness" as a
frequent trait of her lucid dreams. "Doubleness is similar to, but not exactwaking state. Immediately prior to the beginning of lucidity I often notice that something is begintring again. In one bout to start over; in another, a story At the time of reading the carfied book, had begun to record my lucid dreams. in some of them I had noted doubleness, not of event, but of image (which also occurs in Garfield's lucid liner and on either sir passage vias a beautiful mellow-honey colored library room, the two rooms on January 30th of this year some people interested in lucid dreams met in $\mathrm{my}$ for a long time.

## Negative Ion Generator

In the last issue of The Dream Neiwork Bulletin was an account by Tom Adler whereby he claimed that the Energaire induced lucid dreams for him. I was able to obtain the same machine from a friend, Bill Middleton, and try the same experiment.

The machine was mounted 6 inches from my head, and using a timer, I set the machine to go on one hour after bedtime so that it would be on for the first REM period. However, I was awakened by the sound of the generator, and as I struggled to return to sleep, I felt a series of electrical charges in my head. visually I experienced some flashing lights. When these sensations subsided, 1 felt a slight headache and aches throughout $m y$ arms and legs. The machine ran all night in my hope of catching some later and longer REM periods and perhaps a lucid dream. No success. While the machine was on, I experienced a feeling of restlessness, tossing and turning frequently. Unable to relax completely, 1 awoke the next morning physically strained though mentally alert.

Hoping that I was merely experiencing a "first night effect", the same procedure was repeated for several nights but delaying the machine's onset to $4: 30$ A.M. I hoped to get enough stage 4 sleep rest and also to focus the negative ions on the longer REM periods.

## Interview with Stephen coldin

$$
\text { conimued from p. } 8
$$

Shute: Well, she could plan to finish that novel, to induce a dream.... So she gets her inspira. tion from a dream.

coldin: Yes, a lot of her books come, not from dreams, but in a state of semiwakefullness, right in the morning. It's like a movie going on in her head. When she wakes up, she writes not the movie, but her impressions of the movie that she saw. And that's how she gets her ideas. One
thing that fascinates me about dreams is their imagery, which is whyl love surrealist their imagery, which is why love surrealist
art. The surrealists...try to capture their dreams. They were trying to contact that element deep within their minds and put it onto canvas.

Shute: Verv interesting. Back to your book. The FCC has a rule to restrict dreaming to nighttime hours to keep it from becoming too addictive. This reminds me of soap operas today. What does this sav about your attitude towards naps?

Goldin: Itm not biased about naps - I take them myself. I just felt that....It would be very tempting for the weaker types who couldn't face reality...to tune in 24 hours a day. The FCC wanted to prevent
psychiatric breakdowns. So they made this rule like many rules; the government is purely arbitrary.

Shute: I see. In the baok vou also say that there's no real feeling of pain in the dream. Would that be controlled also through electromagnetic waves, somenow, repressing the pain centers?

Goldin: The Dreamers weren't allowed to broadcast pain in the dream. The vlewer has to feel the impact without the pain. And this is why it is so horrlfying later when they go into Vince's dream and they are torturing all those poor women. The pain is very real for them.

Shute: Vince makes them feel the pain out of his own needs?

coldin: He fust doesn't block the pain and it's up to them whether they feel it or not, and be. cause they feel this is the real world. they're feeling it.

On the second night I awakened immediately prior to the machine's going off. Finally l'd adjusted to the machine and slept through the night. Still, I had not experienced a single lucid dream.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_30_82390d4a66e29d10287cg-5.jpg?height=30&width=27&top_left_y=1309&top_left_x=767)

Shute: How would you relate this to lucld How would
dreaming?

Goldin: What the Dreamers....are doing is lucid dreaming. They would be the ones indreaming. The the dream broadcast industry....and creating oreams for other people....The people who shaw the most talent in lucla dreaming would be the ones who get the training.

Shute: Any bevond that, to be able to project dreams to the people, wouldn't people with psychic abilities also make good Dreamers?

Goldin: Quite definitely - you have to be able to project vour thoughts outwardiv.

Shute: Do you think that eventualiy psychic phenomena will be reduced to electromagnetic terms?

Goldin: I think that's pretty much what it will come down to. There's so much about the brain
that we don't know. Somehow the electhat we don't know. Somehow the elec-
trical synapses between the varlous neurons have different properties. Some flow more easily than others.... (i) belleve) psychic phenomena can be explained in terms of electrical charges in the brain. I am a great believer that there is a supernatural.

Shute: You wrote in your letter to me that you believe in almost no limits on dreams. What limits do you see?

Coldin: I don't belleve that the future is predestined. People who have dreams that they claim can absolutely predict the future....may see things that are possible futures. I don't think they can predict absolutely $100 \%$.

Shute: Are there any other limitations?

Goldin: I think it would be difficult for somebody to visualize something totally alien to thelr entire experience. All dreams seem to be collections of images from your mind that have generally already happened. A per. son who has a more limited life would probably have more limited dreams as opposed to a person who has been around the wiorld and has seen a lot of plctures...

Why did it work for Tom Adler and not for me? Perhaps I'm too light a sleeper. Had I not awakened for the first night, the electrical charges and visual flashes might have set off a lucid dream. However, two cases alone will not prove nor disprove the theory that negative ions do induce lucid dreams. Further research needs to be done. Anyone else who has tried the negative ion generator can write to me.

Over the past couple of decades, various dream interpretation techniques have developed. Parallel to this developement is the growth of scientific research in sleep and dreams.

Lucid dreaming, one particular type of dreaming, has recently gained extensive public attention. In the past couple of months alone, the T.V. program "Discover" has devoted a segment to the research being done by stephen La Berge and keith Hearne and WMCA radio in N.Y.C. has interviewed Douglas Colligan, $\mathrm{Sr}$. Editor of OMNI, about lucid dreaming (article in March, OMNII, citing La Berge, Hearne, and Malamud.

Anyone who has had lucid dreams can understancl why they are so special. Not only can one communicate to an out. sider that one is having a lucid dream (eve movement, respiration, wrist move ment), but there are "dream machines" (Hearne's) and special techniques (La Berge's MLD) that mav induce lucid dreams. With the introduction of consciousness into a dream, which is characteristic of lucid dreaming, one has the advantages of (1) greater communica. tion with different levels of oneself, (2) greater openness to psychic experiences, (3) greater pleasures and adventures in dreams, and (4) a greater mastery and understanding of oneself and the world.

The potentials of lucid dreaming seem limitless, yet most of us would like to achieve something more through lucid dreaming: have more frequent lucid

dreams, use lucid dreams for a particular purpose (healing, decision-making, etc.), increase self-understanding, try out new life styles or modes of behavior, or explore the nature of lucid dreaming.

I believe that the sharing and exchange of ideas in groups and through a newsletter will accellerate our understanding of lucid dreaming. Hence came the idea of study groups.

I encourage those of you who are interested to fill out the questionnaire that follows. The questions are designed to assess your area of interest and qualifications as a study group leader. If you seem qualified to lead a group, you will be sent a list of names of people in your area to contact. Groups will be set up on the basis of area of interest and geographical convenience. For those groups engaged in discussions, exercises, and projects, some structure will be offered through the newsletter and forms summarizing your findings will be sent to you, and returned in completed form to 'Lucidity and Beyond'.

Until the study groups are formed, we have an exercise for you to try. Keith Hearne, Ph.D., is currently investigating the following aspects of lucid dreaming and is interested in knowing about your success or failure in carrying them out at will in a lucid dream:

1. Switching on a light
2. Switching on a different device
3. Covering your eyes and willing yourself to a particular place

Mark Thurston's Vision

by Sally $A$. Shute

The following is a paragraph from the chapter on lucid dreaming from Visions and Prophesies for a New Age, a new book written by Mark Thurston

"The introduction of free will ... is not without its dangers and temptations. Nearly everyone who has had lucid dreams has experienced manipulating the dream - that is, using free will in conjunction with the creative powers of mind to change the dream. For example, one option available to us as lucid dreamers is to change with our desires and thoughts that threatening animal into a beautiful woman or a handsome man. However, this is a procedure that should be avoided if we are to make the best use of the special opporturity which a lucid dream provides. It is far better to use the will to change our own response to the original dream content from that of fear to that of love. What we may find is that the dream symbols and events then begin to change as we first alter our reactions. Resisting the temptation to manipulate or concoct dream images allows the integrity of the dream process to be maintained. That process is often being directed by higher levels of mind which see the necessity for certain scary or uncomfortable events or images to be confronted".

The entire chapter will be explored in depth in the next 'Lucidity and Beyond' issue in July. For now, we'd like your responses to the above passage. For your reactions to be included in the next issue, send to: 'Lucidity \& Beyond', P.O. Box 746, Maywood, N.J. 07607. (Deadline is May 15.)

Also, Mark Thurston would like to hear from those of you who may be interested in on-going, home-study research with lucid dreaming. Write to him: Mark Thurston, c/o A.R.E., Box 595, Virginia Beach, VA 23451

## Stephen Goldin <br> SCIENCE FICTION: <br> Dreams of Possible Futures

By Sally $A$. Shute

Many people view science fiction as pure fantasy, as an indulgence in imagination. But weren't science fiction authors writing about man traveling to the moon years before it was conceived of as even possible? Don't fine artists often have a gift for being ahead of their time, being more appreciated vears after their death?

I view science fiction as a possible view of the future. For this science fiction book review and for those to follow in upcoming issues, our main concern will be: "Considering what we know now to be true, what aspects of those described have a strong possibility of coming true?"

Beyond Lucid Dreaming:

Controlling the Dreams of Others

Goldin, Stephen. AND NOT MAKE

DREAMS YOUR MASTER. N. Y.:

Fancei Gold Medal Books, 1981.

Wayne Corrigan and Janet Meyers are Dreamers for a company, Dramatic Dreams. They memorize a script and prepare to act it out in their dreams. Keeping to the schedule of the home program guide to the dream broadcast industry, Wayne and Janet place their dreamcaps on their heads. When asleep the images created by the Dreamers are amplified and transmitted electromag. netically to the viewers' home dream. caps. The viewers set their dial to tune in to the drama and identify with the characters portrayed by either wayne or Janet.

Vince Rondel is a Masterdreamer, who can create a number of different roles for the audience to identify with. The viewer, however, has no free will, being under the control of the Dreamer. The viewer in the dream state believes these experiences to be real. It's no wonder that the Federal communications commission places many restrictions on the dream broadcast industry to prevent the possible dangers of the Dreamers loss of control - imagine the effects on the audience....
Shute: Stephen, of your many science fiction books, what inspired you to write a book books, what ins
about dreams?

coldin: I had heard a story about a psychlatrist who was able to go Into somebody's creams and help save him, which brought an idea to my mind What a scary possibll ty it would be if someone could control other peoples' dreams and take them out of control....and how you could change that around to hurting people. It came from Roger Zelazny's THE DREAM MASTER and a story someone told me from "Analogues".

Shute: Assuming that science fiction has some basis in fact. let's try to separate the fact from the fiction. It's been shown that most dreaming cccurs in REM sleep in about 90 minute cycles. In your book people tune in to a program at a specific time regardless of their sleep stage. Were you implying that some day our sleep cycles could be externally manipulated?

Goldin: Because I didn't delve specifically into the nature of the dream cap, it might be nature of the dream cap it might be
assumed that they could induce a REM sleep. you know how people can generate alpha waves by thinking about it. So possibly an external force might induce REM sleep.

Shute: Your programs are 14 minute acts with breaks. How did you choose this time frame, and what happens in the viewers minds during these breaks?

Goldin: $\quad$ chose the 14 minute period because it would be like television acts with commer cials. During the breaks you'd have the deeper sleep, the generally dreantess sleed, and more or less a rest like we do naturally in different periods of time.

Shute: You wrote that the same images are stored in the same places within peoples brains.

Goldin: There is a lot being explored now. There are general areas that are similar among people, pleasure zones for instance. I presumed that they would be able to pinpoint things a little more carefully.

Shute: And doing it by computer, which was interesting.

Goldin: It wouldn't be exactly the same images, like for instance, I say the word 'chair'.... would be visualizing a kitchen chair and you might be visualizing an arm chair.

Shute: So if the Dreamers had a certain scheme for the dream, people could be viewing this in different ways.

Coldin: Within certain limitations, the Dreamer would try to be as specific as possible. But imagine there would be slight variations for each viewer... different interpreta tions of it.
How did you choose electromagnetic stimulation of the brain rather than elec. trodes in transmitting dreams?

If you're going to have a big industry, you wouldn't want to have everybody go for electrode implants.... You would have to do it so that it would be accepted by the audience.

shute How could electromagnetic waves serve this function?

Goldin: We know that the basis of radar is that the rays could go into something and there's ravs could go into something and theres
some materials that are reflective to the radar waves. You could put meat on a paper plate in a radar oven. The plate is totally unchanged, but the meat gets heated up. So what i figured is that these waves would go inside and be broadcast, especially being broadcast at a very specific area, and those areas get stimulated and the areas around them get nothing.

Shute: That's a verv interesting concept. in your book vou've presented the masses as a group of people who lack imagination to create their own dreams. Who would you envision those masses to be tocay?

Goldin: It would be a group of people who sit in front of the T.V. and turn it on and completely turn off their minds. They're not reacting to the world around them even in their waking lives.

Shute: And the dreamers you describe as endur. ing reality, and that their reat life lay in dreams. Who would these people be to. day?

Goldin: Actors, painters, generally the creative people... What i was postulating in the book is that to be able to be a Dreamer is the ultinlate way of communicating. There is no medium verween you and the audience in communicating....directly from one mind to the other. so at the end the punishment that vince will never be able to broadcast a dream again is the most horrible punishment that any Dreamer can have.

Shute: One of the rules in vour book stressed that dreams not be cut off before they're over or you'll be frustrated. Do you believe this is true in working with dreams currentiy? If an alarm clock awakens you in the middie of a dream, sometimes you're frustrated about the incompleteness.

Goldin: I know that's happened to me at times. And I can give you one very specific example: what happened to my wife, who's also a writer she'd been having a series of nightmares she started making noise at night so I woke her up. she had been night, so I woke her up. She had been dreaming the plot of a novel and had got ten about 6 or 7 chapters into it. It was starting to be really good and then I woke her up, and she doesn't know how it ends.
