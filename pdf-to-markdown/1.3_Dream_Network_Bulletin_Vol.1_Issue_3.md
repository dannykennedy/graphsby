## PLEASURE DREAMS <br> By Jenny Davidow, M.A.

jump into the air and fly - feel the cool night air caressing your skin and blowing through your hair. Explore an exotic forest of giant flowers whose colors are llke none you have ever seen before. Walk with your inner guide and learn the deepest meanings of life. Or join in sensual embrace with your aream lover, culminating in ecstatic union.

in the dream world, everything is permitted: This is a special place where we have everything to gain by going past the normal assumptions and social restraints that apply in waking life. We need to give ourselves permisssion to seek the limits of pleasure here. Dream enemies can be killed if necessary and transformed into friends; we can be impulsive, angry, tender, creative, sexual, and mystical - and there is no risk of harming anyone. in my aream classes, I use guided fantasy to apply the same princlples of dream control developed by the Senoi tribe. By redreaming a dream in the waking state so it is more pleasurable and self-affirming, we consciousty realize the choices and potentials available. Dreamers often feel an energy rush as they transform nightmares and unsatisfying dreams into exciting adventures.

Following my methods, dreamers soon discover that the flip side of every nightmare symbol is a power symbol - one that inspires us with confidence and energy in the direction we presentty need to grow. Even without dreaming lucidly, the dreamer's new awareness and selfpermission have a powerful impact. Dreams progressively become more positive and pleasurable

Often it is difficult for dreamers to choose and create a pleasurable adventure, when they habitually undervalue their own worth - and their creative magic. Recently, one of my students dreamed she was at a party: She stands there feeling ignored and rejected. She is overcome by a terrible sensation of not belonging and despair of ever finding the right love relationship.

Parties, banquets, gifts, singing, dancing, flying, and sexual union can all symbolize celebration of one's own life - loving oneself. The key problem in my student's dream was that she did not feel she belonged - she was cut off from the oleasure and self-acceptance the party represented

In creating her fantasy, she altere the original dream so that it was now her party in a large, beautiful house: Her friends are there eating and dancing, and they are appreciative for having a good time. This change represented a positive step, but was not enough. The essential issue remained: How can she create a feeling of belonging in her fantasy? continued on page 2

LUCID DREAMS AS<br>METACHORIC EXPERIENCES<br>BY Celia Green, B.Litt., M.A<br>Director, institue of Psychophysical Research<br>Oxford, Engtand

The institute of Psychophysical Research was founded in 1961 to study among other things those phenomena which are currently regarded a 'paranormal', or inexplicable by contemporary science.

Over the years the institute has made a particular study of what we have called 'metachoric experiences' that is to say experlences in which the subject's environment is completely replaced by a hallucinatory one.

The first type of metachoric experience that we studied was lucid dreams, or dreams in which the subject is aware that he is dreaming. the following is an example taken from my book on the subject (Lucid Dreams, 1968)

Without uny drefiminary ordinury dream experience. suddenly found myself on a fairly large bout rravelling at a nurmal speed hip) whut appeared to be the mouth of a river just before in iswes into) the sell. There was some sort of plousthts scenerv on either side, with trees and greenery, und struight in fromt, the waler stretched to infinily. The deck was smooth und clean and warmed by the sum, and fell the warm breeze on my skim. This sturtlet me, bectuse I knew that in a dream one aies not feel acitual physical sensations with the sume intensity ant sutbletv as in real life, and I was sufficiently mistress of iny own thought and movements to pincti my arm in order to ussure myself tha it was only a dreaut. I fell the flesh under my fingers and the slight puin in my arm, und this filled the with real uiurm, becuese I knew that lought not to be on that boat in the day/ight. I did not see my own body, but। I was sufficiently /ucid to imagine it, lying inert in mo own bed here in Paris. (Lucid Dreams, P. 15)

Once someone has realized he is dreaming he may find he is able to influence the course or content of his dream to some extent. For exam ple, he may find that he is able to fly by flapping his arms, or just by willing the armchair in which he is sitting to take off an carry him in whichever direction he wishes to go

some of our subjects have used this aspect of lucld dreaming to attempt experiments in extra sensory perception during the dream state. Thus they may attempt to 'travel' to some dis tant place and attempt to give a message to so meone they know there, or derive some infor mation concerning the friend's environment which they can later check for accuracy on waking up.

Another form of concrol which certaln subects have tried to develop is the production of what would be regarded as psycho-kinetic phenomena if they occurred in waking life. For example, the dreamer may try to move 'physical' objects at a distance in his dream, or make objects materialize out of nothing. The following extract from a lucld dream reported

by one of our subjects will illustrate the kind of experiment that is possible:

1 found myself arriving at a coffee-parly in a cerlain rooin where three or four other people were present ... I uccepted a cup of coffee from one of the people. Next begun to wonder whether $i$ could do uny physiccll phenomena and I started to point at various items of crockery, e.g. a plure. They disuppeared and reappeared simultuneously a yurd or so away. After the first altempt or so I noticed a sinall spray of golden flushes coming from iny finger-tip as I tried to do this. However, my success was not a hundred per cent, and finally l poinred al a bug of sugar. Instead of vanishing, a sort of hole begun to be formed through it, as if made by a rough kind of invisible drill, and the stigur began to nin out of the rugged paper-hole. This was not what I wanted und I went on pointing at it hoping it would slill move or vanish, b"t all that happened was that the hole went on becoming deeper. Lucid breams, pp. 106-7

An aspect of lucid dreaming of particular interest is the so-called 'false awakening', in which the subject belleves he wakes from a lucid or even non-lucid dream, when in fact he is still dreaming. The following is an example of a faise awakening which was reported to us by an American correspondent following the publica tion of my book Lueid Dreams.

Yesierday morning $I$ was areaming ana knew I was dreauning because / could walk on the wall, and the door frame was crooked. Anyway, after dreaming awhile / remembered reading in your book that if one says their own name in à dream, thät they will wake iup. Consequently I said my first maine three times and slow/y sturred to wake up. I was a litlle dizzy because I stood up 100 fast, and had trouble walking because tny 'font was asleep'
PERSONAL MYTHS AND DREAN INTERPRETATION

A. David Feinstein and Stanley Krippner
Bring to mind how different life seemed when you were younger? Your prespective on the world, your beliefs about what you could accomplish, your sense of what was important may have all transformed as you have developed. Reflection on these changes brings into focus the aspect of mental life that has been termed personal mythology. This concept is useful for assisting individuats in keeping their consciousness attuned to the unending demands made upon it by a rapidly changing world and by the ongoing psychological dilemmas life presents.

Personal myths are complex internal structures that determine how we experience the world. A personal mythology is an individuat's everchanging system of complimentary and conflicting personal myths, and it provides the wider context which shapes perceptions thoughts, and ultimately actions. The models we carry in our heads influence every possibility we see and every choice we make, and these inter nalized models are products of our persona mythology. They are more than self-concept more than scripts, and more than value-systmes dynamically addressing each of these fundamental questions of identity: "Who am I ? (self-concept; "Where am I going?" (scripting) and "Why?" (beliefs and values). They govern our perceptions, our cognitions, and thus our behavior

Mythology has been seen as a venerable source of psychological guidance in the com plex choices faced by human beings across cultures and throughout time. The history of this anclent concept is sald to provide a record of the development of human consciousness. Mythology stands on the recognitlon that our notions about the world are, in fact, not fact, but an interplay of perceptions and culturallyinfluenced internal models for interpreting those perceptions. A myth is not a falsehood but a way of interpreting reality that may ultimately be judgedias being functional or dysfunctiona for an individual's wholesome development at a particular point in time. The logic found in mythologies throughout cultures throughout time is perhaps the closest reflection in existence of the complex workings of the human mind. Revitalizing the deep significance of this powerful, ancient concept is particularly appropriate at this point in history because it enhances the vitality of our psychological explanations while reflecting the hypothetical nature inherent in any construct of reality

What is a personal myth? is it a story? is it a personal life style? is it an attitude? it is not identical to any of these, yet it is at the core of each of them. Each is a reflection of an underiying personal myth. A personal myth is a schema, a template, a colored lens through which we see our worid and our role in it, a cookie-cutter through which we stamp out our own version of reality from the undifferentiated cosmic dough.

(cominon expression for pressure on nerves from lying on arins or legs wrong). I knew I was no longer dreaining because I could no longer walk on the wall and the door fraine was straight. I went ot the front door and found a note saying that the police would return some stolen goots that afternoon. (There had been prowlers in the neighborhood the past week.) The note w'as very sloppy and hud poor grammar. I went into the bedroom and found the stolen itins were still rhere, and much to my suprise, I awoke. It took another minute to straighen things out in iny mind.

The phiosophical implications of such experiences have been discussed by my colleague

Chartes Mccreery in his book P
Phenomena and the Physlcal word.

In 1966 we launchea an appeal by means of the Press and radlo for a second type of metachoric experience, which appears to be closely realted to lucid dreams, namely 'out-ofthe-body experiences', In which the subject seems to leave his physical body and see it from outside. We collected some four hunared cases of this tvpe, and these formed the subject matter of my second book out-of-the-Body Experiences, which was published in 1968

The following is an example of the type of experience that was reported to us. The writer in this case was a lady living in oxford.

I was working as a w'ailress in a local restaurum' whd hud just finished a 12 hour stim. I was terribly farigued and was chugrined to find I had lost the lust bus... Howeder| started walking as in those dluys I lived in Jerichto, afificen minute walk at most. I remember feeling so furigued |/wu| | wondered if I'd make it and resolved to myself /hu' l'd 'got to keep going'. At this time l. wus where the Pluvitruse is toduy. The next I registered, was of hearing the simml of my heels very hollowly und I looked down and watched myself walk round the bend of Beaumon St. imo, Hilton Si. I-the bit of me that counts - was up on w lext with Worcester College chapel. I saw' myself very clearty ii whes a summer evening and I was wearing a steè veless shim! wime dress. I remember thinking 'so that's how / look "', 1 ")
peoplc'. 'Out-of-the-Body Experlences, p. 19) A number of our subjects nave triea travelling in the ecsomatic (out-of-the-body) state in order to try and obtain information about distant situations in the real world. For example one of our subjects 'willed' herself to travel some two hundred miles, to visit a theatre in her home town where she knew there was a production in which she was interested immedlately the desire occurred I was "there" she writes, 'in the foyer of the theatre, and drifshe towards the corridor which / knew led to the auditorium. To my surprise, evervthing ap peared to be "wrong way round". the stalls corridor was on the wrong side of the foyer, and the stage the wrong end of the auditorium, as I remember it

II drifted some feet above the heads of the audience, in an upright position (and obviously invisible) and was able quite clearly to see and hear the play which was proceeding on the stage. A significant point is that l am rather deaf and could never, in the body, have heard stage dlalogue without my hearing-aid; nor could I have seen so perfectly without my glasses. Despite the absence of both these artificial aids, i found no difficulty whatever in seeing and hearing perfectIy.' lout-of-the-Body Experlences, p. 129)

This case illustrates how the apparently realistic visual representation of a scene percelved during an out-of-the-body experience may contain unrealistic elements (in this case the positioning of the contents of the theatre with respect to each other). This natura! Iy suggests that the experience is hallucinatory, though of course this does not preclude the possibility that Items of information obtained by some hypothetical process which we may call extrasensory perception have become incorporated into the hallucinatory experience.

A relatively small number of our subjects have also attempted what one might call ex periments in psycho-kinesels in the ecsomatic state. That is to say, they have attempted to move the objects they saw in their environment. The following is one of the few cases of this kind reported to us:

I dreamed that I arose from bed, in my own body, but a weightless form of it. Somehow, 1 managed to ger downstairs, but had great difficully in keeping myself from bumping the ceiling!,.. However, I was determined to prove that I had actually been downstairs when 'awoke', and seeing a vase of anemones on a side-board, which was higher than the table, and therefore easier to reach, I was able to stretch down my foot as I 'few' past, and grasp a blue anemone between my toes, bul as I mov ed away it fell on to the floor, and I could not reach it. memorized the color of the flower, and also noticed a green light coming from a mirror on the wall, for which I could not account. I then experienced a very nasty sensation of 'snapping back' into myself, which made me feel quite ill for a moment ... I awoke at my usual time, and rushed downstairs for evidence of the episode. I saw tha the green light was coming from the window, the dayligh through the drawn green curtains. There are also lights on at the hospital opposite, during the night which could have had the same effect. The mirror is directly opposite the window, so would have reflected it. I have never noticed this before. As to the flower, I could find none, and also remembered that I never have anemones in the room because they clash with the color scheme. Rather disap , pointed, I put it out of my mind, and walked into my landlady's room opposite, to prepare her breakfast, as she was still asleep. As I crossed the center, I trod on something soff. Looking down, I saw that it was a blu anemone! Quite a distance away was a vase of anemones, of different hue, on a high sideboard. My friend obviously did not recall dropping the flower, and her decision to leave them in the kitchen was an oversight, as it is much too hot in there ... (Out-of-the-Body Experiences, 150. $156-7)$

of course psycho-kinesis is not the only possible explanation of this incident. The subject's landlady confirms the Incident of the anemone, saying, 'On another occasion I found a blue anemone on the floor about which she had dreamt ... However, it is possible that the landlady had dropped the ane

dent, without being aware of it.
The subject asserts that she had not seen the flower on the floor before finding it there in the morning: Even If she is not mistaken about this, the possibility remains that she might have acquired the information concerning its position by extra-sensory means.

The third main type of experience which we have studled is that of percelving an apparition or someone or something that is 'not really there' (apparitions of objects as well as people are sometimes reported to us). The following case taken from the book, Apparitions which I co-wrote with my colleague charies McCreery, will illustrate one kind of case.

1 work in a mill, one night on returning home 1 had a feeling of slight tummy upset and headache. I decided to have an early night in bed. I put my husband's dinner in the gas oven on a low light to be ready about ten o'clock when he came home. I went out to the coal bunker and banked the fire up also. Then I retired to bed. I must have slept about three hours when I wakened up suddenty to see my 'dead' Grandfather stood by my bedside. He had his back to me, ard was looking over his shoulder at me. I could see everyiting else in the room. It did not appear to be a dream. I could see plainly his snow-white hair just hanging over the top of his macintosh. I could see the wrinkles on the cloth as he stood there. Just looking at me he looked so real I eventually stretched out my hand to touch him, and, immediately the apparition slowly sort of broke up and melted away. I was dumbfounded. Why, asked myself, should I 'see' my Grandfather when he had been dead so long ago. My mother had died so much more recently. Thoroughly awakened now by this unexplained happening I decided lo go down and take a look at the dinner in the oven. As I went downstairs and opened the door at the bottom I gasped. The house reeked of gas. I can oly assume that when I went for the coal, on shutting the gack door the draft had blown the gas out. I have always thowght since that somehow he canre to warm me. It puzzted me so much as to why it should have been Grandfather I saw, when I had not seen him since I was a girl of fiffeen. I was then forty seven. He looked so really alive, although he did not speak. I could not smell gas until I wem downstairs, (Apparitions, pD. 77-8)

It is perhaps not so obvious why we should be inclined to regard the whole environment as hallucinatory during an experience such as this, and not just the figure of the grandfather. However, we give in our book a number of reasons for regarding this as a possibility, together with a considerable number of cases the discussion of which sheds interesting light on the question.

currently the institute is planning an in vestigation of spontaneous physica phenomena of an apparently inexpircable kind or what one might call real-Iife equivatents of the 'psychokinetic' phenomena referred to
above. It is posssible that our eariler studles of various forms of metachoric experience may heip to shed some light on cases of apparent PK in ordinary life.

If any reader of this newsietter has an experience of this kind which they are willing to describe in writing we should be very pleased to dear from them. The address to which to write is 118 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 6JU, England. The Institue is also still collecting examples of metachoric experiences of the kinds discussed metachoric exp if any reader has had an experience or experiences which fall into any of these categories we should be pleased to receive accounts of them, including accounts of lucid dreams and false awakenings.

1 might add that we are also interested in hear. ing from people who might like to consider moving to oxford to work in association with us. if people are interested in joining us we usually if peopie angest that they come and live in oxford, supporting themselves in the first instance. Work ing with us in their spare time enables us to get to know them better and eventually, if they want to joln us permanentiv, it would probably be possible for us to work out a way of supporting them. Persons of student age might like to consider taking a vacation job near us nere in $0 x$ consider taking vact
ford so that they could work with us in their spare time.

To heip her, I suggested: "What gifts do your friends give you?" Half-kidding, she said, "A man. He jumps out of the cake." Fantasies are meant to be fantastic, whimsical, and mythical so even though we were laughing, I wanted her to stay with this image

"How is he dressed when he jumps out?" She described everyday clothing. She was still afraid of letting her imagination go, giving herself permission to enjoy this dream. I said mischievousIy, "But you have the whole wardrobe at MGM at your disposal! Take something from there." Instantiv her eves lit up happily. Sne chose olivier's costume for Hamlet - garments fitting for her dream prince. She and her lover went together into the garden, and later they made love. Dreams are the language of metaphor. They provide us the opportunity to "awaken", with profound pleasure to our mvriad aspects and potentials. When we make love, we are actuallv loving ourselves. I have had quite a variety of dream lovers - men, women, giants, animals and with each union' i have awakened more able to love and integrate my own masculine and ag. gressive energies, my feminie and nurturing qualities, my creative power, my instincts and sexuality.

Before her fantasy, my student had been crying and felt stuck in a self-defeating pattern. Afterwards, she looked centered and radiant. I
asked her."What gift does your dream lover glve you?" She said: Acceptance. She now felt she betonged. Through her dream lover, she had experienced the pleasure of loving herself more fully.

## THE DREAMS OF A MASTER

by William R. Stimson, Ph.D.

De Chirico's paintings come from dimensions of awareness that our kinds of understanding are only imperfect derivatives of. Yet the paintings speak to us, loudly, deeply. They mysteriouysly transport us to nuances of comprehension not readily grasped or expressed in the ways we have been schooled to be limited to. In this sense they are not unlike our own dreams. Could this be because they are our own dreams? I think so. The visions that de chirico was able to express with such genius on canvas are not unique to him. it is our own deepest stirrings that he has brought before us. His paintings are mirrors of our own minds and souls, How much we can see in them is contingent upon how well we can know what is happening in ourselves. So they may convey quite different messages to different individuals, depending on how far along on the path to self-realization each is. Which message is real? of course it's the one you feel the strongest that's most real for you.

In our commercial culture art is mistakenly confused with the objects produced by artists Nothing could be farther from the truth. Art is a mode of perception. The objects or paintings themselves are only ancillary. Yet they are essential to the process just as it is essential for me to put my impressions of these paintings into writing. Anything I can say about de Chirico's paintings is only what some part of me already knows but putting it into words liberates me by bringing this awareness to areas of my mind that aren't privy to this kind of knowing and thus causing them to release their restrictive hold on my natural unfolding. Sounds like working with dreams? It is.

Let me emphasize that I know nothing of de Chirico, nothing of painting, and certainly nothing of art criticism. It's the ways we have been taught to approach the art of the masters that kill the process in us all. I am fortunately unburdened by these. The three paintings I have chosen to write about are done scant justice by the photographs reproduced here. De Chirico's paintings don't work in black and white. To miss the coior is to miss the meaning. But color pain tings are prohibitively expensive to reproduce accurately. These black and white pictures of his paintings still convey the sense of something, like dimiy remembered dreams, but that "something" itself is gone. I urge our readers to attend this spectacular exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. What this man is saying on canvas and what dreamwork is about are the same thing.

## The $\mathrm{Jc}$ of Return

We live in a world of gray facades flying their black sperm flags of a false fertility, but they are no longer anvthing but facades. We can see through them, especially at the top. The machines has becomes the center of our world. We are alone, colorless, going to the somewhere that is nowhere to go. But there is a light behind the machine, there is something dawning behind the facades. There is a hope behind all of this bleakness. We can see through all this, we know there is something brighter; the dawning of a post-industrial mentality. The man's head isn't on straight. He is each of us. De Chirico entitles this painting "The Jov of Return". What is returning is the light in the sky. It's dawn. It heralds the end of the night that our kind of consciousness and civilization has been for the human soul. It announces the dawn of a new age, a new way of being.

## The seer

Creativity is the key. The maker is the made. The artist is the work of art, sitting squarely on his pedestal. It is himself that he is working on. Self-tailored, still incompletely formed: a human, vet a dummy. How deformed are we who create, how powerless of limb. Yet how beautiful, erect, noble. How dead our heads are: deaf and dumb and blind to the inner vision that is burning brightly within us like a star, Could it be that we have to let go of all that our senses have been trained to see and hear and taste, and all that our arms and hands have been trained to touch and feel? Certainly these trained systems are like so many trained monkeys seeing only what they have been taught. Relinquishing all that, we feel a different kind of sight emerging within us. We become the seer. The eve we see with is inside of us. It is the third eve, the eve of enlightened vision. This painting shows our predicament as creators. We have distanced ourselves from our blackboard of mentalicontructs, and even more so from the massive structure of our civilization. We are in a bare room that is no room at all but opens out into the infinite. It's only out of this emptiness that a new world can be born. Only by owning our creativity will the new human emerge within each of us.

## The Transformed Dream

An exploration of nuance and mood is what this painter's work is all about, the nuance of subtle metaphysical perception, the stuff of dreams brought to waking perception. The

substance but become transformed when we open up to the continued unfolding of this dream which places its precious bounty on the altar of the reality that we worship and is its only legitimate compliment. Our world - that empty parade of forms like the ruins of some dead civilization - becomes transformed. To dream and to become: only this will populate our world with the life that is the most precious and exotic food for our souls. Only this makes everything else beautiful and fitting. Only this brings life in to what all around us is dead.

If art such as de chirico's is invaluable it is only because it brings us closer to what is happening within us all. His genius mirrors our own. We can't all be great painters like him but we are allves, every one of us - great dreamers. And each of us, to do justice to this great dream emerging from within us, must struggle to find his own ways to bring it to the light of day as de Chirico did. Only in this way, and in no other, can we save a world that has grown dead and gray.

THE TRANSFORMED DREAM by Giorgio de Chirico. Reproduced with permission of the St. Louis Art Reproduced

dream we are living is our culture - the heritage of past knowledge, the remains of the great men and thinkers. This dead dream of industrialized architecture that the thinking mind has constructed all around us is transformed with the more delicate substance that comes from within us, not just from night dreams but from altered states of perception that move from them into our waking life - ephemeral things, these modalities, luscious and fresh like a banana, bountiful and ripe like a whole copious stalk of bananas, aromatic and delicious like the prickly pineapple with its teasing promise of sweetness. The past we've contructed all around us is transformed by these newly emergent modalities of perception. the dreams we have dreamt into reality all around us are dead
