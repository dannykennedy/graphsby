Our purpose is to raise individual and cultural appreciation for the value of dreams and to disseminate information that will assist and empower us in taking responsibility for our cultural, emotional and spiritual well-being with the help of dreams \& mythology. Our goals are to unite and serve those who respect dreams, to empower dreamers in demystifying dreamwork and to assist with the integration of dreamsharing into our culture, in whatever ways of integrity are shown and given us.

We believe that dreams are agents for change and often reveal important new insights about the life of the dreamer, both personal and cultural. Recalling a dream is a signal that we are ready to understand the information that has been presented. Enacting the dream's hint can bring personal empowerment.

We seek to provide a balance and to give all nations, voices and schools of thought an opportunity to be heard.

There will be times when a particular area of interest will be given greater emphasis than another because of the limited space in the Journal and that which is surfacing that is of interest to the readership.

The emphasis will change over time to allow for a wide range of opinions and areas of interest to be explored and expressed.

You are invited to indicate areas of interest and questions you would like to see explored in future issues.

## About our Front Cover Artist

Paul Heussenstamm is well known for his capacity and clarity in helping others discover the "language of the soul." A fourth-generation artist, Paul's formal education and degree in fine arts could not have prepared him for the ultimate revelation of his life's work: The artistic sharing and teaching of an ancient language and powerful symbol, the Mandala. for many, Paul's intensely colorful paintings are for and from the soul and serve as a pathway to selfrealization, healing and wholeness. In the artists own words, "My work is an invitation to seek and explore artistically the fundamental patterns of nature and the soul."

For more than three years, Paul has taught Art as a Spiritual Path throughout the U.S. and Canada. If you are interested in having Paul come to your home, school or business and for further information on lectures on workshops, commissioned paintings or soul readings, please call 714/497-2709 or write PO Box 836, Laguna Beach, CA 92652.

Kim Apicella has been a professional artist for sixteen years and has been inspired to work with dreams in the form of narrative painting since 1994. "My drawings and paintings have evolved from pure abstractions toward what I term narrative symbolism. This came from a desire to communicate more clearly within myself and with viewers. Each object and color in a work is imbued with esoteric and exoteric meaning drawing inspiration from a variety of sources. Some of these sources include dreams and childhood, Pahari (Punjab) miniature paintings, folk painting traditions from India, the elements of matter and meditation, as well as Hindu hymn texts like The Rig-Veda and Bhagavad Gita." Paintings are gouache on illustration board and measure 11 "x11." If you would like more information about Kim's work, to purchase a painting, or to have your dreams painted in this style, send inquiries to Clear Vision Studio, 1440 Central Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63139.

The land is barren, no grass, trees, shrubs, Gurnans or animals.
For as far as 7 can see there is only scorchied brown earth all the way to the horizon.
Then the air and alf of the skiy is undufating, slowly swirling colors of orange, red and a bit of blue. There is no fine, per se, but intense heat and a sense that the colors are what is left after all has been destroyed. There is an overwhelming sound in the air like the Gum of electric wines from a huge transformer: Tiue just come to be in this scene, nothing precedes or follows. $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{m}}$ standing here watching what 7 inned iately frnous is the end of the world.

0ver the time l've stewarded this publication, l've had the pleasure of experiencing and witnessing our courage at swimming upstream, against the mainstream. I have seen, encouraged and validated (and vice-versa) many of you, who were trembling in their anatomies, step out and evolve significant careers for yourselves in a field that is just beginning to become visible and respected in our culture.

Among those individuals are Rosemary Watts and Gail Arrenholz-Roberts, both creative, gifted and committed dreamworkers, artists and Networker/advocates in their areas for dreams and Dream Network. They are primarily responsible for the wondrous display of spirit and inspiration you will enjoy on these pages. To you both, BRAVO!

Our cover is appropriately entitled "Surrender to the Feminine" and is presented in honor of the predominately feminine contributions contained herein. Rainbows of love to you, Paul Heussenstamm, creator of this extraordinary

work. Paul has contributed a significant portfolio of his Mandala paintings for our pleasure.

In the spirit of this issue, we have currently made a decision to highlight various dreamers and dreamworkers in various regions who are working so heartfully to encourage and educate in their areas. If YOU would like to consider 'host(ess)ing a near future issue, please be in contact.

This past holiday season, 1 was inspired to share two very significant 'nat ure teachings' with many of you. I sent it via email with no expectation of response, really. However, what I received is so nurturing, thought provoking and timely that I have chosen to share both with you. Wow! Now it's yours! Here it is:

Once, when I went on a weekend camping trip to one of my favorite spots in the Pacific Nort hwest, I was given a special gift. I would like to share it with you this Solstice evening.

I arrived shortly before sunset and set up my campsite near the confluence of the Hoh! River and Pacific Ocean. Once everything was in place, I snuggled into my sleeping bag, leaned back and closed my eyes, hoping soon to 'hear' the riverspeak and get into the rhythm of this Oh! so special and magical place, I immediat ely saw an image....
.... of a strong beam of Light shooting directly into my crown chakra and swiftly zooming out through my solar (soul-er) plexus. The voice within said: "You are a conductor."
On another outdoor adventure/ teaching, I went on a trip with about a dozen people here in the SouthWest, down the Colorado River. Way down. After two days and nights, we arrived at a spot where the Colorado and the Green Fivers merge (I had been to this point several times before and always heard the warning, "Don't go beyond this point") and the next day, were preparing to do just that: go further downriver. We were being 'led' by an experienced river guide. This was in the early spring, when runoff from the nearby LaSal Mountains is mighty. (That's where lasal.net in dreamkey@asal.net comes from, by the way)

We were on two large rafts with engines, the kind that have a platform tied onto two long rubber flotation devices called pontoons. Two others and myself, feeling no doubt frightened but not wanting to show it, decided to ride through Cat aract Canyon (where the river narrows to solid red sandstone walls/no bank and takes a significant drop) on the 'pontoons'. You could straddle them like you would a horse. Within a short time, we were in the thick of it, big time. Whew! I remember it well. The other two decided to get back onto the raft while I remained a-straddle.

Without much time to prepare for it, we were suddenly in white-water so turbulent that it was hard to see and zap! our raft headed right into the 'gut' of a wave so huge it felt that we were in an ocean storm! Simultaneously, our boatman (the experienced one) was thrown overboard, our motor drowned/ died, one man lost his glasses,

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-07.jpg?height=1161&width=1789&top_left_y=127&top_left_x=168)
another got a large gash on his forehead, a third went into shock and I was thrown (fortunat ely) back onto the raft. It was pandemonium par excellance. And for the next timeless time, it was a matter of simply holding onto the ropes on the raft .... for dear life.

I remember clearly looking over to the other raft (which was still somewhat in tact) and securing deep eye contact with a woman friend. Non-verbally, we said to one another: "This is serious!"

This is what all the signs and my gut/ intuition tells me about now and the coming year + . This is serious!

My downriver story has a happy ending. Let me share it.

Once we got past the rapids -it seemed like several lifet imes later, it occurred to me the experience was a metaphor for life it self: turbulence, then calm, then turbulence, then calm. Just enough calm to prepare for the next rumble; like labor/ childbirth! Like NOW.

Eventually, the other raft was able to tow ours to shore and we did emergency things first (attended the wounds, calmed the man in shock, etc.), and were working hard to avoid asking the question "What's happened to Jim?" Jim being, of course, the boatman who had gone overboard ever so long ago. When it seemed pressing and inevit able that we talk about it, he (Jim) came bounding downriver, smiling ear-to-ear, life jacket in tact. He thoroughly enjoyed the experience!

Once we all recouped, told our stories, fears and excitements, we journeyed a bit further downriver and spent the early evening and overnight in one of the most beautiful canyons l'll ever see in my life. MultiRainbow colored dripping springs, caves with stalactites and st alagmites and I slept near a lovely pond over which an ot herworldly tree arched its limbs, feeling absolutely certain that all the life threat ening chaos we had gone through get here was very well worth it.

I also believe these teachings are a precursor for the times ahead.

Let us Ride the Waves and Conduct the Light!

 Questions, Dreams \& LeflersFrom $\leftrightarrow$ YOU! $\boldsymbol{}$

## Conductor Frances Ring

## Confranting <br> the Collective Shadow

I'd like to offer my "dream" on your beautiful experiences. It goes like this:

I feel that 1998 was a "serious," very serious, year and 1999 on into $2000+$ will continue - with completing the "unfinished," collective-soul business and the purging, cleansing and healing on both individual and collective levels which began with perhaps, Viet Nam in the 60's. Dark archetypal energies around the issues of "power," "control," "freedom," "truth," "trust" and "integrity" have penetrated and contaminated all of our culture's institutions: familial, religious, educational, military, judicial, legislative, executive - "the political." Top to bottom, and rooted in the very soul of a longtime dysfunctional, fear-bound, "other-oriented/ directed" collective.

I believe each of us, individually, collectively (and globally) have been charged with the horrendous "life and death" task of serious "housecleaning." Not one of us can really escape responding to this call, of bringing the Light into all previously denied/rejected/ projected areas of the shadow-side of our human endeavors. This is definitely not a "movie" that most Americans want to stand in line to see, as evidenced by all the cross-fire of finger-pointing and scape-goating!

Furthermore, I think Clinton (and his entire administration) has been the unwitting "carrier" of not only the positive projections of TAP (The American People), but, alas, also of all the negative, archetypal projections of everyone from, say, Joe Six-pack, the Holier-than-Thou, Far-Right Christian Coalition (aka "the Republican Party"), Sally/John Victim/Freeride to the Wall Street Pundits and the Privileged Power-hungry - of all the dark "complexes" of the body-politic at large. Perhaps, on another level, it is a "task" he took on at the personality/politico level but, being larger than the individual, these collect ive energies have coalesced through him and subsequently led him (kicking and screaming, like the rest of us!), and all who surround him (both defenders and antagonists alike) into the labyrinth of the American Collective Shadow. We are all affected by this "drama" of Olympian/Herculean proportions. And we each affect, within the rippling sphere of our own individual dramas, the "outcome!" Clinton, however, as the "Atlas" in the collective \& global spotlight, cannot afford to "shrug."

It is not up to me to judge right or wrong his behaviors and choices; I do not know of his individual soul's task. But I do believe that the corrupt, unconscionable aspects of this country's institutions and processes, are being laid bare for the purpose of healing -and transformation.

If ever we as a collective need "Light Conductors" it is NOW. If we can't "see" the woundedness, we can't heal it. Clinton has had exposed his "woundedness" on the individual level which, I truly believe, is but an ugly reflection of our deep woundedness on the collective level.

Moreover, the very institutions which seek to try, judge and reject him - now within a lame-duck (!) Congress and next year, if the momentum is sustained on into the new Congress - are so doing within the perspective of their/ our own "darkness" i.e. woundedness.

Perhaps with our finally facing, braving, and letting-go unto the
Unknown of all the terrifying "rapids \& furbulence," we will all spill out into the healing, "calm pond" and peace (i.e. the "homecoming" of previously lost aspects of our Soul) which we all seek. I sense that Clinton, enemies and defenders, the collective at large, you and me - we are all charged with this task, requiring us to access the previously unrecognized Resources of Openhearted Courage, Strength, Honesty, Truth, Respons-ability, Community and Vision - and to translate these Resources into actions. But mostly the Resources of the kind of Love, Compassion, Knowingness and Em-Power-ment that transcends ego.

Are we up to, prepared for, this task? Or do we as a collective prefer to continue losing our minds in the soulless "bread \& circuses" of who plays in, wins the Super Bowl; petty gossip; various consensus-reality indulgences and sensation-seeking; blaming and judging "ot hers" while refusing to "look inside ourselves," etc.? And it's "business as usual" once the "Clinton thing" is dispatched: just different personalities in "high places;" same old toxins contaminating the collective, top to bottom?

This is "serious", I agree. A serious task, serious "housecleaning". Perhaps, we might look to Sirius - as a symbolic Light Within and take up both Heart and Sword to follow the example of such Light Conductors as yourself!

Yes! These times are "teachings" and a "precursor for the times (and tasks) ahead! I know it is not an easy "calling" or quest! But, characteristically, with such experiences, we often have no other choice - but if we just remember to "stay connected" and keep breathing, while gathering the inner resources to straddle the seemingly cyclical "turbulence and rapid's of this thing called "Life,"

Conductor Linda Gail on Y2K
When Life Hands You Lemons, Make Lemonade

I had a dream. I was eating a heart-shaped sugar cookie with a lemon filled square in the middle. I didn't give it much thought.

As the day unfolded, I spoke at length with a new friend about the computer millennium bug/ Y2K. As I went to bed, stirred by all the implications and exhausted, I realized the dream was about making lemonade out of lemons!

At one time it was the fear of nuclear war. I have heard retired military persons rant about a black and white war the underground was preparing for; I've heard of the alien blue babies that are due to be born and take over the world, the water people who will rise up out of the sea... and of course, the judgment days that will bring the wrath of God in the form of fire that will spare only a few chosen ones. Then there was HaleBopp and David Koresch. Gobal warming. After all the end-of-theworld threats, some of us are either overwhelmed or have developed a sense of apathy about it all.

There is much speculation about what the new millennia will bring. There has been so much focus and anticipation over the year 2000, that it should be a creative, evocative intense time to be alive. We all knew the industrial madness had to come to an end. It is no wonder we unwittingly sabotaged every feasible system in the world via a tiny microchip (like the mustard seed?) programed with so little foresight.

So what is the worst possible scenario? The biggest concern seems to be that we will have no power/electricity. So..... candles. Kerosene lamps. We will go to bed at dusk and awaken at dawn. Our schedules have forced unnatural sleeping patterns, anyway. Ever been late on a utility bill? How merciful are utility companies? Perhaps privately owned generat ors will become the criteria for keeping up the Joneses!

Refrigeration? It used to be a windowsill in the winter, or a bucket in well water, or a cellar. People only cooked what they could eat in one sitting or day. We used to have smoke houses and we canned our own foods. Food: the next greatest concern. So, we will see the back yard gardens crop up. Chemical free, clean vegetables and fruits will be the result. And meat? No more steroids of antibiotics consumed in artery clogging animal flesh. We will have to raise and kill it ourselves.... if we can.

I cherish the days of a wood burning stove and piles of blankets on the bed. My Granny never threw away anything; recycling meant something entirely different to her.

Many think jobs will be scarce. I hardly think so. There will be plenty to do, for sure. And if they are scarce? How busy are you trying to pay for all of the 'modern conveniences'? People used to sit out on their porches and have family meals. Remember those days?

What if there were no more assembly lines, no more cars moving: no more pollution, no more road kill.

A few weeks ago, I was at a grocery store when their computer went down. Employees had to add everything by hand. Taxes were different on many items: food, , laundry supplies, liquor and tobacco... and each caused the clerk to focus intently, making sure no one was over or under charged. They couldn't even open the register drawer to give change. All the while, the manager wondered how this was going to effect his inventory. They were all but helpless and a bit flustered at first, but in time, they did become resourceful, if not almost glad and greatly relieved to experience that they could handle life without computers.

The financial structure could collapse, eradicating trillions of dollars worth of debt that can never be repaid.... like the one made on a cross how many years ago? The credit card, mail order scams will cease to exist and guess what? Cash! Now, what a novel concept.

I believe it will be quite interesting to see what and who will be affected and what/ who won't. Those who give into fear and paranoia will be the ones who suffer the most. People could be jumping off bridges and shoot ing themselves and one another (much like they are now?).

I did have a dream voice that warned of troubled times ahead. I now know what the voice was talking about. I had so many other concerns already, that the computer bug/ Y2K has just now become another focus of attention for me. I will prepare, but lightly.

What is the worst thing that could happen? We might die. So, we get to go see God! What if the world does perish in fire and brimstone? There are other worlds. If we don't go up in rapture? There will be other raptures. Didn't make it to heaven? Reincarnation is a neverending means for redemption.

We have been through how many wars? Threats? Pestilence? Drought? Famines? Depressions? Comets? Floods? Yet the Earth has never stopped turning.

The world, as we know it now, will no doubt come to be dramatically changed, maybe even come to an end. The end always implies a new beginning.

It is the things of the spirit that are most important. Things of the world rust, decay and can be eaten by moths, but spirit is forever and we are promised eternal life.

Linda Gail, IL

## Conductor Art Funkhouser

 Use As a Lightening RodThe two wondrous experiences you so spontaneously share leave me almost breathless with wonder and delight. Thanks very, very much, both for telling me about them and for considering me a person who you would like to share something so deeply personal, meaningful and important with; I am honored and also humbled in the face of such powerful events.

I share the conviction that you are a conductor (like copper and silver) and are doing a brilliant job of it. Conductors can be used as lightening rods and I bet you sometimes feel that way. They are also irreplaceable these days for the transmission of information and bringing us together.

I realized that a conductor is also someone in charge of getting an orchestra to work together and produce beautiful music. The Dream Network is certainly an important step in that direction.

## Conductor Joy Gates

Bringing Light
into the Darkness
We enjoyed a delight ful and magical solstice celebration. We sanctified and inaugurated our new playroom-medit ation room at the time of the solstice. But to know what that really means, l'll have to start from the beginning.

When we first moved to this house, the basement (which has a separate out side entrance from the house) was a dark and sucky space - bare flooring rafters just inches above the head, pipes and wires one needed to duck under, dirt floor covered by plastic covered by gravel. The basement was only partially dug out maybe two thirds. The undug part was casually covered by plast ic sheet ing held down by bricks. And this is where our washer and dryer are placed, amid all those spiders and dark shadows.

Suddenly, about a month ago Bill and I were given the realization that we could transform that negative space into a playful and light-filled place. We partitioned off a room via hanging sheet s from the flooring, and made a ceiling from sheets too. Then we enlarged it to include more of the basement and we began to decorate it. Golden garlands, a small Christ mas tree, candles, posters of galaxies and nebulae pinned to the walls, sculptures of natural wood, mobiles, Christ mas tree lights strung across the basement, t wo chairs and a small table! What a transformation from a dungeon, a dark hole, to a magical place of light. And we celebrated the solstice there.

This great transformation nat urally called for more of the same throughout the basement, so I have begun tacking up plast ic overhead to cover more of those pipes and wires, with plenty of uncovered space where we have a workroom and storage area so that moisture won't accumulate. It is amazing what a good dose of mindfulness and creativity can do when one doesn't have money to TRULY structurally modify a place. We have a little indoor garden with plant ers under one of the two outside windows, and a bench and birdbath (it holds creative, fun objects, not water). Our inner child can come out here and play! Let the good times roll!

## Conductor Tom Goad:

## Several Meanings

Conductor has several meanings. We are but a "conductor" of higher energy. This is not really what people mean, I think, when they speak of channeling. It's just that when we have no inner blocks, we "conduct" power from a larger/ higher/ great er source.
I keep thinking of symphony conductors too. I remember being told that the profession with people who have the lowest stress levels in the world, and which live the longest, are symphony conductors. The speaker then quoted another statistic saying that the profession with the highest stress and the shortest life-span were interestingly enough - the performers in the symphony. He was making a point about being proactive vs, reactive, and about taking charge of our lives and "conducting" our lives in an artful, skillful, proactive way.

## Conductor Tony Golembieski "Wakeful Dreams"

A friend of mine, in her lessons, pushes the idea of wakeful dreams. This is not a matter of wakeful awareness but of symbolic exchange that crosses over the boundary of wakefulness and sleep. Peal time events, as she sees it, can be considered dreams, at least under certain circumstances. These circumstances are dictated by need. If you need a message, it will come and the messenger does not respect our simple divisional system of dreams and wakefulness. Your canyon experience could be considered a dream - a message.

The beautiful tales of metaphorical experience touched and warmed me.

Yes, pushing beyond the turbulence brings its rewards - and is eventually worth the effort. I agree with you: I believe the storms ahead are turbulent and scary and of a magnitude and nature that has not been visited here before. But, as you wisely state, we are conductors of light
10 Dream Network/Vol. 17 No. 4 \& 18 No. 1
and that is our job - just keeping on keeping on conducting that which comes through us, I value the reminder.

Yes, these ARE serious times, but ones in which we will emerge transformed and richer somehow.

## Enjoy the Trip!

Thank you for sharing that memorable Colorado River adventure. Geez! That was a close one! You must have been scared out of your knickers. And I love how you found meaning in all of this and apply it now.
"This is serious!" Yes, in many ways we are globally and often personally in deep sh $\qquad$ But yet ... Look at Jim. The unspoken expectation was that he was a goner, or at the very least he had a BAD trip. But no, he returned unscathed having thoroughly enjoyed the trip. So, for me, that's a great lesson is giving up expectations.

And then to experience the awesome beauty of the canyons as if it were a reward for going through the fearful chaos time.

Yes, let us Conduct the Light. I like that.

## Conductor Gudrun Weber

## Powerful Metaphors

I am deeply touched by your stories, warmth and love. I, too, believe that the coming year will be difficult and demand of all who are in touch with the inner worlds of Light and Love... to hold these two divine qualities in our minds and hearts unwaveringly and transmit them as best we may into the world.

Perhaps this past year already foreshadowed what may lie ahead. As Jung reminded us, our task is not to strive for the light but to bring that light into the dark places. The river experience you shared serves as a powerful metaphor for our journey.

May I share a quote from AGNI YOGA (\# 406):
"Ponder what is danger. So-called danger is nothing other than fear about our present condition. But if we know that every condition is created by the consciousness, which is invulnerable, then there can be no physical fear. The danger of which it is so customary to warn, will dissolve in consciousness.
Therefore, the growth of consciousness is the most essential basis for onward progress. Instead of dangers, there will remain only obstacles; but these will serve only as a means to develop energy. If the mountain is perfectly smooth, we cannot ascend to the summit. Blessed are the stones that tear our sandals when we ascend! Thus assure yourself of the absence of dangers.
Each change of conditions will be an explosion of consciousness. But out of the explosions is molded the pulsation of the Cosmos. ..."

Conductor Cal Stroud Letting Go
Thank you for the very beau- tiful gift. What a great experience! As I read it, I am reminded of a little story that is the prologue of one of Richard Bach's books (interesting that I can remember the prologue, but can't remember what the book is).

He tells the story of a creature living in a river and like all the ot her little creat ures, he lives by clinging to the rocks in the river. But he longs to explore what is down stream. When he expresses his interest to the other little creatures, they all tell him that if he lets go he will be killed; he will be pulled down and crushed against the rocks.

The little creature finally gets up the courage to let go and sure enough, he is pulled down and thrown against the rocks time and time again. But finally, he feels the current begin to lift him up into a calm part of the river. As the other little creatures see what happens, instead of believing that they also can survive if they let go, they cast a mantle of godhood on their cohort and begin to worship him, thus avoiding the test of letting go and moving on to their own next level.

As life offers its ups and downs, it seems the only way to learn from it is to let go and stay awake.

# Tapping the Depths: The Rich World of Dream Hosting 

By Rosemary Wat ts
Years ago, I was fort unate to spend some time at Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California. During my training, I was captivat ed with Stephen Aizenst at's approach of "Dream Craft ing," through a dream process called "Hosting the Dream." My experience with this method is that as I share it in my immediate world, it spreads ripples of deep meaning from each dreamer and co-participant, radiating into the world a delight ful way of being with dreams.

To quote Stephen Aizenst at: "Dream crafting is simply using your abilit y to hear deeply the st ories of the dreamtime; to see and wonder about the figures of the dreamscape; and to let whatever is inside the dream come out and live. To 'craft' a dream imaginally is to experience the figures of your dreams as guest s. If you ext end your hospit ality to them - become their host - they will reveal their mysteries and their messages with you." The important aspect of "Hosting" is not to interpret the dream, but rather to be with the dream. This allows the dream experience to have it s own energy, which will impact not only the individual and the collective, but also the world as a whole, the holonomic level.

I teach at a variety of places and often have the opportunity to share this "Hosting" method as part of my classes. There have been so many wonderful experiences that have come out of this process. I would like to share one example that captures the magical essence of "being with" the dream.

To begin the "Hosting" process, a dreamer volunteers. This doesn't have to be a "big" or numinous dream. Any dream can be used. The dream is shared in present tense, filling in details and nuances. Each participant asks clarifying questions so that all may feel clear about the flow of the dream, imagining it as if they were also in the dreamscape. The dreamer begins to share how it might relate to them as an individual, including any personal definitions and stories. Any literal connections to the dreamer's waking life circumstances are also shared, as are any puns observed. The dream is then explored as a group. Any myths, folk or fairy tales, legends, songs and other types of collective associations are examined.

At this point, the group is ready to "host" a specific image, symbol or nuance of the dream. This might include a specific dream figure (a priest or teacher), animal or insect (a bear or bee), an inanimat e object (a rocking chair or china tea cup), part of nature (a flower or stars), the environment (a storm or waterfall), the setting (a cave or front porch). As a group it is decided what to focus on for the hosting. This is an element which the group is curious about and would like to explore in more depth, which already has an air of electricity and intrigue.

The group is led in a simple form of meditation, to quiet breathing and thoughts, releasing any out side noises or distractions, allowing attention to be drawn within. Calling on Divine Guidance to assist in this process, the participants are encouraged to open heart s, minds, emotions and playful child selves for the process. The dreamer then st ates, out loud, the group's invitation. It can be more prayer-like or a simple request, whatever the dreamer feels compelled to say. An example might be: "As a group, we open ourselves to experience you fully, with listening hearts. We invite you, Waterfall, to come into our sacred circle and share your wisdom and
experience with us. Please share with each of us individually, as a collective group, including any guidance and/ or insights for humanity and on a world level, teaching us about our planet and all that inhabits this place." There is a palpable, energetic difference when this invitation is issued.

Then the listening begins ... deep listening, patient listening, full sensory listening. Each participant sits quietly, allowing the hosted dream energy to speak to them on these various levels: personal, collective and from a world awareness, including the messages and impact for the environment, the animals and the planet as a whole. Some go deeply within and have their own inner experience. Some go back and forth bet ween inner listening and recording these messages and impressions ont o paper. Some receive somet hing that must be recorded immediately as a poem, a picture, or a request for some physicalization of the experience. Each experience is unique.

Once this feels complete, the focus is brought back to sharing as a group. Each shares their experience and how they feel it relates to their personal life, what it might share for the group, the community, or humanity on a larger basis and finally how it connects to the world, animals, and the environment. The experience is usually so profound that it deeply moves the individual. The participants are often surprised by the results.

After the group has shared their inner experiences, it is decided how best to further host and honor the dream energy. This might include any combination of the following: acting out the dream or the hosting messages, creating a group dance or movement, claywork, a group poem, making something from art supplies or nat ure to honor the experience in a three dimensional form, creating a group song or tonal chant, taking pict ures or going through old pict ure albums and then sharing the film results, creating a group collage, etc. The creative urges that come out of the hosting process are full and varied. The completion of the hosting sharing usually is done at a later time (the next class or meeting), allowing for continued processing and inspiration. Oft en the participants are delight ed when the hosted energy continues to influence them by showing up in their dreams, arriving as gifts in a synchronist ic way, or guiding them to find "just the right thing" to bring back to the group. The hosted energy of the dream continues to live in and through each part icipant.

I would like to share a fuller experience of how this happened with a group of women at a retreat center not far from St. Louis. Rockhaven Center for Holistic Living is a residential retreat program that draws women from around the world (lit erally all parts of the globe!). This is a portion of the dream we
shared and host ed during one of the ret reat sessions.
"The Mission - Ifind myself in a haspice. Allof the people have $A 7 D \mathcal{S}$. Everyone lives in small communities. Inolice fiow supportive they are of one another, doing everything with qreat love and compassion. They seem very concerned about one man in their small community. He is special and seems to be the most fraqile. To ithout being told, 7 know that a man who has the vaccine needs someone lo get it out of the haspice so that it can be processed. Then others can lake it, because in its pure stale, it can kill. Suddenly, the fragile, sick man comes veer to me. Jfe hands me a small package. St is a dark qreen, pafmate leaf aith a dark black, bruised pocket on the loner right side of the leaf. In this pocket are fine white qrains securely tucked in. Jte seems frightened as he flands it to me. He ask's me to get his to the main offrice of the hospital. I immedialely grasp the impact of my mission, and my heart begins to pound wilt fear and my body shakes. I sense thal 7 am being aratched. Tfold the leaf and place it in my small, jeans pockel so that it aill be safe. I breathlessly reach the waiting room of the hospital. 7 encounter a big group of wamen and children. T ask them to surround me. $I$ feel so safe here. I do not reved that 7 have the leaf with the raw substance in my pocket."

"Just before l awoke, I recall thinking, 'Why me? Why did I have to be the one to carry the vaccine out?' I remained in this twilight stage feeling my heart pound and my body shake."

The group unanimously agreed to host the palmate leaf containing the healing grains. The experience was profound and there were a myriad of beautiful creations that came from this. One woman created a natural dream catcher out of a tender branch that she found while walking in the woods. It came complete with a green leaf that was still att ached to the branch, which she incorporated in her dream cat cher. One woman, from Japan, shared how the palmat e leaf is very important and sacred in several Japanese rituals. She shared the blessings from her home land, writing down these special messages in her own language on the shape of a leaf, at t aching a real, beautiful leaf to her piece, and completing it by placing a lightbulb on it to signify what an enlight ening experience this had been for her. (We all enjoyed the joyful humor in this.) Several people creat ed leaf-designed art. Beautiful poetry came out, as well. One poem that had been written out in green on a leaf-designed and real leafenhanced art piece said:
"Leaf
Green, shiny
Living, growing, decorating
Blade, petiole, stalk, stipules
Addicting, convicting, legalizing
Helpful, medicinal
Marijuana"
Another leaf-art piece included a glorious fall colored leaf with a tear on it at the exact same place as was described in the dream: "Leaf of Nature, Each season renewed, Ancient Wisdom, Fill us with Life." An additional leaf-art piece came out of a cut-down tree trunk with this poem:

## "Leaf of love and healing

Tender green of promise
Nations seek your presence
Shoot from stump of Jesse.
Sheltered in a woman
She of faith and questions
Teach us how to ponder
As we seek life's meaning."
There were other poems, art pieces and deep residual experiences shared,

Later the dreamer wrote to me to share some follow-up thoughts on this process and what had happened since our original host ing. "It took a lot of courage to speak up and share my dream before the entire group. It s power and impact was still with me. Even as I spoke my heart pounded. When we did the ritual (honoring the hosting process), I felt amazed at the way those who participated broadened the field of my dream, from personal, to communal, then global and universal. I realized my healing process also had those dimensions. I felt grat itude for the care taken to write poems, or do work in clay, or create art pieces and the sharing of what it meant to each person. When we finished putting all this new dream evidence together, a beautiful collage emerged. I was aware that it was no longer just my dream, but it was a wonderful healing gift for everyone there and a gift for all those people our lives would be touching."

This is but one example of the myriad of deeply moving, t ransforming, and creative experiences that are possible when utilizing the "hosting" method. I am convinced that as others experience and share this type of dreamwork with their friends, families, dream groups, clients and classes, the energy generat ed will have a posit ive ripple effect from the personal level, through the collective awareness and ultimat ely for greater healing and harmony on our planet.

## The Arts as Spiritual Discipline

by Gail Arrenholz-Robert s

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-18.jpg?height=684&width=1131&top_left_y=257&top_left_x=475)
The focus of my work is to paint dream symbols in wat ercolor and silk, to teach these media, to lead dream groups that help others find their creative "voice" and inadvert ently heal part icipants. My perspective on life is more anthropological than anything else and I view the arts as a spiritual discipline.

Chicago dream groups use theat er, dance, music, poetry, and art to creatively respond to the dreams we receive. Many participants have no previous creative training. Others refer to themselves as, " art damaged." Students artistic efforts have been invalidat ed and devalued by our rational and materialistic society.

The unconscious has offered up scores of music, pages of poetry, wondrous theatrical vignettes, and numerous paint ings with dream symbols as subjects. Some of our dream group's creations are receiving public not oriety. Recently we have experienced some new phenomena; one dreamer asks a question of the unconscious and the other receives the answer, or one dreams a sy mbol and later anot her participant borrows the symbol in his or her dream. We respond with a creative effort and the unconscious reciprocates with a creative response to our endeavor, i.e. a song. We are beginning to underst and ourselves as one tiny but significant thread in the tapestry of the dream world.

## Discovering Your Creative Gifts

While traveling in third world countries, you might have the pleasure of seeing "Indians" singing while harvest ing their crops, Phillipinos burying their dead in hand crafted, pink, paper mache Cadillac caskets, Navajo sand paintings that heal and Tibet an monks making music to purify the earth. Dreams have long been a source of spiritual wisdom and
creative inspiration. "Primitive" cult ures have never lost touch with this mystical, repressed feminine realm of being that Anglos refer to as the unconscious.

The French essayist Charles Augustin SainteBeuve wrote a century ago: "With everyone born human, a poet-an artist-is born, who dies young and who is survived by an adult." The watercolor painting you see entitled, "Huerfano" is a Spanish word meaning orphan. We could say that there was no room in the inn for him any more than for Christ's birth. This little boy is my abandoned creative spirit. He was conceived in the ink drawing called, "Corn God." His place of birth, too, was like that of Christ's, amidst the animals which are a symbol for our instincts. The Creator's intention for my life was made manifest on the day I had this dream; consciousness was brought into matter and my career as an art ist was launched. When we discover our creative gifts and share the joy they bring, we glorify the Creator.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-18.jpg?height=663&width=492&top_left_y=1837&top_left_x=1207)

Many of our students in either the Chicago dream group or the dreams and art classes confess that they are "art damaged," meaning that most probably they are intuitive types whose creative desires were invalidated by family and teachers of a more rational typology. Often the students were creative and decided to seek higher education, only to graduate with knowledge of technique and absence of desire to ever create again.

Harmful rumors abound in regard to the "true spirit of an artist." There is a mystique that surrounds the creative process and those who engage in it; for example, most people will tell you that some are simply born with this talent. In music of course there are the chosen few that have perfect pitch. This is elitist thinking perpetuated by members of "the club" who would have you think they are special. You will find their art in mausoleums called art galleries and their music in conservatories.

The explanation for this "state of the arts" in this country is subject for another article. Our purpose here is to help you rekindle your own relationship to the creative spirit within you through dream work and your regional dream group.

When we give credence to the unconscious, it begins to respond with affection and we enter into a kind of dream duet or a symphony of dreams when it addresses the group rather than the individual. Play with your dream symbols, don't analyze them. One day they will carry you into life and the future. Then you will intellectually know what they mean. Respond to them with your intuition, your body, and your feelings first. Don't kill them with your desire to name, categorize, and ultimately control them. We do this of course because we think that we won't suffer if we control things. Life involves suffering; get used to it, just do it hopefully and as consciously as possible!

"Corn God" by Gail Roberts
Now might be a good time to refer to a Haiku like dream that our film making dream group member received one night. The poem admonishes us to play in the corn, a delightful symbol for the creative. When we act as vessels for the creative force and simply wait for symbols to come from the spirit world, then they are holy or numinous and charged. We better avoid the power mongering of the ego by doing so. Technique oriented endeavors seem to smack of goal orientation rather than process and of ulterior motives rather than innocence.

Dreamers
We play in the corn-
Stalks and cars provide protection
and don't.
A feast promotes our celebration.
One of our party goes off
to fight injustice to us all.
We will battle
Whomever can beat the madman
is free...
The rains begin.
We play in the corn-

David Phyfer
Our newly acquired musician member sent me the following untitled musical composition. She has performed the song before two audiences and it seems to hint at the composer shadow called Sharon and her coming to consciousness. I suspect that this song is the first of many to come. She writes:

A week after joining the Geneva, Illinois, dream group, I woke from a nap with the start of a song in my mind. The words, "come moments agree," didn't seem to make much sense, but the melody was so attractive that I decided to finish the song at once. I had written songs before-for a folk group to sing in the coffeehouse-but not one like this. In a streamof-consciousness style, I wrote down words to complete the verse, and made up a " $B$ " part with its lyrics. It was rather lush and irregular, with strange chords that I could not immediately identify.

Come moments, agree
All the moments that are meant to be
Find Pleasure and Pain
Find their moment and return again.
All the moments
All the laughter
All the treasures
And the pain.
Come moments to me
All the movement of your mystery
Find Shadow and Shame
Find the moment and return again.

[^1]Come laughing to me
Come dancing
Come smiling
Come crying, come again.
I was reasonably certain that the lyrics had come from a place within me, but I was much less sure about the melody. I have a file in my brain that records all the melodies I have ever heard, and although, unfortunately, I cannot call them up at will, it does tell me whether or not I have heard a tune before. This melody seemed so comfortably familiar that lassumed at first that it was well known. However, I have run it past six professional or avid amat eur musicians, and no-one has even said, "It's close to . ."

The circumst ances of the nap that produced it are curious, too. In the early morning, I recorded a dream in which I look out the window of my childhood home and see my current friend, Sharon, coming up the walk. She waves to me, says "I'll see you soon," and get s in her car. Since Sharon is a psychic healer, I wondered if something of a spiritual nature was due. After journalizing this, I ate breakfast, then folt vaguely unsettled and decided to lie down on the couch to sleep, something I never do in the morning. Later in the day it occurred to me that Sharon is also a fantastic songwriter.

After a struggle to find the right chords for this song, and having to learn a new one on the guit ar, lam going to sing it for the dream group this week. Perhaps someone there will recognize the origins of my foundling melody. If not, I will be forced to accept it as a gift of the unconscious.

Another time we may sit on the floor with boxes of art istic media and paint our dreams on a brown paper scroll rolled out in front of the group. Sometimes we listen to music while we work. When finished, we each tell the story of our dream paint ing. When the symbols merge on paper, it becomes a primitive sort of mural. We are saving the scrolls to use in a dream workbook that was spawned in the dreams and art class. See the image marked, "Spirit Being." This painting evolved as one art ist began his inner journey and study of dreams.

Recently, an artist participant who happens to be a member of the Maharani tribe of Native Americans, had the following dream:
9 am slanding in a river basin amidsl a mountain range fitie the Tindes. 7 am facing a shaman who has a pair of nuands and continuously maves the wands in a rliythmic motron.

The group did a psychodrama or theatrical amplification of the dream. We had the dreamer role reverse with the shaman and a group member took the dreamer's role. After gleaning information from the dreamer while he played the role of the shaman, we had the dreamer become himself and the other member became the shaman. The shaman then imparted the wisdom gained from the shaman. The group spont aneously surrounded the dreamer and one member suggested we move rhythmically like the shaman moved his wands. As we encircled the dreamer and swayed with wand like movement, someone burst into song with, "Row, row, row, your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merr-ily, life is but a dream!" Later, the dreamer decided to sculpt a set of wands in honor of his dream.

Since that night, several of us have
borrowed the shaman as a symbol.
Lately we sit in a circle and each person shares a little about their week and the most significant dream to they have had. In the past two or three meetings, we have noticed that the dreams seem to tell a story and there is a feeling of being woven into a great dream tapestry.

Then there was the time that one male dreamer had a feast or celebration dream in which one anima figure cloaked his shoulders with a white garment that gave him a sense of protection. Another anima figure served him a dumpling type food that had been sprinkled with a spice like cinnamon. His association to this was an experience in Taos, of being invited to the 'House of the Grandmothers' for a feast amidst Native Americans. During the following weeks' group, the women in the group responded by preparing the dumplings and corn bread. We cloaked the dreamer with a white silk shawl and initiated the ceremony with drumming and smudging. We talked of how different all our lives would have been had we been initiated at puberty into our opposite like the dream demonstrates. What if the old women had told our dream group men that they were creative men, men who would have to spend more time and effort relating to their own anima, feelings, and intuition. One man inadvertently expressed his frustration and feelings of isolation from other men whose sole topic of conversation revolves around foot ball!

I chose to honor a dream that, simply stated, placed me in bed with a 300 pound musicologist friend that was just waking up. My way of honoring the dream was to seek out a Highland bagpiping teacher. I have been a student now for two years and am preparing to audition for a band called, "Tunes of Gory." Sometimes I serenade the group at the end of the evening with a tune followed by an Irish blessing.

In Matthew Fox's book, "The Coming of The Cosmic Christ" he has a chapter that discusses the resurrection of our creative spirit along with the feminine face of God. This will take place only after we have sufficiently brought Christ into consciousness. He was, after all, a creative man; a carpenter!

I am reminded now of a quote from my beloved analyst, "What else are we but the number of ways we can express ourselves?" \}

# Fishing with Soseph Campbell 

Jim Freeman St. Louis, Missouri

Goseph Campbelf chiooses me to go fishing avilf fium.
This is great - he's fanous for his simple fishing style and now 7 gel to experience it firsthand.
He carries everything in a little brown jug made of porcelain with a burnt umber earth tone. It contains fishing bait and two sets offishing fines, each of which is attackied to a cubicle block of wood that reminds me of a children's building block. The jug even contains tao licenses.

So as fong as Jamn witf firn fishing, Idon't need to buy my own license.
Ttis method is mysterious, but it works: he simply throws the jug in the flowing water and the fishing line naturally unwinds. The fish naturally take the bzit. The blocks ane easily graspable. As we walk

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-22.jpg?height=1440&width=1654&top_left_y=971&top_left_x=233)
south toward the border, Goseph throns the jug effortlessly, lanquidty, like fis way of speaking, into the stream which is flowing right to left.

As we head further down the stream, the fishing fine washes ashore in front of us.
Already au've caught a fish - a beautiful blue-black fish, exotic looking with clear gray eyes and a thin red stripe along its lengih. T'm excited and curious, but concerned that 7 don'l know how to untangle the line and unhook the ish (if there even is a hook). Joseph simply takes the setup and throws it back into the river: The main point is the journey, not the actual catching of the fish. The fish aill get itself off of the line naturally, or perhaps it will be the bail for an even larger fish. As we aulf downstream, Goseph notices how the river has changed. Tt used to be much easier to access. As Ilook doansineatn, Inotice that the water is moving very quicfly fike at spring runoff, approaching perfiaps flood stage. The water rises up in biq waves, mud-brown with silt, afinost touching the overhanging bushes and tree branches. I am aware we can't walk afong this left bank anymore, the brush is too dense and the water too swift for wading downstream.
Is Yoseph's intention lo cross here, where the water is caliner, in order to get to the other side? 7 am in the middle of the river; in process of crossing it. Ilook upstrean and see a huge fish rise up out of the water as it comes towards us; its head poking vertically out of the water: St's a dolphin! Goof! T'm very excited. Wait. Th's not a dolphin nor a porpoise. It's a shark with a gaping mouth full of leeth. Tfeelfrightiened, spooky. Thien Isee they (for there are many of them in a line) are dead or made of rubber. They are black and white and floal vertically very high in the water, more than two-thirds of their Godies above the flow. Something must have given way upstream (perhaps
the holding pool of an amusement park). And now everytfing is flowing downstream. As usual Goseph is unconcerned, undistracted, stifl intent on flowing with the river on our simple journey. The are on the other side of the river at the point of an island. Ilook dowinstreain and see that the water is a beautiful blue-green. The current is sauift but not turnultuous. The arater's cofor shoous its deepness. I wonder if we should fish here to pull up some of the large fish deep below, but Loseph wants lo move on to the ruins for a picnic. Ats we stand there, the avater gently rises and flows atop the concrete platform from which we are walching. As the avater gently nears my feel, Gjust as gently move to my right to let it flow past ine and then back down. Ti's fun to inove rhythinically with its ebb and flow as Italk

The are at the ruins. There are many kinds, Gotf Occidental (medieval) and Oriental (Jindu). To)e are above them, sitting on Josepti's bench at the edge of an easily accessed roadway. The ruins are situated at the edge of a fong meadon, afong which the roadnay runs. Across the ineadou is a thick forest (where adventures begin). The ruins I see firsi are the Hindu, off a short distance to our right. Irecognize the oriental architecture and find the greens of the thick moss and vines beautifut. The sun is warm and bright and the cofors of all 7 see rich and intense. The Occidental ruins are straight ahiead, covered with the same beautiful deep green thick moss. Yosephi isn't currous about excavating the ruins; fie comes here to picnic because hie likes the richness of this spot. So we sit and eat the sandaiches he has brought.

It is peaceful, easy, yet exciting.

Iwas into the third week of a seven week dream work shop when one of my students asked me if I thought I could help her son with night terrors.
l attended church with Cindy and Austin. He was nine years old. The Sunday I was to meet with Aust in rolled around with anticipation by us all. It started out with Cindy telling me about a dream she had "a female doctor urged her to wake up and check on Austin. She voiced concerns about his medication."

Austin had asthma. I hadn't known before. Everything inside me told me the asthma had something to do with his nightmares. An oracle experience was taking place. Reality will always rise up and speak to us if we will just listen and/or recognize. I relaxed a bit when Cindy told me about her dream. I knew I was being prepared.

Aust in told me the tales of an "evil" clown who pursued him in his night mares. The clown

## The Healing of <br> Austin <br> By Linda Gail

showed up on countless occasions. The dream was always the same. "The clown chased him and taunted, playing on his fears with intent to harm or even kill him." Aust in couldn't sleep through the night, getting up two and three times only to show up in his parent's bedroom. The symbolic images in the night mares had been inspired by movies he had watched.

I asked Aust in to draw me the clown. He just kept talking, toying with the markers and paper in his hands. On impulse I decided to draw a "demon" I had once met with in an out of body experience.

Stunned, Austin said, "You just drew my clown!"

He at last began to draw. His hands trembled. He shook everywhere. He coughed. He was terrified.

His reaction confirmed it. I was right. The clown was his asthma pursuing him in his dreams. He had fears of dying, of death and his own immortality. He had at first told me the clown couldn't die because in the movie he couldn't. I said, "Aust in it is your dream. You can change the rules."
1 instructed him on how to face the clown, telling him it was his dream, his reality and to tell it to just "go away." It was a belief in demons that brought about the image in the first place.

When we dream we must learn to face and cast out negative ideas because they have no place in heaven!

As I talked to his mother afterwards Austin listened in. He asked, "You mean God is trying to heal me of my asthma with these night mares?"
"Night mares are shock therapy." I replied. "By facing the clown, you face the asthma and your fears about dying".
"Oh, I get it." Austin's mind reeled and clicked in all the puzzle pieces of his night mares and underst ood greater than any of us can imagine. We could see it in his face. He was looking in his own back door. Cindy said he maintained that expression on his face for hours.

He asked me to take the picture home and throw it away. It was a strange temptation to keep it. As I tore it up, I ment ally asked him to keep his promise to me as I had his.

Two nights later that clown showed up with the usual attempt to frighten Austin. But Aust in had new dreaming tools. He said the magic words that have worked so often for me. "This my dream, my reality. You don't belong here. Go away!" That clown left his dreams for good and took the asthma with him.

He was so excit ed and pleased with himself when he told me !

Aust in slowly weaned himself off the medication on which he had been so dependent. He stopped visiting his parent's room at night. I never took credit for his healing. I only planted seeds and attempted to set him in the right direction. The rest was up to him. I was amazed at how well he did.

One week after he faced that clown he dreamed.... "His father was throwing baseballs way over the trees for him to catch. He then walked through a forest and went to fish in a huge body of water. He kept pulling up a whopper of a fish that tugged and pulled and once even managed to pull him into the vast amount of water. But he was okay. Austin then got a better rod to fish with and saw his family including his grandparents, sitting next to a fireplace. He began to tell them about the fish."

Every time lact as a catalyst in the healing of an individual, regardless of the circumstances, I only bring out the flood waters of the issues surrounding the affliction.... be it alcoholism, cancer or lung disease. I have always understood it was the faith and decision of the afflicted, what the outcome was to be.

The magic, wonder and thrill of God's works always serves to amaze, astound and of course, humble me in His presence.

The minister of the church had no healing stories of his own to report within his ministry. The very foundation of the church we were attending centered around Bingo that provided the means for a rather elegant new chapel for the church. The minister and his wife were both chain smokers. Once we told him about Austin a month after the healing, sermons began with accusations of me and Cindy of worshiping golden cows and rituals instead of relying on faith.

Austin found himself wavering and later relying on medication from time to time. Cindy never realized the significance of this minister being her appointed spiritual leader and being subject to his beliefs.

Austin at least momentarily stepped into bigger than life shoes just long enough to give him a clearer picture of reality he won't ever forget.

## The <bina <abluet

I remember Grandma A, my maternal grandmother. That's what we called her. She was a short lady, about $5^{\prime} 2^{\prime \prime}$, a bit plump with a round face, tightly permed hair covered by a thin hair net, polished fingernails and flabby upper arms that felt so good when she hugged you close.

I'm told that as youngsters, Mom, my two sisters and I would be at her home frequently during the day. I only remember Saturday night visits as a family and most vividly the year and a half that I lived with her when I was 9 years old while Mom was in the hospit al

On Saturday night visits, the kids were often into the kitchen for snacks and somet imes we were allowed to play games at the dining room table. Across from the table was "The China Cabinet." It was offlimits to the kids. The "very special" dishes and "breakables" were kept there. All we could ever do was look - never open it!

Only adults could do that.
One day a few short months before my upcoming wedding, I was visit ing Grandma A. She was ill and not sure she'd make it to my wedding. As we talked about my plans for the day and the honeymoon, Grandma got up from her chair, limped slowly to the dining room and beckoned me to follow her. She stopped at the china cabinet. My heart raced with wonder and excitement as she unlocked the door. I wondered what she was doing. Then from the cabinet she took a lovely cream colored vase. She held it briefly in her hands, turning it around, admiring it, being careful not to drop it. It was the most beautiful vase I had ever seen! The flowers were a soft mut ed color, perhaps a rose.
26 Dream Network/Vol. 17 No. 4 \& 18 No. 1

Neither of us spoke. She turned slowly and presented the vase to me. I hesit at ed. "Go ahead, hold it," she said smiling proudly, "It is one of my dearest possessions; it comes from my Ireland, you know." I stood there holding the delicate vase looking in awe of it.
Grandma said, "This vase has been in my family for generations. It is time for me to pass it on. I'm sure your Mom is smiling from heaven in approval. I hope you treasure it always. I know of your love and respect for nature. Be sure it cont ains fresh flowers
often." I stood there speechless and in shock I could not believe what was happening. Tears welled in my eyes as I tried to utter words of thank you.

Once more she turned to the china cabinet and removed a lovely handmade cloth. It was a cream colored Irish linen with the same flower design as the vase. She held it close to her face to touch and smell and then smiling turned to me and offered it to me as tears welled in her eyes. "This too," she said. "You must have this. It goes with the vase. May you use these often to celebrate all the "special occasions in your life"!

In an inst ant memories of our days together flooded across my mind. She patiently taught me to sew. As a youth of 11 years, 1 st ubbornly tried to skip steps and rush the process. She was determined to have me do it right "so it will last," she'd say. We would st ay for dinner on sewing days, laugh and try to delay parting.

I held her close, hugging her as tears rolled down my cheeks. I promised to cherish these gifts always - gift s that symbolized for me, her special love for me, her acceptance of me as an adult woman, as an individual. These gifts remind me of her sharing her time, her "self" with me, creating with me.

Grandma A. didn't make it to the church for my "special day." We visited her in her bedroom. She died a few months later. Her spirit, her gifts are with me today! $\}$

The Living Labyrinth:
Exploring Universal Themes in Myths, Dreams, and the Symbolism of Waking Life

By Jeremy Taylor
Paulist Press
997 Macart hur Boulevard, Mahwah, NJ. 07430. 1998
AIl humans tend to live by some sort of story, even when we are not aware of it. Many of us who pick up this journal have learned to see our own story reflect ed in our nightly dreams. We may even be aware of some general connection between those personal dreams and myths from around the world. In this book, Jeremy dives right into the common ground between dreams and myths, by examining the archetypal stories, symbols and energies they share. During the journey, we see precisely how these energies are present right now, in our inner worlds, our lives and the world around us. This is no abst ract discussion, this stuff is alive and surprisingly present!

The author is a warm and engaging st oryt eller, writing with a strong personal voice. Many readers will not even notice that this is an ambitious and challenging work. Ranging from the collective repression of the Great Mother to the deeper signi- ficance of vampires and UFOs, this journey covers a lot of territory. Yet by showing how stories revealed in myth and dreams continue to shape our daily lives, it all holds together very well.

There is no fear of controversy here. The introduction launches into the dream research of Crick and Mitchison which suggested that dreams were essentially meaningless "downloading the junk from our computers." The biting criticism reveals both the fighting spirit with which we can approach the subject, as well as the urgent need to combat the ongoing efforts to dismiss dreams and mythwhich regularly assert themselves in our modern world.

He also boldly challenges Jung's view of the Trickster archetype as "archaic," with a diminishing relevance to our contemporary world. "All the archetypes are "archaic," "timeless," and regularly "take shape and assert themselves" as repeating

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-28.jpg?height=505&width=481&top_left_y=322&top_left_x=1386)
patterns in our contemporary lives and circumstances. The Trickster in particular, far from being a "vanishing" archetypal energy, dominates the course of contemporary life." Further, the point that such an academic approach to an important archetype amounts to a kind of unconscious repression, which results in the energy reappearing in new and darker forms... could explain a lot in our current situation. Certainly this is a useful perspective to keep in mind when we watch the daily news.

This book explores rich new territory, and should leave most readers with a fresh perspective on their lives, and the stories that move just below the surface. The stories continue.... and the conversation has just begun

## Incubating for a New Career

by Patricia Ponke

1have been searching for a new career. As various offers have come my way, I incubate a dream to see if this is the correct job opportunity for me to pursue.

On one occasion, I dreamt that $I$ saw a set of dice about to be lossed. They had rlinestones ardiamands abere the black dots should be.

I interpreted this to mean that the job was a gamble, or a toss of the die. It could be lucrative, but it was a definite risk. I did not pursue this job offer.

On another occasion, I dreamt that my husband and 9 bolls were aworking for the company that had offered me a pasition. (2) had to sign up to wolunteer to work at a maralion. $\pi_{y}$ husband was more enthusiastic about wolunteering than 7 was. linterpreted this to mean that the job would be a long haul with very little income. I chose to pass on the offer.

During this past June I came upon an opportunity to run my own business. The more lexplored the concept, the more excited I became. It seemed that I had at last found the correct occupation that would make use of my talents. The dream I had to clarify the pursuit of this occupation was as follows.

## Dream Inspined Poecory

## Music of the $\mathbb{S}_{\text {P }}$ heres <br> A child has Light guiding bis life with talents gifted from gods he dances to their music <br> Arranged melodies, composed by whispers to the ear, play bim as wanderings of fancy, adventure, imagination

His eyes smile and they belie his inspiration
Fairies and elves, His keepers and helpers;
Allies as bretbren are drawn unto
his wonder'd world
Beasts and forms of Earth both seen and not encourage him to 'do the magic'
The Mystery of Earth doth trickle off his hands
It glows and glimmers as marvelous alchemy
The young master as apprentice to Earth Mother's kin Becomes known as the host of noteworthy accomplishment

He shares the craft with his company of friends
Eyes sparkle, wide smiles yield to laughter
A splendid circle of being surrounds the collected host
He gifts those gathered about him with his best
knowing what's given is received
The currency one yearns to save to give is the Music of Light, of Life
The Light of this sphere which allows a joyful noise, ... is LOVE

Poetry on these two pages
by Ivan L. Hughes, Maplewood, MO

## Drean Insyureo Porecry

As a Man Sowetlh, So Shall He Reap

Bear down upon my soul, Inflate my being from within, Fill my spirit with color and form.

The instrument delights the medium;
As when a textured, tinted shade Flows from a palette of nuance.

Even as the unicorn bows down And touches with his fabled horn Those muddied waters, Imparts healing to the troubled soul. . .

Accompany my sleep with dreams of
Visions which inspire me conscious.
The melody delights the Eye,
Paints dreams with words that have no meaning
But tone and tune, thoughts and feelings,
Impressions a beginning
Only to further description
Within boundaries of meaning.
Illumined by the Touch
Which offers lighted purpose, The vessel delights in knowing
That surpasses human understanding;
Of the songs without words
Of the poetry that hints
Of the voices sublime.
Honor the dream of 1-27-99
Tlle Observer, Tlue Witness
She sits as 'Silent Being' in robes of earthen grey, shaded tones of cloud-white. A vestige royal and handmaid, too. Species-specific, vestigial eyes focused and functional, still.
Beyond the gravity of time, Between a photon's breath...

She attends enfolded
layers of knowing within 'timebonoured' clarity
Not by doing ; simply by being ...(whisper)... Herself.

DREAMNG NSKLTS INTO RELATIONSLIPS:
B GOD SVEATE GEEDS
IS LE A DREAMBOAT OR A NGLTTMARE?
(c) 1999 by Janice Bayis
Ae you and your boyfriend headed for smooth sailing or rough riding? Your dreams may have the answer. About $25 \%$ of dreams are about relationships. If you are in a male-female relationship check your dreams for an evaluation. This goes for marriage relationships too. Dreams tap all of your inner intuitions.

These dream examples were created by the individual dreamers for their individual situations. But, they show us the kinds of messages and guidance you can expect from your own dreams.

## SPOONNG

- Wince came to pick me up for our first dale. Tlived with my parvals, Grathers and sisfers. (Actually, slie fived afone The ofream family, represents all the parls of her personality). (i)fien we came back to the fiouse it seemed natural for Vince lo slay the migfit, even with all he fanily members around. "Trlly dressed wie crawled into my single-sized bed. TJe smugly, and cozily nested our legs lying on our sides
like spoons. TOle filled very nicely.
The relaxed and conlentedly, slayed logethier that way."
Ruth, the dreamer, had just met Vince. Legs are a person's foundation. Their foundations, basic life views and values, fit together nicely, like spoons in a drawer. Mark this one a dreamboat.


## TYNG TLE KNGT

A widow woman had this precognitive dream about her second love.
"Tin by a doornay in an unfamiliar himse that is my frouse in the dream. There is a large while macrame' wall hanging ithat goes fromn ceiling io floar:
It is about sixfeet wide. 7 squeal 'Oohi' Because it is so beauriful 7 walle aver to it and ripple it with my fingertips. Mly boss is watching me enjoy il, "A man, very lall, comes ap befrind me. Ican'ts see him because fie
is behind me. The lifts ine up, now 7 can reach lhe tap.
(i)e move sideways and J $\mathcal{J}_{\text {ripple my }}$ fingertips acriass the top. Sfeef very youthful. Saoke inp humming, 'Bove is
betler thie second time around. '"
Soon after the dream her boss introduced her to a very tall man. They tied the marriage knots and his love lifted her to heights of happiness she'd never known. She said, 'He makes me feel very yout hful.' Love was indeed better the second time around. Chalk up another dreamboat.

## LASTNG LOVE

These unmarried lovers were having difficulties when Diane had this dream.
" I m in bed with my bayfriend. (D)e're in the same bed bul not fouching. IJ dream 7 wake up, get out of bed and go sit in the kitchien. Im drinking fiot coffee. He follons me and says, "Th) hat are you doing out fiere?" 7say, "Xothing." "Affer awhile Ð£go to the freverer and gel some ice cream. Fle asks, "Do you really need that?" "Ig answer, 'Mom jus/ died can'lyou cut me a litlle slack?' I start crying. He comes over and puts hiss arms around me. Wi)e nialf hand in hand back to the bed. Tole make foue and it seems very real. 70)e feept mafing love. (7)e never stopped untii $\mathcal{J}_{\text {wake }}$ up. Tole did it ouer and over aqain."
At the beginning of the dream they are together but out of touch just as they were in waking life. The nurturing love (like a mother's milk) had died. Diane wasn't gett ing the nurturing she needed. It was frozen, like ice cream. This is a picture of what had happened in their relationship.

Later Diane left him. Just as in the dream he followed her. By leaving and crying Diane showed how she was feeling. He did respond lovingly to her feelings and needs. They got back together. The dream predicts a lasting and sustained love! Mark this another dreamboat.

## No CONTROL

Nancy and Jim are lovers but not married. Here is Nancy's dream.
"Jam wills Clim. Whe are making love. I realize 7 have no birth control device. Isay, 'PYease fer's slop,' "He says, "Tim almos/ready to climax, Jdon'l mant to stop.' $\mathscr{P}_{m}$ thinking 9 dan't avant to upset fim so wie cantinue. Yust before clinaring he withdraws. "Xext we are in the filchen and gim is mak- $^{-1}$ ing breakfastf far his three broilhers and me Thave a Gusiness emuetope $\mathcal{I}$ need to give to Siim. Dm afraid lo approach him while he's busy. Tast himm ahiere to put it. Thilfout getting irritaled or upset he says, 'Yustputit on the lable'"

Nancy chose the words mak-
ing love. This ext ends the meaning of int ercourse to express the way two people care about each other. She has no control and he withdraws! In their domestic situation he serves his full array of masculinity, represented by his three brothers. Nancy is out numbered four to one. Nancy said he controls by irritability or withdrawal and always puts her need for communication aside. He tables the issue. Is this any way to live, const antly afraid you'll upset your part ner? Well, I guess it's one way. But it would be a night mare.

## FLAKY TINKNG

Jackie is a divorcee in her forties. She was dating a man in his early fifties. The dream is set in a hotel, a place to stay temporarily. Here is Jackie's dream.
"My, bayfriend and 7 are in the labby of a hotel. Fle is there looking for a group of young adults. The is dragging me along by the fand not paying any attention to me. Jte goes la the pool, the young people have left. Tie go to the tennis courts, the bar and finally back to the lobby desk. He is fold that the young people left some lime ago.
"We stand facing each alher. 7 now notice he has flakes of dandruff on his glasses. Ithink this look's disgusting. Then 7 realize 7 am supposed to meel anotfier man somewhere efse. Idisengage my hand and walk outside, leaving bim befiind."
Jackie recognized the dream's picture of his pursuit of lost youth. You know the type, fifty going on twenty. Dreams often substitute one thing for another if they share a similarity of location. Thinking comes from the head but can't be seen. Hair also comes from the head so the condition of a dream character's hair may represent the condition of that person's thinking. His futile pursuit of lost youth is "flaky thinking!" Mark this one a night mare. (See Dr. Baylis's book, Sex, Symbols \& Dreams, for more information on this substituting process).

## NO BLOOD AND NO PAN

A woman friend called me when her boyfriend of a few months broke up with her. He announced that he was going back to his previous lover, a woman who had kept him fi-nancially for the previous three years. A few days before this he had told her this dream.
" $T m$ being operated on.
The doctar amputates iny penis but there is no blood and no pain."

A man's male member is the distinguishing feature that makes him a man and can sym-bolize his manhood. This guy is sacrificing his manhood, his masculinity and power. Being willing to be a "kept man", supported by a woman he is submitting to psychological castration. The woman is quite an operator. The bloodless, lifeless guy is "feeling no pain."

My friend felt she was better off without this weakling. Mark this one a definit e night mare.

In most dreams about relationships the opening scene will show the two people together. Putting the dream pictures into words and not ing what that says in st reet language often reveals the meaning. Is he a dreamboat or a night mare? Are you heading for smooth sailing or rough riding? Look in your dreams for an answer. \}

## DREAM TMES: DREAM EXCHANGE

## NTUE LAND OF OZ

(c) 1999 by Marlene King, M.A. and You!

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-36.jpg?height=256&width=264&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=1473)

Juses play a major role in shaping our world view. From our earliest memories, houses reflect what our world is and who shares it with us. Housing provides shelter and protection from our environment, safety, physical comfort - a refuge a place to go within and just be/do and take care of one's needs. It is a space that is special and highly personal and its presence is a dominant and integral image in our daily lives.

The popular story of the Wizard of $0 z$ that told about Dorothy's magical journey inta her unconscious is an example of the role that houses have in regard to how our worldviews are perceived. Dorothy 'dreamed'she was being carried through the sky on winds from a Kansas tornado and was awakened abruptly on the edge of the Land of $0 z$ when her house was propelled to earth and dropped with a thud on a wicked witch - and killing her. Dorothy's journey to 0 z and all she encountered along the way was all about getting home again - back to her beloved family and familiar surroundings.

Many dream reports I receive have to do with the houses that populate our dreams and what to do with the images, feelings and people related to them. The following is a dream submitted by a woman who inherited her parents' home after their death:
"I just realized that a VERY recurring theme in my (usually disturbing) dreams is that....
I'm in someone else's house.
Mlost of the time, the bouses are clutfered or in disarray.
I know that houses reflect my body - but that I'm "living in someone else's body" doesn't click with me. Any other ideas?" A.M.

Yes, one's "dream house" can be one's body if universally interpreted, but beneath that are also personal associations and many other layers of possible meanings. Consider that you are LITERALLY living in someone else's house (your parents') and your recurring dream theme may be pointing out that your innermost being is still dealing with the "clutter or disarray" of memories, feelings and circumstances surrounding your parents. The 'nudging' to go through the houses in your dreams may indicate your psyche's prompting to claim its own identity; in order to have that happen, you may have a desire to have your OWN HOUSE - one that outpictures YOU and not someone's else's tastes, configurations, etc. Also, the house is considered to be the "cosmic center" in religious rites of various cultures, e.g., tepees, huts, lodges, which may have spiritual significance for you, too, in terms of sacred ancestral connections.

Also, the fact that your dream houses are cluttered, messed up, may mean that you literally have been trying to conform and "live in" someone else's "stuff". You may sense on many levels a desire to move, clean out and clear out - and you are asking the "dream question" because you already are aware that this would be a healing step for you. Another aspect to consider is that esoterically we have more than one body: astrah, causal, physical, etheric, mental spiritual. Make conscious contact with any or all of these other "selves" and see how they "fit" you; perhaps THEY need some attainment, clearing out or adjustment?

Dorothy's dream search was for her home, but for you, it may be to FIND your true home. It would be important for you to ask yourself such questions as, "What does a house mean to me?" "What are the meanings I attribute to home?" "What disturbs me about my home?" "What pleases me about it?" "If I could create my perfect house, what would it look like - what would I add - what would I leave out?" "Who would I invite to my home?" "What nourishes me in my home?" By writing out your answers, you may find further clues as to what your dream houses mean for you - and even some surprising answers. \$

# NETMVORK NOUS <br> POLTICZE TOUR DREAMS 

(c) 1999 by Jaye C. Beldo

There has been much crit icism about dreamwork being an ent irely subject ive affair which has little bearing on the world at large, Some crit ics regard dreamwork as being apolitical and self indulgent, part of the 'follow your bliss' message touted by the late Joseph Campbell. Dreamwork is often times regarded as 'idiosyncrat ic' (from the Greek word meaning private mixture) and having no objective purpose. I tend to agree somewhat with these criticisms and feel the need for us to ground out our dreams in sociopolitical reality' so we can become more substantially connected with our communities, whether they be local, nat ional or global.

I suggest trying a dreamwork method which politicizes the characters and places in our dream worlds. We do not have to do this with all of our dreams of course. Some dreams are meant to be left alone to flower and bear fruit of their own accord. But there are other dreams that cert ainly beckon for some kind of political at tent ion.

Here is a recent dream I had that I politicized to see what would happen:

The Dalai Gama had died. 7 was la
Gave an audience wilf him bul am infarmed that he fras passed on by ane of the high Gamas. In spite of the neas, 7 see the Dalui Gama from in distance and he doesn'l appear to be dead al all, but samiles aarmly and unass umingly at me.

During the time of this dream (autumn '98), the Dalai Lama was preparing to meet with President Clint on, once again, to discuss the desperate human rights sit uat ion in Tibet. The U.S. Government has repeat edly ignored Tibet an's pleas for some kind of intervention and have cont inued their 'business as usual' policies by granting China
'Most Favored Nat ion' t rade st at us. The Chinese Government protested this meeting, saying that the Dalai Lama was playing tricks by trying to deceive the U.S. Government. But nothing could be further from the truth, of course, considering China's horrid human right s abuses. My unconscious mind seemed to be responding to this recent information by causing the Dalai Lama to die within the dream in order to get me to pay close at tention. Perhaps the Dalai Lama died in my dream because I have neglected to integrate him in a responsibly political way. I had, at the time, been ignoring the Tibet an situat ion for it was been too painful. It is interesting that I had at tended a Tibet an Film fest ival the night before the dream occurred. The Dalai Lama has an interesting way of working through the media and dreams as well.

I reentered the dream with the intent of integrating it int o my consciousness by polit icizing it:

Jigmore the neus that the Dalai Eama hias died and boldly go farth past the securily guards al his residence in
7) haramsala, India, I see that the Dafai Liama bas not died but rather is in a deep medilative state witf a slight smile on his face. Jgo backfout and bring some lobbyists from TOashington, D, C, into the Dalai Lama's meditation room and insiruct them to sit down and open their Griefeases. Inside are secret contracts with the Chinese Government to build nuclear reactors in Jibel, to have $\mathcal{F i}_{i}$. belan cfitdren in slave labor camps make Mickey Mouse dolls to be sold in
America for Chicistmas. 7 ga oul into the maiting room and then bring President Clinton in front of the Dalai bama. The is very uncomforiable in there. Task him to sit damen on the floor and when tie does the Dafai Gama npens his eyes and calmly, looks al alf the men in front of him. He instruets one of his assistants to bring President Cfinton a Tibetan mandafa which depicts the 'To)hreet of Bife. 'Climion unrolts the Mandala and is shocked to see that on il are depictions of his entire administrative cabinet. Some are in the flames of hiefl, others are formented by Prelas (Gungry q(bosis). The Eabbyists get very nervous, shut their briefcases and start to get up to leave. Gilinton motions for them to sit back doan. Glinton makes the following speech: "(i)e can mo fonger ignare the suffering of the Tibulan people..."
Clinfon slarls la shake and cannot speak. Same Dakimi Ingets come io Gim bul he is two immersed in pain ta notice them. I go out and bring Chairman Mlao into the medilation room and in fis hands are these shiny medalfions with corponale logas an them: Mec'Donald's, Disney, Seneral Eleciric, Monsanta. Ite drops the medallions and they spillower the floor: President Chinlon says, 'Skelelon is out of the closel isn't it?"
At this point I came out of the dream. Like Clint on, It oo was shaking. While a part of me was somewhat distressed by the imagery, another part of me, deeper inside, opened up, especially in the heart chakra. I felt a sense of relief, that finally the truth, at least within my dream, was coming to light. I sensed that what was offered me in the politicized dream is the essential message, the message that is being censored and distorted by the media which is controlled by our trans-nat ional corporations, I made sure to thank the Dalai Lama, the 'ocean of wisdom,' for his assist ance in polit icizing my dream. Doing this kind of dreamwork has helped revive my hope for the Tibet an people, that perhaps someday they will be able to return to their country and claim it as their own. I, at least for a moment, have been able to transcend my own apathy and feelings of helplessness regarding Tibet 's current dilemma, through political dreamwork.

The 'nudging' to go through the houses in your dreams may indicate your psyche's prompting to claim its own identity; in order to have that happen, you may have a desire to have your OWN HOUSE - one that outpictures YOU and not someone's else's tastes, configurations, etc. Also, the house is considered to be the "cosmic center" in religious rites of various cultures, e.g., tepees, huts, lodges, which may have spiritual significance for you, too, in terms of sacred ancestral connections.

Also, the fact that your dream houses are cluttered, messed up, may mean that you literally have been trying to conform and "live in" someone else's "stuff". You may sense on many levels a desire to move, clean out and clear out - and you are asking the "dream question" because you already are aware that this would be a healing step for you. Another aspect to consider is that esoterically we have more than one body: astral, causal, physical, etheric, mental spiritual. Make conscious contact with any or all of these other "selves" and see how they "fit" you; perhaps THEY need some attainment, clearing out or adjustment?

Dorothy's dream search was for her home, but for you, it may be to FIND your true home. It would be important for you to ask yourself such questions as, "What does a house mean to me?" "What are the meanings I attribute to home?" "What disturbs me about my home?" "What pleases me about it?" "If I could create my perfect house, what would it look like - what would I add - what would I leave out?" "Who would I invite to my home?" "What nourishes me in my home?" By writing out your answers, you may find further clues as to what your dream houses mean for you - and even some surprising answers. (\$)

## Questions

 <br> Irinity.}
$\boldsymbol{A}$above dream and wonders what in the world could be the message of those three fat people drinking tea, sitt ing cross-legged in a perfect triangle? Does this represent a three person triangular Oedipal situation? Some earlier research found that twoperson dreams are far more common, occurring $48 \%$ of the time (while in a scale I designed for our current study, two-person dreams occur only $15 \%$ of the time) - so why not, as the song says, "Two for Tea?"

Let's say, like that dreamer, you are lucky enough to be aware of the number of people, or things, in your dream. Do numbers amplify the symbols with which they occur, or add descriptive quality like an adjective? Do the numbers have meaning as numbers alone, or is there a direct connection between the number and the symbol it is associat ed with in the dream (three tractors, for example) implying the two should not be separat ed?

How much weight should be given to the number of individual dream characters in a person's dream? Might the number symbols or number of characters have a function, such as expressing or emphasizing something in the dreamer's present situation of frame of mind? Suppose we attribute magic to cert ain numbers. How does that effect our dreams?

We are a team of three women, with many such questions. I personally, am hooked on dreams but must confess to being a victim of math anxiety. So if anyone had told me three years ago that I would become involved in any way with numbers, or would volunt arily confront a problem of a sort I had never seen before, I would have thought the idea absurd, even if the project involved exploring dreams in a new way.

## Beginnings

We have studied and worked with our dreams, both individually and in group settings, for more than 15 years. We aspired to do somet hing original, to try the road not taken, and decided to collect 100 dreams containing numbers from a resource group we had at hand. While we realize that all dream symbols have primary significance for the individual dreamer, we hope to discern some broad patterns from our sample.

We three women, members of a Jungian association in Cincinnati, requested so-called number dreams from fellow members of the association, all of whom, like us, participate regularly in various dream sharing groups. They provided our sample, remaining anonymous, alt hough identification details tell us the group consists of 12 women and 4 men, all Caucasian, six are less than 50 years of age, while ten are over 50 years. We devised and tried out several collection analyses and embarked on an exploration. This article demonst rat es where our path took us.

Our focus "the occurrence and meaning of numbers in dreams," was chosen because it seemed defined. But as we reviewed our sample, we realized that working with the numbers occurring in dreams was not as objective as we initially supposed. It was not precisely bounded, like paint ing by numbers, but very complex. It behooved us to be cautious in making observations, as those of us in the Western world are generally focused in our conscious minds, which like to take things at face value.

The dreamworld is different, for the language of dreams is largely symbolic and we have lost touch with that language. I believe we in the modern world are undergoing what writer and explorer Sir Laurens van der Post, (Jung's close friend), called "the great hunger for meaning." Life is messy, arbitrary and unpredict able and so we crave the opposite. In attempting to discover what numbers in dreams mean and even more by studying our own dreams as a lifelong endeavor, I would guess we seek to underst and our meaning and the meaning of life in general.

Dreams reveal what lies behind the looking glass of everyday life. Put differently, in waking life, we are said to act out the same wishes and fears that determine the content of our dreams. Our impossible dream was that we might span the gulf between everyday thought processes regarding numbers and the manner in which number symbols appear in dreams.

## Comments

Numbers are symbols because they stand for quantities. And, further, when numbers appear in dreams, evidently they often appear in a disguised, metaphorical form. One such disguise could be a triangle, composed of three angles and three sides.
I found myself captivated by the manifest content, numbers and symmetry of the abovementioned triangle dream. It st ood out from all the rest. The triangle gives ever greater emphasis of the fact that there are three parts to the dream and three characters, thus underlining the number symbols with a metaphorical image. Moreover, I concentrate on the triangle dream because its elements render it ideal as an example of how a specific number in a dream (three in this case) may provide some hints as to how to amplify the symbolism by various

means to gain deeper awareness of the dilemmas of our inner lives.

Study of the dream recalls to mind that the basic pattern of relationships within a family is triangular, involving the mother, the father and the child (fundamental Oedipal situation) and is the pattern from which all future relationships develop. (More about this later.)

## Our Team Data

As we worked with our data, some striking configurations emerged. While the numbers one through nine are fairly equally represented in the out er world, in telephone numbers and zip codes, for example, this pattern is not present in the dreams in our study. Although numbers one through three are well represented, numbers above four appear seldom and the higher the number, the less frequent is the occurrence.

In our dream sample, numbers associated with people must frequently feature the basic, primary numbers of one, two and three. (On my scale, the overall average number of specific characters per dream, including mates and females, is 3 , for both female and male dreamers.)

On another not $e$, if we take the fluctuating groupings of people within the dreams (including the dreamer as part of the number when appropriate and using the inferred method) , we find the number two comes up most often with 134 specific pairings, 78 of these pairs involve one male and female, followed by 47 comprising two females and 6 comprising two males. Number one, a single person, usually the dreamer, is represented 72 times. Number three comes up next most frequently with 57 specific groupings of three people.

At the number four, our data shows a divergence from the outer world. Groupings of four, five and six people occur 14, 6 and 2 times, respectively. After this, we find groups of people with no number specified, in about $1 / 3$ of the dreams.

Again, reviewing dream character fluctuation in over $80 \%$ of the sample, there is considerable movement of the numbers of people within a dream. For example, a dream may start with a grouping of two or three people and change to another grouping of one, two, three or four, and so
on. Some dreams have as many as five, six, or seven different sequential groupings in one dream.

While our data shows a wide range of additional numbers, from 5 through to 6 billion, many occur very few times or, in the majority of cases, only once. Exceptions are seven, nine, ten an twelve, for which frequencies are reported later. Often these higher numbers are associat ed with time, measure, ages, objects, money, etc. This analysis confirms the preponderance of the numbers one, two and three.

As mentioned, our dat a shows 57 groupings of three people. Besides, evidence from our sample shows that today's dreamers reflect the time-honored notion that 'the third time is the charm.' The triangle dream at the start of this article is just one instance. It reiterates three in three at tempts to get the tea right and success occurs in the third part, as three people sit "in a triangle, a perfect fat teadrinking trinity."

Three may symbolize completeness and fulfillment, or possibly the resolving of conflict between two opposing psychic forces. Our data reflects the number three occurring sufficiently often to be consistent with waking concerns and to coincide with the universal dayworld occurrence of number three.

## Quter and inner observations

The metaphorical aspect of a triangle has already been noted. Pythagoras calls three the perfect number (expressive of beginning, middle and end) coinciding with the
Jung says three
may signify that
s o me thing
is nearly but not
quite complete,
or that what is
lacking in you
can be supplied
only by some
part of your un-
conscious self
thatyou find too
frightening to
acknowledge
and use.
Jung says three may signify that so mething is neavly but not quite complete, or that what is lacking in you can be supplied only by some part of your unconscious self that you find too frightening to acknowledge and use.
dreamer's final statement. A trinity is a universal symbol. It occurs in the Christian creed and also in the Hindu creation story and Indo-European folklore. Westerners say it represents perfect harmony, while in China, it is the symbol of unanimity.

Three is a powerful number in innumerable fairy tales, including tales of three brothers who set out to make their fortune, three forays by the Dancing Princesses through a magic wood to a fairy ball, three wishes when you let the genie out of the bottle and countless other examples. Jung's colleague, Marie-Louise von Franz, who has written a great deal about fairy tales, said that normally there are three tasks (although there is usually a fourth event which happens).

Often in tripartit e folkt ales, a narrative describes an event that takes place twice with the same results, the punch line hanging on what happens the third time. As mentioned, this progression occurs, not only in the triangle dream, but also in several others in our study.

My favorite story demonstrating this mot if is Goldilocks and the Three Bears, a tale with an ancient source... where the number three is central. Goldilocks investigat es three different sets of objects dishes of porridge, chairs and beds. She has no luck with the items belonging to Papa Bear and Mama Bear. But she succeeds, (each time on the third try) with the belongings of Baby Bear.

We are confident that fairy tales mirror the most basic psychological structures of man and st udying them in relation to dreams furt hers our reflecting on both numerical and other symbols. Doing so helps release the psychic energy contained in these archet ypal, primitive symbols.

Returning to the dream data, our scales show the primitive, or lower primary, numbers one, two and three occurring most frequently, followed by number four. Further, they occur with the symbols of people, shelter, nat ure, conveyance and food. Perhaps they reflect essential human functions and needs of the dreamers, versus other cat egories where larger numbers appear with lower frequencies? Or, put differently, maybe they are not primitive so much as indicative of the way in which dreams reflect the emotional realm.

The frequency of the lower primary numbers suggests another possibility. Assuming that the psyche, or unconscious, is the source of our dreams, it seems to follow that a primitive part of ourselves may be sending us the most important number information in its more primitive form. (The mathematical spirit has been called a primordial human property).

This hypothesis is borne out by account s saying mankind's use of numbers and counting goes back roughly 300,000 years. Some early cult ures had names for only three dist inct whole numbers: 1, 2, and 3. Larger collections were called "many" and were counted in groupings of 3 . These notions fit the pattern of numbers in our dream research and the fact that $1 / 3$ of them report a group of people where the exact number is not known.

Moving from numbers found often in both dreaming and waking life to others which do not correspond. As stated, we see a difference between their frequency in our sample and in the dayworld, including the occurrence of numbers in mythology and religion, where such numbers as seven, nine, ten and twelve are well represented. This is not the case in our dream sample, In our table of number occurrences, number seven appears 7 times, nine, 3 times ten, 5 times and twelve, 2 times.

## Coming Full Circle

After scrutinizing the number symbols appearing in the 100 dreams in our sample, we are eager to believe we have achieved an inkling of their significance, although we still lack literal understanding of what the numbers mean. While we have not plumbed the depth of their mystery, we know we cannot discount their properties.

Again, we are struck by the preponderance of the primary numbers and amazed by the wide range of numbers. Almost as if we went around a huge circle to reach the number 6 billion and have arrived back where we first began, with these basic numbers. They seem to have special significance and represent something of greater complexity or intensity, like a kind of nucleus By opening ourselves to the possibilities cont ained wit hin number occurring in dreams, we have reached another level of understanding. Perhaps others will have their interest stimulated and do further work in this area.

Inferentially, the dreamer of the triangle dream at the beginning of this article was granted resolution, as indicated by its numbers and symmetry. Concluding this study, I have been granted three outcomes which have mitigated my hunger for meaning. These are: managing my anxiety around numbers, discovering some ways of accounting for what seemed unaccount able and, not least, the pleasure of creating a project and working on it with friends as a team of three. We were able to effect this study thanks to members of our local dream-sharing groups. Therefore the image of three people sitting in a small group sharing "good spiritual tea," as in the triangle dream, is symbolic. $\}$

$\tau_{2}$he number three plays a prominent role in myth, mysticism, folklore, alchemy and the dynamics of spiritual growth and change. In my dream research over the years, I have noticed that three occurs more frequently than other numbers, as a digit, a quantity, a series of actions, events, themes, patterns, or even a series of repetitive dreams.

In the mystery traditions, numbers are not quantities. They are ideas or forms which constitute the building blocks of all things in the universe. Each number has it own vibration, character and attributes, which in turn influence the physical world by attracting cert ain energies.

Three is the number of creation and ascent and opens the gat eways to the higher planes. Dreams themselves are the gate-keepers and thus vibrate to the number three. The role of the dream is to open us to new and higher awareness and expand our consciousness so that we live life more fully and express our highest potential.

The Greek philosopher Anatolius observed about three, "the first odd number, is called perfect by some, because it is

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-43.jpg?height=676&width=481&top_left_y=779&top_left_x=822)
the first number to signify the totality - beginning, middle and end." Thus, we find in mythology, folklore and fairy tales the recurrent motif of the triad: three wishes, three sisters, three brothers, three chances, blessings done in threes and spells and charms done in threes ("thrice times the charm"). Three is also the number of wisdom and knowledge in its association with the Three Fat es and the past, present and future and the ancient sciences of music, geometry and arithmetic. In religions, holy trinities express the Godhead, the All That is.

When events or synchronicity happen in threes, it is time to pay attention, for this is how the world of spirit, intuition and the Higher Self knock upon the door of waking consciousness. Thus, when three shows up in a dream, it is a signal to take special notice of what the dream is telling us.

Dreamwork about a thriceknocking turtle inspired Christian scholar Morton Kelsey to study mythology, which had a profound impact upon his work:
Istood al lbe ocean and a greal fig, very afd lurtle came oul of ibe water.

It said somelhing
very important to me....
....but as I awoke, I forgot what was said. So I reconstructed the dream in my imagination and began to fantasize. (It is most interesting to note that one can return to the dream world almost as if it were real.)
Sasked the lurtle ahtial it had said
but it did not answer; ralber, if
climbed out of Ihe waler. It went to a
toct walf and knacked on it IGree
times with its beak. F door opened
and 7 avent inside.
9 asked the lurtle what it had said
but it did not answer; ralker, it climbed out of the waler. It went to a noct walf and bnocked on it linee times with its beak. A door opened and 7 auenl inside.
Two years and 80,000 words later I came out; in this time I had lived through many of the myths of humankind with my weekly ventures into this fant asyland. Before this I had never studied ancient
mythology but now I myself had looked into this world and its images. (1)

The turtle's three knocks are the magical charm for Kelsey to gain access to a hidden inner realm and a new direction in his work.

In the following dream, the number three represents the angelic kingdom, based on the account in Genesis of three angels disguised as men who visit Abraham. The dream also involves archetypal symbols of the tree, the house and an earthquake, as well as direct audition (disembodied voice). There is an element of prophecy, which can be associat ed with the Three Fates of time. The dreamer is Robert Wise, an Episcopal clergyman, who was entering a period he described as "considerable personal loss and trial" and "overwhelming turmoil."

## In the dream

$T_{\text {was as eepp in my oan bedroum on }}$ the second floor.... Three men amoke me and pointed out of the windaut. One man said,
"Everything that can be shaken will be shaken." J was aware the s/atement uias like a biblicaf passage and the /hree men wiere holy.
$G_{\text {remembered the liree men who }}$ wisited Abrafiam by the oaks of
Mamre. Even though 9 aiasn's sure of the meaning of the moment, 7
knem 7 tuas being given a "lery special message. Suddenly the frouse began to quiver. As 3 looked out the window, the land began io mave up and dowin in wraving mofions, fike carpel being sfraken. Trees starled flying out of the ground and Itenea Ja was in the middle of a lerrible earthquake. The entire house began to suray viofently. Myy farge waterbed lifled off ibe floar and 7 was so lerrified 76 began to scream at the lop of my lungs.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-44.jpg?height=649&width=514&top_left_y=765&top_left_x=838)

Even lhough 7 was stiflasleep,
$\checkmark$ could feef my Geart pounding.
The three men disappeared and
$\mathcal{I}_{\text {remember thinking, }}$
"Å‹ will not survive the ordeal."
From somenhere a voice answiered, "ORE, but you will. You are coming to the greatest lime in your fiffe."
The house turned on its avis and faced a new direction. The iremor subsided and the Gouse sellled on a neut foundation. 7 loaked out lhe mindous at the fields beyond the edge of my property and was amazed lhat the ferrain had completely, beesi rearranged. Trees, laties and roads were fotally different. Everything aas peaceful and weflordered. (2)

The literal shake-up in Wise's life is forecast by the three angels, whose presence is assuring connection with God. The direct audition of the disembodied voice can be interpreted as the Higher Self and the "voice of God." The dream shows that the eventual outcome of the upheaval will be good.

According to Wise, events occupred just as the dREam predicted. The dream was a source of "PROFOUND INNER KNOWING" thAT GOD WAS DIfECTING HIS LIFE AND LEADING HIM TO A PLACE THAT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE bend. It AlSO WAS a GreAt SOURCE OF ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCONE WOULD BE FOR THE BETTER.

In a magical sense, "three" dreams are concerned with destiny. As in Kelsey's dreamwork, an action TAKEN OR PERFORMED THREE TIMES CALLS ATtENTION tO SOMEthing THAT MUSt be EXAMINED, PURSUED OR ACCOMplished. As in Wise's difam, a trad OF THREE PERSONS (OR ANIMALS) ARE SPECIAL MESSAGE-BEARERS ABOUT A TURAING-POINT IN LIFE, OR AN IMPORTANT REALIZATION. IF THREE OBJECTS APPEAR SIGNIFCANT N A DREAM, LOOK FOR WAYS they ARE reLated, especiALLY in TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES A WHOLE OR FORMS A COMPLETE PICTURE. In MAKING ASSOCIATIONS, LOOK FOR THE MAGICAL, THE MYSTICAL AND THE SPIRTTUAL.

Let three ofen the door to DISCOVERY! \}

by Martha Peacock
$A$wakening from a dream in the early hours of the morning, I felt unsettled. A child was going to be raped and my mother and I were willing to let it occur! "What is happening to me psychically that feels like rape?" I wondered. Over the next several weeks, active imagination, word association and other techniques helped unveil an intricate, tightly woven web of undetected patterns. Placing a mythical templat e over the dream expanded and rerouted the message into a distressing, but hopeful, history of the stifled voice of the feminine. Here's the dream:
My, deceased mother slands at a chanying lable and changes the soiled diaper of an infant girl. 7stand to her left, also at lhe changing lable. Mly brother, Mark, enters between us. The enlists my help by whispering in my ear, "You need to bact me up on this:s." Jintuit danger, but instantly push the sensation away. He then
lurns to my mother and slates in a firm, demanding voice, "Twant to lake the baby an a date." This qirl,"
though an inf ant noal, is also an immature, 20 -
somelling-year-old woman and my brolher's intention is to take her out and rape fer. Mother implies that she is done changing the babyy and the child is ready to ga. 7

Mollier seems perplexed and unsure of what to do, She thinks the babyy is ill, but Ifnow that the child is not sick. She fias ingested too many vegetables and needs la be cradled and racked.

To help unravel the intricacies of this

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_27_40ecfedabc224307bfe3g-45.jpg?height=368&width=814&top_left_y=284&top_left_x=1035)
indicating that her maternal instincts are defunct.

The infant, though a child in this scene, has the ability to change into a 20 -somethingyear-old woman - the age she will be when Mark abducts her. In addition, this girl/ woman has a slow, int ellect ually flawed peculiarity about her. Her submissiveness and imperfection makes it easier for me not to care about her well being - something I learned from my younger years: if you're not perfect, you're not worth attention.

The destructive, pessimistic relationship with my mother, or the mother archetype, is constellated in this dream. Though negative, this maternal connection offered me a form of security and safety. Because l experienced only the non-affirming side of the archetype, an encounter with the positive mother now feels threatening and destructive. The dream demonstrates this. I blindly and implicitly agree to my brother's request without knowing his intent and ignore the danger that I intuitively sense. After I learn that he wants to rape the child, I stand rigidly, my feet firmly planted facing the changing table. I repeat a learned pattern of focusing my attention elsewhere, tuning out my feelings, moral principles and the child's well being to accommodate another's request. This inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the horror of my brother's intention is also demonstrated and reflected in the zombie-like expression of my mother, connect ing a generational diffusion of emotional crippled-ness and broken maternal instincts. Though I know that the child needs the warmth of human cont act (cradling and rocking), I don't offer it.

My mother thinks the baby is ill; but I know that her diarrhea is a result of consuming too many veget ables - a sneaky indication that Demeter, the vegetation goddess, may be at work. This Geek goddess has a depressive and compulsive attribute. When Hades abducts her daughter, Persephone, into the underworld, Demeter obsessively searches for her kidnapped child. Her despondency festers and perpetuates patterns of personal torment manif ested by her long, compulsive crusade to find her daughter. When Persephone is finally released from the underworld, Demeter's joy quickly dissipates when she learns that her daughter has ingested pomegranate seeds and now must be shared with Hades. So wrapped in longing and anguish. the mother goddess cannot see beyond her personal needs and desires.

A mother's grief over the kidnapping of her daughter certainly can trigger depression. However, it is Demeter's unwillingness to psychologically separate herself from Persephone that prolongs her misery. The abduction forces Demeter to loosen her suffocat ing grip around Persephone's neck so she can breathe.

The atmosphere of my childhood household stifles me today, I clutch tightly to obsessive behaviors like the need for 'perfection' and compulsively compare myself to ot hers. Inevitably, my faults win the cont est and my failures anest hetize me from too much happiness, anger or self-expression. Much like Persephone who was trapped in the firm grasp of her mother, these old patterns must be discarded in order to inspire new life into a deadened world.

Initially, I labeled the rapist in this dream motif as destructive, negative, out to obliterate the budding feminine. But viewed mythically, Persephone's abduction into the underworld moves her soul from being Demet er's daughter to being Hades' wife. In other words, abduction is necessary to molt from a too restraining, obsolete, virginal cocoon that once tightly wrapped me in a blanket of protection.

Moving from a personal to a collective interpretation, the dream reflects the generational presence of virgin/Persephone, mother/ Demeter and crone/ Hecate. However, the mother-daughter affection between Persephone and Demeter is deadened, characterizing a culture that has lost its memory of mothering. The crone's vacant st are and her compassion-less contact with the virgin/child reveals a short-circuiting of maternal instincts. These hypnotic actions of the old woman are mirrored in the stiff, mechanical movements of mother/ Demeter and her reluctance to prot ect the baby from molestation. Mother/ Demeter is following in the footsteps of the coldhearted old woman.

The slow, retarded nature of the child, a shared charact eristic of the unhurried feminine, suggests our cultural disdain for anything that
lacks bright, masculine qualities, such as a 'defective' child, the dark side of human nat ure or the time-consuming process of individuation. The crone and mother have lost their st rength, their voice, to defend against the power, lust and thrust of the masculine. If they take a defiant stand, they will be verbally undressed and shouted back into submission further silencing their voices.

All too frequently, women who give away their power to outer authorities are frozen in a paradox. If they take a feminine stance, they risk being laughed at, ridiculed or cajoled back into their shell perpetuating their deep freeze.
Our 2,000-year history of feminine slander grounds women in the distrust of their own feelings. Hence, we put our faith into the hands of outer authorities that we believe know us better than we know ourselves.

For example, within the last century, home birt hs were believed to be too primal and women st opped delivering their babies at home. Science proved it more sophisticat ed for women to lay upon sanitary hospital beds with legs constrained in stirrups as we pushed babies out of our wombs without the gravitational help of nature. Breast-feeding was viewed as too animallike, so hard, sterile bottles took the place

of mother's nipples. Our milk production was interrupted with injections to prevent the tingling in our bosoms when our babies cried.

We are taught to ignore our instincts, no matter how our aching bodies scream for attention. Though many natural childbirth techniques have been rest ored, control over our bodies still is manipulated by outside powers. We starve our bodies to conform to advertising images that warn against fleshy thighs, voluptuous breasts or saggy abdomens stretched from pregnancy. We suck the cellulite from our dimpled legs, jog away unwanted pounds and refuse our bodies sweet cravings in order to stay in the size eight dress. We worship a pencil-thin model/ goddess and scorn the image of the round, bulbous figure of the Great Mother.

Like us, our mothers and our mothers' mothers, young girls have no role model to initiate them into the power and dignity of womanhood so they easily fall prey to shallow, misleading trends. Unaware of the archetype of the wise woman, healer and transformer, the crone, we cringe when she speaks her straight talk of clear-sighted visions. Women who don't know their own voice and try to placate, overprotect or manipulate others often shy away from this cent eredness searching for more common and comfortable surroundings and excommunicating those who have learned to speak their opinions from the musculature of their bodies.

But the dream suggests that women are feeling the pinch of their old, soiled, infantile existence. After all, the mother knows that the child needs to be cradled and rocked - proof that a trace of maternal instinct remains int act. A seed of wisdom still burns under the weakened, automated exterior of mother and crone. Deep down, the women underst and that the child must be penetrated, shocked out of her sheltered lifestyle by an underworld experience in order to transform. The frozen rigidity from unmothered, crone-lacking consciousness mourns to be thawed so a more mature union with the masculine world can be wed.

Persephone is snatched while Demeter isn't looking - or, in this case of the dream, the capacity to prevent the abduction is impossible. A healthy, well-adjust ed mother never would volunt arily release her daughter into the hands of Hades. But much like our children, Persephone must find her own way, no matter how painful the experience is for mother and daughter. Persephone will return as a different, more 'underworldly' woman. If she has a wisewoman guide like Hecate, she will learn to be a daughter to her mother and a wife to her husband.

The dream image of a changing table prompts the idea that transformation is afoot. If women - and men - are shedding their cocoons and embracing the feminine parts of themselves, perhaps our sterile, barren world will once again bloom.
