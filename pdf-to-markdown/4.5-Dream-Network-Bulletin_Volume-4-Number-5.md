## Out-of-Body Experience:

## Inside or Outside the Body?

by LINDA RAVENWOLF

In an out-of-body experience, is the dreamer really outside of his body, or is the OBE a dream accompanied by the sensation of being out-of-body? Stephen Laberge, in his book "Lucid Dreaming", proposes that "OBE's are actually variant interpretations of lucid dreams" and that "dream telepathy will provide the basis for an explanation of the occasional accuracy of paranormal OBE vision". Many researchers have similar opinions but Laberge does a good job of presenting and questioning the evidence. Even so, while reading his book, I came up with more questions.
For example, if you take it for granted that dreams only occur within the cranial activity, then a valid OBE isn't a dream and an invalid OBE is a dream; however, if by "dreams" you mean "any phenomena which we experience when the body is physiologically asleep and the mind is actively creating/perceiving images" then the OBE is definitely a dream whether it occurs inside the body or outside the body. I prefer the latter description since it leaves the nature of dream experience open.

In an OBE, I experience the sensation of being out of body. To me, the question then becomes: has the sensation been correctly interpreted? Is it a mental illusion, or do I experience the sensation because I really am out of body? How can I tell for sure?

Awake, all I know is sensation-including the sensation of thinking-- and I can never prove my thought, that is, I can't take the thought "a little black dog" and put it on the table to be weighed, measured, and verified by others. Even if my brain were dissected at the exact moment of thinking this thought, the thought can't be found; one electrochemical impulse is pretty much like another. To survive in the world, I have to take my sensations pretty seriously - but I have learned that I can misinterpret them.

Physicists tell me that matter only appears solid, that it really isn't solid at all. Should I, then, stop deceiving myself and start walking through walls? Should I deny the world of appearance and sensation? Maybe ALL sensation is illusory - an interaction of the nervous system and nuclear forces. Even if this is true, I'd better pay attention to my sensations as long as I want to survive in the sensational world!

(O.O.B. continued from page 1)

Sensation is fact. It's a fact that I feel that I'm out of body at times. NTERPRETING a sensation is theory, and interpretations are based on what we already assume to be true. The interpretation may be right or wrong, depending on whether our prior assumptions are correct, but the sensation itself is a statement of fact.

Waking, I can check most of my sensations. That may be a banana peel or a sock lying on the floor, and if I get closer, I can find out for sure. But how can I know for sure that I'm really out of body Is the current criteria for determining $\mathrm{OB}$ validity adequate? Some researchers assume that the environment in which the $O B$ dreamer finds himself MUST be congruent with his waking, physical environment, and that there can be no "dream" elements or incongruities. Why? The assumption seems to be that if an $O B E$ is valid, the person will find himself in exact physical space and time, only outside of his body. But

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_28_f533bd55aeacd116f7edg-03.jpg?height=439&width=1000&top_left_y=1182&top_left_x=39)

what if this isn't true? What if, in an OBE, the person is not in the same physical space and time that he would be in if he were in his body?

Examining my own OBE's, I get the impression that if I'm really outside my body, I'm NOT in the exact physical spacetime that I would be in if I were fully in my body.

Rarely, the distortions are minimual: once, fourteen years ago, I became very lucid when I tried to open a door and my hand kept going through the knob. I thought, "Darn, I don't have my (physical) body with me That means that I'll just have to walk through the door..." The motivation for this OBE was a piece of lemon pie. I had fallen asleep in the nurses's dorm, rondering if they had any lemon pie in the hospital cafeteria - they rarely did, and I didn't want to walk over there for nothing. $\mathrm{OB}$, I saw that they did - then thought, "Well, I can't pay for it and eat it in this condition", and immediately zipped back to my body, went to the cafeteria, and bought the pie.

Was I OB, or did I pick up the information "clairvoyantly"? If "clairvoyantly", what is clairvoyance? Apparently it's assumed by many that clairvoyance is restricted to something that happens inside the brain. But how does the information get inside the brain? If it's a reception of information, what and how am I receiving? All we know about clairvoyance is that DISTANCE doesn't seem to make any difference, and that the receiver often distorts clairvoyant impressions in line with his own concerns and preconceptions of the moment.

Other researchers allow a few incongruities in the $\mathrm{OB}$ environment but demand that if the $O B$ is valid, the dreamer must be lucid. He must question and test the incongruities. Again, why? Why couldn't it be possible to be $\mathrm{OB}$ and not know it? Does a three-month old have to understand that he's on an airplane before he can $\mathrm{BE}$ on an airplane? When it comes to dreaming, we may be in our childhood, unaware of the kind of world we're in. We don't really know much about the nature of dream reality (though we know much about the biochemical correlates during dreaming).

Testing the validity of the OBE by having the dreamer go to a physical location and report his perceptions is valid only if, in the OB state, a person really is in the same spacetime relation to the physical, or if he is able to intersect closely with it. If he isn't, his perceptions would naturally show either no correspondences or some degree of distortion, depending on how close to the physical he would be.

Usually, we verify data by bouncing our perceptions off others. "Do you see what I see?" "Can the results of this experiment be duplicated by others?" Mutual dreaming has been presented as evidence that the OBE is valid and that inner reality is (or can be) objective. The standard objection to this interpretation is that mutual dreaming could be simply telepathic-however, this counter-explanation really explains nothing at all.

Researchers demand that mutual dreamers report the same details. If they don't, then inner reality is not objective. It's certainly reasonable to expect agreement - to a point. As in mutual waking experiences, there may be some discrepancies. Two people in a room will notice different items. Psychologically,
they may each feel different1y about an event. They may argue over the color of an object, its size, or whether it was even present - and I'm talking about waking experience.

In dreaming, this problem seems magnified. Subjective ideas and emotions quickly become events and images, and if it is possible to experience valid mutual dreams, it may take much practice, emotional strength, and skill for dreamers to see exactly the same dream environment. Most of the time, the dreamer's emotional state controls him, and if he does actually meet with others, the contact may be oblique.

What I'm saying is this: we know that dream reality, whatever it is, doesn't go by all the rules of waking reality, yet in the current criteria researchers impose waking standards on it. For example, in waking life two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Is this necessarily true in dreaming? And when I say "dreaming", I am not assuming that I already know it to be "imaginary" or "objective".

Is it possible for two dreamers to be validly present in the same dream, yet one see a mountain and the other a molehill, one a tree and one a bush - according to each one's emotional state and associations? Just as we can defy gravity in dreaming, might two images be able to occupy the same space at the same time? Is the waking sensation of "space" valid in dreaming? What does it imply when we say that the whole of existence must be congruent with our waking experience? At the same time, some principles seem to apply to both waking and dreaming experience. In both we seem to structure our perception and experience according to what we believe and feel.

Mutual dreaming is a real challenge, and it happens most easily among people who have emotional ties and interests in common. From time to time I experience apparent mutual dreams with others, but there are always discrepancies.

A typical example, from one segment of a long dream, is: "I'm putting on a show for Ben (my husband) and Johannes (my son). I'm flying all over the place, doing loops and fancy maneuvers. Ben doesn't seem to be 'all here.'" In the dream, I noticed that his focus seemed slightly off-center, yet he seemed to be watching me. I wondered (in the dream) if the idea of flying disturbed him. The next morning, he enthusiastically reported that I'd put on quite a show "dancing". I described my arm and leg movements to him and he said, "That's the dancingI saw". But he also saw others in the show, and musical instruments which I didn't. Why? The discrepancies fit our personality types and interests. He has always been interested in drama and the theatre, and is musically inclined. I am neither; I enjoy music and an occasional movie, but these rarely form the background in my dreams.

Suppose that, if mutual dreaming is valid, a dreamer may not only see what is there, but may also see his projections as well, and "fill out the picture" according to his tastes, interests, concerns, and general temperament? If so, the solution would be for the dreamer to develop greater discrimination (lucidity) and learn to tell which are his projections, and which images he shares with "valid" others - and develop the emotional strength to maintain his focus. It seems to me that this would require a great deal of dedication, but it may be the only way to maintain an "objective" inner reality during a mutual dream.

How can we learn more about the nature of the OBE? Dreamers interested in this subject could (and I am following m? suggestions) by: first, developing lucidity and emotional strength (awareness and self-control) in dreams; next, learning dream skills (creating images, learning to discern possible "valid others" from self-projections, experimenting with space, time, movement, and so on. Then, the dreamer can find colleagues who want to experiment with mutual dreaming.

Right now, I confine my mutual dreaming experiments to people I enjoy being with, love, or with whom I share strong interests. It helps if you know them in the flesh- and this may be a psychological aid which won't be important later, but I need it now. I keep an open mind about mutual dreaming with people I'm not close to, or don't know well (or have never met physica11y), and have had some results. One of the most interesting experiments is to fall asleep with the intent to see whoever wants to see me the most. This approach almost always produces surprising results.

When there are enough skilled dreamers, we'11 learn more about the OBE. In the meantime, my conclusion about the OBE is that it's sensational, whichever way you look at it.

## The Substitution Phenomenon by E.W. Kellogg III, Ph.D.

In the past, men of all types have speculated as to the importance and meaningfulness of dreams. Although theories explaining dreams cover a very wide range of opinion, most basically fall between two extreme views. The first, based on a strictly materialistic reality theory, defines dreams as an entirely subjective, random replay of stored memory impressions in the brain, as a sort of mental potpourri served up to the dreamer each night having no intrinsic meaning or importance. In contrast we have the extreme opposing point of view, usually based on its proponents upon their own experience, that sees dreams as excursions into an alternate reality having just as much intrinsic validity as does physical reality. By and large, though I've had dreams which have fit either paradigm and most of the variations in between, I ascribe to the second point

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_28_f533bd55aeacd116f7edg-05.jpg?height=1417&width=881&top_left_y=1216&top_left_x=183)

of view. In this article I will describe a phenomenon I have repeatedly encountered in my own dreams that argues substantially in favor of the alternate reality theory.

To begin I have, to describe my own qualifications and orientation in dreamwork. I normally recall 3 to 5 dreams per night, and have over the past decade or so written down, interpreted, and then fairly comprehensively indexed by topic and type somewhere on the order of about 5,000 of my dreams. Of these dreams I have had several hundred that I characterize as fully lucid, meaning that within the dream I had the same degree of consciousness and free will (the ability to make conscious decisions) as in my physical reality waking state. During these dreams I have applied many of the tests for "realness" that one can make in our physical world (e.g. pinching myself, saying my name out loud, checking my body sensations, self-remembering, checking for consensus, etc.) and in every case these dreams have passed the test. Of course, dream reality has many profoundly different attributes compared to physical reality, and I do not in any way wish to make light of these differences. But from a phenomenological point of view, which bases itself in experience rather than in "theories about" experience, I have found no basis for assigning any less "realness" to the world encountered in my lucid dream state as compared to my awake physical state.

Although I characterized my lucid dream state as having the same DEGREE of conscious awareness as compared to my lucid physical state, I want to make clear here that my conscious mind in dream reality has functional differences from my conscious mind in physical reality. Specifically, and most important to my later discussion, the quality and accuracy of my "AUTOMATIC critical function of object identification" marked1y diminishes in the dream state. Thus, I will far more easily make erroneous identifications about objects in a dream environment than I would while conscious in physical reality. For example, if I saw a hybrid fruit halfway between an apple and an orange in the physical state, I would immediately identify it, at the very least, as an "odd" fruit. However, if I saw such an object even in a fully lucid dream I would most likely automatically identify it
without thinking about it as an apple OR an orange. I would have to make a CONSCIOUS EFFORT to actually PERCEIVE the object as I actually SEE it. Hence, even in lucid dreams I have to make a special conscious effort to compensate for a loss of function of my "automatic object identifier". I have learned from experience that this particular mental functon works far less accurately and reliably in my lucid dream conscious mind than in my lucid physical conscious state. Even so, I must add that within the dream state in general, I have found that my "automatic object idenfifier" works markedly better in the lucid as compared to the non-1ucid dream state.

With this as a necessary introduction, let me now describe the lucid dream I had in 1974 that led to my discovery of what I call "the substitution phenomenon". In a rather dull dream, I have a conversation with "my family in our living room in Connecticut". At this point I wake up to full lucid consciousness, and rather than simply taking off for "the wild blue yonder", I decide to carefully investigate the dream scene. I immediately notice that although the people in the living room look somewhat SIMILAR to members of my family, that they have enough DIFFERENCES that I would never have mistaken them for family members in physical reality. I also notice that the dream setting, the living room, also has a number of now obvious differences from the physical reality living room with which I had earlier identified it. Let me try to make this clear. Neither the people nor the living room changed when I "woke up" in this dream - only my ability to critically perceive them as they actually existed. At this point, I decided to go, and leaving a rather shocked looking group (I seemed to have broken the script), flew out the window to more interesting locales. Since that time I have repeatedly encountered this same "substitution phenomenon" in both my lucid AND non-lucid dreams. For example I dream of a friend, but when I wake up in the dream to a more critical awareness, I usually find I do not dream "with" my friend (the person only has a superficial similarity, and. neither really looks like my friend nor "feels" like him) but of a substitute who plays his part in my dream. Similarly, I often dream of my family home, or my apartment, yet on

## DREAMS in the Life of Prayer \& Meditation The Approach of Edgar Cayce By Harmon Bro

Edgar Cayce presented a new and exciting vision into the real meaning and purpose of our dreams. Cayce's vision saw many dreams as dealing with practical problems in our daily lives. Other dreams were concerned with changing us. enlarging our selfimage. enhancing our understanding of life, even preparing us for a fuller. clearer relationship with God.

Dr. Bro explains how dreams respond and contribute to our spiritual growth using the concepts and methods in the Edgar Cayce material. He gives us detailed instructions for awakening and understanding the dreamer in each of us.

I find the same "substitution phenomenon" in my non-lucid dreams, in that I routinely find that my interpretation of the characters and events of a dream IN THE DREAM does not correspond to the more critical identifications of the characters and events made later based on a clearly recalled dream experience. Thus, recall of dreams has two obyiously different levels. First, we have a verbal interpretation of the dream events and characters as identified DURING the dream experience. Second, we have the non-verbal dream experience itself.

I want to emphasize here that after I began to look for the "substitution phenomenon" I found it at first to occur not as the exception but as the rule in my dreams. However, after a number of years, the conscious level critical awareness I have of the phenomenon began to integrate down to my "automatic object identifier", and this has substantially reduced the occurence of the more blatant mis-identifications of characters and locations in my dreams. I believe the phenomenon probably has widespread incidence, but has remained overtly unnoticed, perhaps because most people have difficulty clearly recalling even the main features of a dream, let alone the details that don't "fit". Also, people seem to mainly focus on their INTERPRETATION of dreams and not on their actual dream EXPERIENCE. Even accomplished dreamers distort their dreams when they try to describe them, simply by boiling them down into simplified verbal descriptions. Indeed, a first approximation approach seems the easiest, and sometimes the only way to "make sense" out of a dream. Stil1, a lot of square pegs get rammed down round holes when one uses this approach. Until the lucid dream about "my family" described above, I routinely ignored the "substitution phenomenon". Understanding my dreams seemed quite complicated enough without it! However, looking back I know that I did have an underlying awareness of its occurrence in many of my earlier dreams, though I did not really give any importance to the phenomenon when it occurred.

If generally validated, how would the "substitution phenomenon" affect the materialist vs. experiential models for dreaming? First, it contradicts the main claim of the materialist theory, that dreams consist only of a random hodge-podge of stored memory images. If so, one would not expect the substitution phenomenon at all, as one would expect clearly identifiable overstocked memory images to predominate. For example, if I dream of a house that I actually lived in for twenty years, one would expect to have good and not half-baked reproductions of the house in a dream based on memory. Certain1y I can easily and clearly remember my home, family and friends accurately and in detail. In my own experience such a close identity between a dream object and the actual memory object rarely occurs, exactly the opposite to that predicted by a simplistic version of the materialistic theory at least.

And what theory do I have for the "substitution phenomenon"? Well, I suppose I favor a sort of collective dream drama society, where various groups get together each night and act out different scripts, for their own education and enjoyment. Each of us has our own individual "script", and each of us may play many different parts simultaneously - the significance of the role depending on the point of view from each participant's individual scr1pt. Of course, this would lead to a number of compromises both to the characterizations (e.g. someone who I see as a casual acquaintance may have me playing the role of his brother, etc.). This would also lead to some pretty convoluted and illogical plots (especially in regard to detalls), and to some dream stage sets that, like the federal budget, don't really satisfy anybody, but will do more or less for the time being. I don't really want to push this theory too far, but it does at least have the virtue that it explains the bulk of my dream experiences, as well as the two different levels of dream recall (of the interpretation and of the experience) referred to earlier. Perhaps I can make this point clearer by likening a dream to a play. Thus, after seeing a play, on one lharacters AS IF they actually existed as portrayed in the script. Or one can recall the play more objectively as it actually occurred - the experience itself including the stage settings and props, the actors AS actors, the costume and makeup, etc, etc. As you can see, the existence of the "substitution phenomenon" itself leads to some interesting speculations as to the nature of dream reality.

I would appreciate hearing from dreamers (particularly lucid dreamers) who have experienced the "substitution phe-
nomenon" themselves, especially as to the estimated frequency of occurrence in your dreams both before and after you gained an overt awareness of the phenomenon itself.

## My Favorite Nightmare

by Sandra A. Bruce

I have been an avid fan of my own dreams all my life and have been keeping a dream journal since 1981. However, I have almost always been a passive observer of the dream experience, never trying to plan or program my dreams. Thus it was with great surprise that I realized that a dream had answered a question, quite neatly and thorough1y, that I had just posed to myself for conscious and laborious consideration.

I had been reading a self he1p book and had come to an interesting premise. The idea was that peop1e fear becoming empowered and powerful and that this is one reason many of us unconsciously program ourse1ves for failure in our attempts to take control of our lives. "We11," I thought to myself, "why would I fear becoming empowered?" Then I put the book down and took a nap.

I awoke a half hour later from the most peculiar string of disturbing dream episodes, where everything was out of synch- rony, where everything was disturbing and in some nebulous way, threatening. It was a familiar dream feeling, the sort of disconnected dream memory that can disintegrate quickly in the sharp light of conscious thought. But that's not what happened this day because I remembered what I had read and the question I had asked myself and I knew there was a connection.

I lay still and slowly reviewed the dream, episode by episode. Then I began to laugh. Each episode was an answer, a simple picture of a different fear of what would happen if I took full charge of my own life and behaved as I wanted--what would happen if I became empowered!

The following are episodes from this dream:

1. My husband and I are in our house. The ceiling is falling down in pieces.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered the roof will fall in on my marriage.

2. I am taking a nap and both can't and won't wake up because what I am seeing in the nap is more interesting.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered I'11 become so wrapped up in the life of my mind that I'll ignore the wor1d.

3. When I do wake up I see that every clock in the house has a different time on it and none of the times are right. I try to explain to my husband that it must have been a very powerful force that could disrupt electric, battery and mechanical clocks. He doesn't see my point.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered the force will be too much for my household. A11 the systems and timetables will be disrupted. I'11 be disoriented and not know what time it is, figuratively speaking. I wil1 lose my referents to practical reality.

4. I forget to pick my son up at school. My husband somehow knows, leaves work early, and picks up both kids at their schools. When they arrive home, my husband and son are both sick. My daughter is scared. I ignore them and leave my husband in charge of the kids.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered my own agenda will become so important to me that I'11 neglect my family. I'11 become uncaring. My husband will have to shoulder more responsibility than he has the strength for.

5. I get drunk on a Sunday morning at an antique show. I am so mellow and sleepy that I proceed to sprawl across a table
display of antiques. A strange man tells me I'm drunk. I consider explaining to him but then think, "Why bother?"

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered I will disregard all standards of propriety, have no respect for traditional values, and won't even care what people think.

6. I leave the scene above and go into the ladies' room. When I look in the mirror, I see that I'm a beautiful black woman with elaborate hair, makeup, and jewelry. I am wearing a little black hat with a veil. (This description in no way fits me.) I touch the hair in surprise, feeling the difference.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered I will abandon my straight laced puritanical heritage completely. I will become so changed that I won't recognize myself. I will become very concerned with exterior appearances, adornment and sex appeal. I will become self-centered and selfsatisfied.

7. I decide to to into a Catholic church and attend a mass. (I'm not Catholic.) I walk in during the middle of the service, then change my mind and walk back out. A nice, soft-spoken nun follows me out and tries to explain to me that it's $\mathrm{OK}$ for me to go into the church during the service. I decide to be honest with her and tell her what I really think of organized religion and that I'm on1y there out of curiosity, to study it.

TRANSLATION: If I become empowered I will not respect other people's beliefs. I will be insensitive, even rude and obnoxious to the most unassuming and well-meaning people.

The lessons in these little scenarios were obvious to me. Although the exaggerations predicting disaster were funny, the fears instilled by old programming were not. However, these fears lost their power when they were forced out into the light of day. The untruths that had supported them in secret were revealed as silly lies. This dream was especially liberating.

Perhaps I will ask questions of my dreams in the future. Or perhaps I will simply remember what my questions are. There's no telling when, and in what guise, my dreams will oblige with answers.

## The Lucidity Project: An Experiment

## Group Dreaming

by LINDA MAGALLON

It is the early morning hours of December 16th and John is sleeping. He dreams of "walking though a corridor like a causeway at a large airport." His dream report continues:

"The man ahead of me sets up a stepladder to several switch boxes. I ask, "You going to work that live?" He replies,

"Yeah, just like you did yesterday." I flash to earlier in the dream and remember doing just that: replacing a breaker box in the switch. Then I remember a fragiment of a converation with a girl who stopped to talk." (JE)

750 miles to the south, I am dreaming, too, but I'm aware of the fact. I decide to take advantage of my lucidity to try and contact the other members of my dream group:

"I walk down a corridor until I come to a window. Behind it is a room filled with electronic equipment. I ask the young man sitting there if he will broadcast the names of peop1e so that they will meet me here. He indicates assent and flips some switches." (LM)

John and I have never met in person; just through written correspondence. We are members of the Lucidity Project of the Seth Dream Network. Each month we and the other members of our international group dream to a preselected target goal.

We don't often have parallel dreams. But we do have the opportunity to work on advanced dream ski11s: attaining lucidity, incubating dreams on the goal; experimenting within the lucid state.

The themes that emerge reflect the process of group dreaming. On the first dream date, we worried over the idea of dreaming with other people. The dreams contained phrases like "prob1ems of infringement of privacy"; "they need privacy", "she needs help"; "fear of the known and unknown".

But in later months we seemed to be reassuring each other:

".....he finally says, "Maybe I went too far this time". But I tel1 him "No..." (EM)

"I didn't sound too crazy, did I?" "Not too bad," she says. (DR)
At the end of the eighth month we finally said, in effect, "enough's enough!" and all sent in dreams that reflected a new, bolder stance. Fear and pain were handled quickly or dispensed with altogether. Three of us shed clothing. Sexual dream symbols included an adult bookstore, a toilet paper mask, and the act of childbearing.

As we stretch our mind muscles, we tend to remember dreams more frequent1y and of greater variety. Throughout the project all types of dreams have been reported: nightmare and anxiety, mental dreams without images; f1ying and high dreams; precognitive and out-of-body experiences. Serendipity has played its part, too.

In February I attended a meeting of another dreamworker's group. That group decided to try a telepathy experiment and I was chosen as the "sender". I went home to concentrate on a magazine photo from my dream journal. Two days later John had the following lucid dream:

"I have on a parachute harness which is connected to a balloon by heavy piano wire. Away I go into the sky. Incredibly wierd! The balloon is so far above me it is almost out of sight. I am hanging in the sky seemingly without any support. Very lonely. Surface details are lost to be replaced with others like rivers, lakes, and snowy mountains. Strange feelings of dissociation from the surface. Confidence, but still lost in the sky." (JE)

What was the target picture? A skydiver! John had picked up the photo, and he wasn't even trying. True, there had been a time lag of two days. But time is wiley in the dream state, mixing past, present and future with abandon. This makes it very difficult to utilize linear criteria to examine results.

Instead I must often use an approach that more closely approximates that of a dream artist. In August the target goal was a , dream journey to a swimming hole. I tool portions of our dreams and wove then together:

"I come across rooms that had been empty and now had peoples' belongings in them." (PS) "I'm somehow amused that I'm
dreaming of an empty room, so I start to decorate the place." (RW) "I meet 4 other persons who decide to "set the place up (decorate) for the owner...The activity involves hanging large sheets of paper up around the place." (MSE) "I was working on a large 4 panel oil painting of a large body of water surrounded by beautiful trees and plants...I attended a meeting with several peop1e." (KL) "I am coming down a wide trail on a hi11... There are bushy trees in places. I meet several peop1e." (BW) "I end up in the University....among several other people." (JE) "I wandered through a school...Saw through an internal window a class watching slides." (PS) "...watching a movie on TV. A friend1y, handsome man is explainin the art of creating reality... Telepathically, he says to me..." (LR) "(JS) and I (are) underwater in an ocean-like expanse of water." (ME) "I'm swimming with the leader out in the Atlantic Ocean. He is ...telepathing to me." (LM) "(ME) closes his eyes and holds his nose and dives in backwards... I fee1 that he will come back up...I somehow knew he would." (JS) "We saw things swimming in the ocean-perhaps turtles." (DM) "I consider taking one perfect red rose bud to the swimming hole." (SR)

The tales we tell form a specia1 tapestry of inner group dynamics. We continue to learn about ourse1ves and each other through the unique, open medium of dreams.

## EDITOR'S COMMENTS

Note the interesting sequence of how Linda develops her "dream painting". The initial background is an empty room that gradually gets decorated. People then start arriving and begin to observe slides or movies. Outdoor imagery becomes more prominent and the telepathic interaction begins when peop1e start joining in an ocean setting and swimming together, which was the targetted goa1: to meet at the swimming hole. The painting deserves the perfect red rose bud to commerate it!

## RACHEL'S DREAM

The dark serpent flicked His fateful tongue Into the face of the Calm woman, soft eyes Shining with love Unrestrained

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_28_f533bd55aeacd116f7edg-12.jpg?height=314&width=935&top_left_y=2055&top_left_x=367)

For this awesome Cold blooded thing

Pulsing with dangerous energy
Ready to strike, sinking Fangs fatefully perhaps Into soft flesh But no

It does not plunge Rather it is engulfed In the loving heart shining Through the deep eyes Steadfast and true

Alas, it lays it's head Gently upon her shoulder And submits to love.

## THE NORTHERN GATE

This man called Deer on the Mountain Now enters my dreams by night, stealthy Stalking my soul, he comes disguised As the wise guardian of the North, high up Upon the dark mountain where the old stones Lie circular, in the ancient way, round

And we are among them, within them watching By starlight, expectant, firey energy In our limbs, our hearts racing with the Shooting stars falling through the sky

He leaps up, clutching a woven blanket 'Round his shoulders so like an old Indian Ancient, housing power, energy, boldly Dancing now, leaping to the North gate Proclaiming his place of power majestically Flinging his blanket draped arms like wings Standing on the edge of time

Breathlessly I watch this dance of power The night wind chilling my naked skin I am connected to him, his power proclaimed For me, I will know the mysteries of the North

He sings his song to that sacred direction And plants his staff deep into the mountain Yarn and feathers flying in the wind

Suddenly he is approaching like a bird Running, flying, dancing, embracing me Sweeping me earthward within his blanket My breasts arch up to greet his lips My body swells with desire under the weight Of this rousing dream.

(September 10, 1985)

## NORTHERN MYSTERIES

I missed my flight up north Cheap air-fare down the tubes Cancelled holiday over stretches Where Montana lies serenely Amongst the mountains high

Deer on the Mountain called me Unexpectedly, and was secretly glad. I miss you, he said Softly. I will be your Shaman. An so you shall I whispered.

## EDITORIAL

Inc1uded on this page is a copy of the target picture I was attempting to "send" on the night of Nov. 17. I'11 be eager1y looking forward to receiving your letters describing the dreams that you had the same night or in an adjacent time zone, like the night before or after. It's a well established finding in parapsychology that "temporal displacement" often occurs in experiments 1ike ours and our dream watches don't work with perfect synchronization. I'11 report some examples of the correspondences between the target picture and your dreams in the next issue and announce who won the free subscriptions.

Henry and I have been intrigued with the possible healing effects of telepathic group dreaming for a long time. We developed our "dream helper" ceremony about ten years ago and have used it with several groups since then. An early report appeared in 1977 in a book edited by J. Long entit1ed, EXTRASENSORY ECOLOGY: PARAPSYCHOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY which was published by Scarecrow Press. Henry has written another interesting account of the procedure and some of the results we have obtained in a recent issue of the magazine Venture Inward, and an expanded version of this article appears in his new book, GETTING HELP FROM YOUR DREAMS. One of our more elaborate experiments with the "Dream Helper" ceremony used psychic consu1tants to provide a parallel source of information. Jean Campbe11 participated in this experiment; and wrote about it in her book, DREAMS BEYOND DREAMING. Her participation led her to develop a project called "Dreams to the Tenth," involving linking people through 1ucid dreams.

One of the participants in Jean's project then seeded the Seth group dreaming project described by Linda Magal1on in this issue of DNB. Readers can obtain some appreciation of the intricate tapestry woven by collective dreams in Linda's story. I'11 try my hand at weaving your collective DNB dreams together in a later issue.

We hope you'11 also participate in our "dream commentary" section. As you have no doubt guessed by now, the theme we're trying to press is that of participation by sending in dreams, short articles, art work, announcements, and subscription orders for or from your friends. We would like to see the concept of dream networking become strong1y energized and it obvious1y takes lots of you folks to make that happen.

As we move toward the coming year, you might want to think about setting the dates of June 23-30 aside on your calendar to attend the ASD Convention at Carleton University in Ottawa. Those who attended the convention in Char11otesville were very enthusiastic in their feedback comments. It's a great opportunity to take in some workshops, hear some papers on the latest developments in dreams, dress up in dream costume and dance at the Dream Ba11, and meet hundreds of like minded dream appreciators for chances to swap and share dream experiences.

Let's a11 participate at whatever level we can!

#### Abstract

"The setting is the annual meeting of my Church Board in a large coliseum-like building with many entrances. My tunnel-like gate is flooded because of high tide. I enter finally, and don't recognize many people. I choose a seat. front and center and watch an amazing performance of a Board officer playing with extra large playing cards on a wide grate (apparently suspended in air) until the audience is assembled and ready. He makes a speech designed to arouse enthusiasm at the end of which he introduces a movie with the suggestion that a source of difficulty will be removed at the end of the movie.

I have volunteered to sit in a seat where the spotlight can fall and am aware that the speaker is trying to push a large rubber snake out from under his shirt and wrap it around me. But I am not aware that the movie includes footage of me being awakened by bright light, looking startled lying on my back, nude, and two unidentified women are washing my chest and genitals with soap and water. I am to go through another tunnel to make an entrance after "starring" in this show, but it gets smaller and smaller and at the end I feel like it will close in on me from behind and not open up in front--something I try to prevent by jamming my file of papers into the hinges of the door that would close.

I wander through the coliseum, others avoiding me, until I meet F. at a lunchtable in a open dining area. I share with her the hurt that I feel. The President ofthe Board finally appears, looking thinner, and comes to shake hands. But there is no sense of apology or reconciliation. "


The dreamer is a 40 year old professional man who is married and has two children. His dream has some rich imagery and should provide an excellent opportunity for readers to speculate about what issues they think are confronting the dreamer, how well he is handling those issues, and suggestions could also be included as to what steps the dreamer might take next to deal with the issues that have been identified.

We will publish three interpretations of this dream in the next available issue. If readers find this idea a useful one, we will begin to solicit dreams from them and establish a "dream commentary" section as a regular feature in future newsletters.

## DREAM WATCH

bY THOMAS COWAN

The morning that Hurricane Gloria blitzed up the east coast, I taped my windows, stocked up on canned goods, and re-read my dream journal for the preceding few months looking for any precognitive dreams that she was on her way. Nothing. Not even a good rain dream. Actually, I hadn't expected to find any as I am not much of a precognitive dreamer. I even have trouble incubating dreams on selected topics or questions. In general I don't have very proficient control over my dreams.

It was with great pleasure, therefore, that I came across what might be considered a beginner's technique for using dreams to divine the future and discover information about coming events. In her little book titled "On Divination and Synchronicity." Marie-Louise Von Franz relates an archaic method for using dreams to discover answers to pressing life situations. In primitive societies, she says, the basic questions of life were rather simple. Should I go on a journey? Will my sick child live or die? Is my spouse deceiving me? Without engaging in subtleties, the primitive mind basically wanted Yes or No information. In many ways we are still primitive. There is still a primal spot in our own psyches that wants Yes or No answers. Sometimes we flip a coin, draw one Tarot Card, select one rune, tear petals off a daisy one by one.

Dreams can perform the same function, and it may not take advanced levels of dream control to divine such answers. If you basically want to separate lots of chaotic information, fears, hopes and desires about a crucial life question, a simple dream technique might be your first step.

Adopt the attitude of primitive folk (that is, acknowledge the primitive remnant of your psyche that wants a Yes or No answer), and as you fall asleep, request a dream to shed light on the question or issue that is disturbing you: should I take a certain job? Should I move? Should I marry this person? Should I bring up a delicate problem with someone at home or work? Should I spend all this money? In the morning take whatever dream came to you and decide if it was a Good or a Bad dream. While it's true that there are no "good and bad" dreams as such, and we know most dreams can be worked on and analyzed to reveal both "good and bad" aspects, for the sake of the divination exercise, let your spontaneous, intuitive response tell you whether it was good or bad. Don't think about the dream too much. You KNOW what it feels like for you to wake up and immediately think to yourself, "Whew, that was a bad dream!" or, "Wow, what a pleasant dream!" That's all you need to do.

As Von Franz, a co-worker with Car1 Jung, explains it, on an unconscious level, you know all things. You have a link with the collective knowledge of the universe. There is no time and space as we perceive them in the waking state. So-called past and future events are occurring simultaneously in the present Now. A11 is one. In other words, you already know on the unconscious level the Yes or No to your question. What any successful divination technique does is to bring that information to consciousness. In this case, the dred is merely the trigger or the tool to let that unconscious information surface.

By posing the question in its basic Yes/No form, you can impose a "binary order" on chaotic information swirling through the psyche in various forms of fears, hopes, questions, images, and confusing implications. The binary order is a simple yes/no, good/bad, favorable/ unfavorable, lucky/unlucky. Remember not to analyze the dream too closely because all things contain their opposites, and you may end up not being able to decide if the dream was Good or Bad. Use your initial gut feeling about the dream. If by chance you can't because your dream was riddled with both good/bad imagery, it's possible that you have not yet received your binary answer. That particular dream didn't work as an oracle. As the Indian Chief in the movie "Little Big Man" put it, "Sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't." So try another dream the following night.

Since dreams are calls to action, the answer you receive could be used to seled a manner of action or an attitude to adop, toward the situation. In its most basic terms, the dream is saying "Go to it!" or "Go slow!" It may seem that using such a primitive technique is no different than
tossing a coin. You may be rightly hesitant to decide matters of money, love, areer, or health on the toss of a coin! Usually such momentous decisions need more than a binary approach. But the Yes/No approach is a good starting point for learning what your unconscious feelings are about an issue. Heads and tails are valuable. If the coin comes up heads and your gut reaction is, "Oh, no!", you've brought to a conscious level your current feelings about the matter.

If, on the other hand, your initial reaction to heads is, "Whew, thank goodness!", again you know where your deepest sympathies . lie. In both cases you've learned something you didn't previously know. And that's the point of divination.

You may want to take the divinatory dream a step further to address the subtleties and complexities of your question. Like the Chinese, consider the negative or positive dream answer as a CLUSTER of qualities. In fact, to avoid the terms "negative and positive" altogether, decide if the dream was primarily a Yin or

Yang dream. Which of your dream images re Yin and which are Yang? Traditional1y, Yang attributes included: male, light, active, sky, open, hard, firm, and so forth. Their opposite Yin attributes included: female, dark, passive, earth, closed, soft, yielding and so forth.

Once you've determined the Yin or Yang quality of your dream, your dream-answer takes on richer dimensions. As a call to action it can advise you, regardless of its content, of the specific attitudes or roles you might play in the situation. A Yin dream might suggest: be yielding, get more light on the matter, let things take their natural course. A Yang dream might suggest: jump in there, take the initiative, be aggressive, don't bend.

In other words, the divinatory dream calls up a certain beat or rhythm for your response to the situation or question. It gives you a mental set for thinking about and acting on the issue. It offers a certain style for encountering the problem in waking life.

Wi11 this work for you? Hard to say. Even the I Ching isn't for everyone. Try it and see if it works. Learn what your Good and Bad dreams are like. Test them against your questions. Discover your own success rate so you know to what extent you can trust your dreams when worked with in this way. A piece of advice offered by many psychic readers should be kept in mind: divinatory techniques usually on1y work on vital, critical life questions. They may not give information on trivial issues like, "Should I wear red tomorrow?" or "What movie should I see on the weekend?" or "Will a hurricane wipe out Brooklyn?"

If all else fails, remember the Romans used this dream technique sometimes with great success. Do as the Romans did: if you have a bad dream, it's an unlucky day. Stay in bed. Don't go to the Senate.

## DREAMS AND COMPUTERS

I read with great interest the article in DNB pertaining to the indexing of dreams through the use of a computer. I have a Macintosh Computer, and I use the software product FACTFINDER. As the example enclosed shows, the FACTFINDER will effortlessly index all dreams, list all dream symbols (key words), give the frequency of occurrence of the symbols, and will search and retrieve dreams of particular interest (those which satisfy the search instructions you enter).
I have been using my computer with my dreams for some time and I find it very easy to do. I believe writing out a dream work sheet on the computer helps to analyze and interpret a dream. It also facilitates effortless reviewing, study, changing, and updating as the scanning process is immediate and you don't get lost in a pile of paper or notebooks. The filing program is efficient and lends itself to an immediate printout of pertinent data.

## A DREAM COLLECTOR

I am a graduate student in guidance and counseling at Southwest Missouri State University. I am using my long-time interest in dreams as a kick-off point to do research for my master's thesis.

I am working on dreams collected by a local man for nearly 18 years. I hope to find a woman who has collected dream information for a number of years, to make a statistical comparison.

I am also collecting dream information, in the form of a questionnaire, from as many people as I can. If I find enough willing dreamers, I will try to make some comparisons between my long-term data and the experiences of a wider group.

If you are willing to help me with my research, I would be happy to send you a questionnaire, and/or correspond with you about your dream work.

## DREAMS AND EMIGRATION

Marc Chagal1 is a good example of how old memories and dreams can stimulate an artist to create beautiful paintings. [ED: Two of Juhani's drawings from dreams--computer drawn "MacDreams"--appear here in DNB.] What percent of Chagall's fantastic paintings comes directly from his dreams is difficu1t to say. He worked in France but was born in Russia. Most of his paintings show views from his home village with flying people, houses, flowers and animals.

A man who emigrates never gets completely rid of his roots. Dreams don't respect national boundaries, customhouses or travel agencies. I came to Sweden from Finland in 1980 and could already speak Swedish. Some interesting facts emerged when I examined my dreams from that time
Of my first 80 dreams in Sweden (Aug.-Dec.), $70 \%$ involved a setting in Finland, $10 \%$ a setting involving both countries, $8.75 \%$ a Swedish setting, $8.75 \%$ a setting combining Finland plus another unidentified place and $2.5 \%$ of dreams were impossible to locate--they cou1d have taken place anywhere in the universe. Overall, Finland figured in some way in $90 \%$ of my dreams after I first arrived in Sweden.

The difference between Sweden and Finland is quite sma11, both economically and politically, so a more remote place like Egypt or China would have provided a more marked contrast in settings.

This kind of finding interests me and I hope DNB attract reports of similar experiences, or upon questions such as, when does the new language take a major part in "dreamwork"? [ED: Years ago a magazine reported that Peace Corps volunteers noted that their dreams took several months to reach them at their overseas location.]

## DREAMS: NIGHT LANGUAGR OF THE SOUL

Phoebe McDonald. Mosaic Books, Baton Rouge, LA. 1985, . \$19.95, 233pp.

Ms.McDonald graduated from the David Seabury School of Psychology in Los Angeles and has been a personal counselor in the field of psychoanalysis for over thirty years. The author discusses some of the key Freudian and Jungian concepts regarding dreams but pays practically no attention to other dream theorists in her comments or bibliography. Although Ms. McDonald includes a large number of dreams in her book, they are generally handled by giving a few brief associations of the dreamer and the author's interpretative remarks, which frequently stress a sexual or instinctual issue.

THE MYSTIQUE OF DREAMS<br>G. William Domhoff. University of<br>California Press, 1985, \$14.95, 146 pp.

Dr. Domhoff is a Professor of Psychology and Sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In this book he explores how Senoi Dream theory became popular in this country and speculates upon reasons for its quick acceptance even though it was based almost entirely on some popular anecdotal accounts provided by Kilton Stewart. Domhoff does an excellent job of investigative reporting on Stewart's life and travels and documents how sparse a data base Stewart had for his greatly exaggerated claims about the role of dreams in Senoi culture. He also presents a interesting sociological analysis of the attitudes towards dreams in our culture.

HENRY REED'S

DREAM JOURNAB

## SHRINE INCUBATION

Among the forms of dream incubation, perhaps the oldest variety is that of "shrine incubation," which is a ritual of going to sleep at a special shrine or sanctuary of a divine beneficiary, such as the classical of "temple sleep" at Epidarus undertaken by ancient Greeks to receive a dream blessing from Asklepios, the divine physician. Although most dream psychologists today would emphasize the auto-suggestive component of intentionally solicited dreams ("dream induction"), the original mystery of divine intervention in the incubation of dreams continues, nevertheless, to exist. Reporting in the journal, Psychiatry ("In search of the Saddiq: Visitational dreams among Moroccan Jews in Israe1," February, 1985, 48, 83-92) two Israeli aniversity behaviorial scientists, Yoram Bilu and Henry Abramovitch describe the dream incubations occuring today at the shrine of Rabbi Shimeon Bar-Yohai (second century mystic and author of the Kabbalah), which para1lels in many respects the Epidauran pattern of incubated dreams. These researchers spent three years (1980-1982) collecting 200 dreams from religious pilgrims participating in the annual veneration festivities of this Jewish saint at his enshrined tomb near Safed, Israel.

The dreams collected were "visitational" in nature, involving the appearance of the saint in "true to life" form, just like his depiction in popular pictures, or in symbolic guise, such as a powerful animal, but most frequently as a physician (reminiscent of Asklepios). The saint typically initiates the interaction with the dreamer with the commanding salutation, "arise, arise!" The ensuing transaction between the saint and the dreamer is the vital part of the experience, as most pilgrims are anticipating, not necessarily to dream, but to enter into a "therapeutic alliance" with the saint. For many, who were initially ambivalent about making the pilgrimage, the saint appears in a dream prior to the pilgrimage and insists upon their participation. Such "invitational" dreams reaffirm the importance of the pilgrimage and insure its faithful continuation. For others, whose dreams materialize on the site of the shrine festivities, the nocturnal visitation of the saint is directed to resolving some life difficulty confronting the dreamer: infertility, the naming of a child, the protection of family members active in the military, the overcoming of economic difficulties, as well as the healing of specific illnesses. The purpose and impact of these dreams, according to the authors, is to establish a direct connection between the pilgrim and the saint and thus reaffirm the active practise of the faith in a time of increasing "modernity."

The authors further note that a primary characteristic of these visitational dreams is that, in contrast to ordinary dreams that are cast at a time and place unrelated to the dreamer's current situation, these incubated dreams are cast in the "here and now," occuring at the dreamer's bedside. my own original experiments in drea incubation, I demonstrated that the archetypa1 power of visitational dreams remains potentially active among today's westerners who may not "believe" in either shrines or deities ("Dream Incubation: The reconstruction of a ritual in contemporary form." J. Humanistic Psychology, 1976, 16(4), 53-70). In those experiments, I also observed this very same "here and now" quality--the hallmark of the visionary incubated dream.
