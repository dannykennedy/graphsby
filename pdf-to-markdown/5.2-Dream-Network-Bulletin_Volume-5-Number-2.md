Recent experience has led me to wonder if a new artform is evolving. Perhaps there is an artist in us all, who weaves our dreams into a composite tapestry from which we can each draw nourishment.

Since I have jolned a dream group effort in Washington, D.C., I have noted an interesting phenomena. The group as a whole seems to work, from week to week, all on the same theme. There is one member of the group who has had several dreams in which we will appear. These dreams seem to summarize or focus on a particular idea which is surfacing in all of our individual dreams around that time.

Several months ago, I was asked to Join a second group. Much to my amazement, what I soon discovered, was that the two groups were on the same theme, week after week, even though they had no connection with one another. Further, other sources $I$ came in contact with also seemed to be wrestling with similar issues.

All of this is making me more and more aware of the Importance of the entire dream community to the task of understanding our own individual dreams.

When a person asks me to give an opinion on a dream, I have found it useful to place myself in it. When I first began doing this, I would take a single dream at a time and work it as if it were my own. When I did this, I often came away with useful insights into my own.

It was almost as if someone else was sent my dream because, for some reason, I was unable to receive it on my own nightly dream screen. Some other person acted as my television monitor, recording it for me for replay at a later more convenient time. 1 began spending more time on other people's dreams than my own.

Last week, there were so many other people's dream presenting themselves all at

## EDITORIAL Bob Van de Castle

This issue contains the results of another readership project - "What do you think this dream is saying?" There simply wasn't enough space to include all the material sent in but I hope the drastically reduced excerpts will give you some feel for the material.

There were as many different interpretative emphases as there were respondents, although some commonalities and overlap were detectable. Such an exercise should remind us to remain humble whenever we confront the magical and marvelous quality of dreams. They can contain such incredibly rich images and metaphors for revealing how an individuals unconscious is processing the unresolved and unassimilated experiences of yaking existence.

1. want to acknowledge, with deep appreciation, the response to what many have labeled "my sauna editorial." We received two extremely generous contributions $\$ 300$ and $\$(0) 0)$ to help us continue our efforts to expand the network of dream appreciators. Several people also offered to share computer equipment or came up with ideas to promote awareness of DNBS existence. We have recently prepared a DNB flyer and would be delighted to send some to you for remailing or distribution at meetings or for posting on bulletin boards at schools, churches, or other community centers. Let us know how many you would be willing to take responsibility for and we'll gladly mail them to you.

You'll notice that were undergoing further internal reorganization. Editorial contributions or material will continue to be sent to me in Charlottesville, but all subscription renewals and financial items (buying back issues, etc.) should now be sent to Lyn Reed at 503 Lake Drive, Virginia Beach, Va. 234jl.

Judging from some recent phone calls from reporters, JNB is beginning to achieve a faint glimmer of national recognition. We clearly need your backing to help that light became brighter. I always ask these reporters if they will try to give UNII a plug in their article so that more folks will have a chance to read about us. That us isn't just the Van de Castles and Reeds; its All of us dream appreciators. Is there any door you could open so that the DNB light might shine in?

I don't like the role of always being cheerleader for DNB and asking you in the stands to give me a $D$ and now give me an $N$ and now a B but, frankly, youre the difference as to whether we'll still be able to suit up. We think were bringing out a better and better product, both content-wise and appearance-wise. but we need more attendance in the stands. Can you bring a friend along or talk about the Dream Game (forgive me, Anne Faraday) to some folks who might be interested? Yea, team, yea!

## Continued from Page 1

the same time, I declded to try doing a composite essay including a bit or a plece from each dream, around a single theme. As I was working on this, events which had occurred in dreams I had had in in years past, surfaced. It was as if, holding old dream symbols up to the light cast by new dreams, caused me to be able to see and understand things in a way, up until now, I haven't been able to do.

Let me give you an example of fresh understandings. Several years ago, at the time of my sister's death, I had three dreams. In one, there was a scene in which she was walking into a center where she was going to watch a play. I had this dream the week before her death. Tbe next, showed her holding a beehive golden crown and at her feet were two golden cavemen clubs, as she stood in a flaming fire. The last, showed her "going to work" In a dressy gray sult with a scarf around her neck, just hanging down on either side In front.

I realized that the analogy of the beehive seemed to fit in quite well here. Up untll now, I had connected the crown and clubs only with the word "anclent," since I had seen this crown on a trip several years ago In Mainland China. It was part of the digs of the Ming Tombs. I remembered, for the first time, that we also visited a ruin of a matriarchal primitive society which had existed along the river beds in XIan and could be connected with the clubs. The scarf in the last dream seems to have no connection with China, but I did suddenly see an association with the prlest's stole.

I am enclosing the composite essay, I wrote on the "dreams of the week." These were all women's dreams. The notion of a female Godhead who plays the roles of many women in our dreams came to me from the dream of the woman in the royal blue dress. Not mentioned in my essay, is the fact that the dress was clearly a costume. Since there were an Infinite number of the same woman in the dream, it seemed to me to point to a divine nature. The "bull" started out in the dream as a black "cow" and turned into a bull only after she had left the rest of us riding off on the back of this animal. The Monday night group was in this composite dream which follows:

How does one see God? Imagine you have the eyes of a honey bee. You see a kaleldoscope of tiny pictures. Each one is a facet in a complicated mosaic. You see her image on your dream screen every night. Sometimes she plays yourself, but she is such a great actress and plays her part so well that she is difficult to distinguish from ordinary life.

Anytime God interjects herself into our lives, it is a small miracle. She picks the symbol she uses for a purpose. She is Instrumental in enabling us to see the essence of a situation or discover a quality within ourselves.

It's not polite to talk about it: the real matters of the heart and mind. It's an
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_01_0544b681119bd1f1222fg-04.jpg?height=1836&width=1313&top_left_y=100&top_left_x=780)
> ...anytime God interjects herself into our lives, it is a small miracle. She picks the symbol she uses for a purpose...
embarrassment. We are afraid. It is difflcult to trust God, especially when she frequently does not follow the customary norms of etlquette, about how we would like God to be u act.

Take her role as Queen of the Night. She is seated at a table which stretches to infinty. With your bee eye you see an Infinite number of the same likeness of her. She wears a royal blue party dress with black feathers epaulet-like on her right shoulder. (Mother has a dramatic flair.)

The moonlight streams in upon her. She is often associated with the moon. Our word lunacy comes from it. It is apropos. When she is around, things tend to get a blt crazy, but never dull. Suddenly you are suized with a fit of laughter. You relieve yourself, in more ways than one. It is akin to a yawn when you feel tense. This is serious buslness. Or is it?

While the male godhead is the trinity, mother is the invisible base. She is the three-legged stool turned upside down.

Our Queen of the Night plays on our dream stage mightly. She has an affinity for birds, especially black birds, although right now she is playing at the Kreeger as a Wild Duck. She is always associated with freedom and shows up in the prisons of our minds and hearts. One night one woman found herself perilously perched on her back. Mother was a black bull about to wind upl

Women, in general, don't know what to make of her. Womankld-like, we are afraid to clumb the stalrs to look for her. We glimpse her dimly behind a window. Intuitively, we hesitantly reach to touch
that true side of ourselves reflected in her, but we are easily blinded by the glare and dizzy from the height. We teel such tenderness and love for this precious, preclous core of ourselves. We are protective of it. It has lain hidden in the desert of our dreams over the inillenna.

Another problem is that sex is always associated with Mother. After all, she's the queen beel We are terrified of these animal energies within ourselves. Somebody might be looking and see us or hear us expressing our pleasure. What then?

What about the Medusa? Blood can nourish us, but it can also be violently strewn. How can we harness her energles creatively so we don't accidentally blow oursclves upl

She prefers to be faceless and nameless, as she uses fire to burn us back to our natural elements. She will clothe us with the jewels of her values. As ancient Wisdom, she may drive a charlot of wild horses or perhaps she'll choose to show up unexpectediy in a taxil

She is black and white, but she is also gray. She has a matched set of pearl luggage. She loves scarves and wears them well... Sometimes draped like the stole of a prlest. She wears gorgeous snake shoes. Carrying a healling stick and an armful of red roses, she walks sedately towards the center where she will gleefully watch the drama she has created unfold. If you go secking her, be prepared for quite a ridel She's as Irrational as Hell.

# A NIGHTMARE FANTASY FOR CHILDREN 

BOB TROWBRIDGE

I designed this nightmare fantasy to give children an experience of their ability to overcome their nightmares. I have done the fantasy with hundreds of children (and adults) in schools, churches and conferences. In most of these situations I was not able to do any follow-up with the children, but clearly it would be possible to work within the framework of the fantasy one to one to help the child overcome whatever fear the fantasy represents.

The fantasy is very simple and can be modified for your own work. I always explain ahead of time to the children exactly what we're going to do. This helps relieve any anxieties and allows me to give minimal instructions within the visualization itself. I never do a long relaxation for this or any other visualization work I do. I find it isn't necessary and I like to impress people with the idea that this symbolic information is easy to get and is right near the surface.
"You're walking on a path through the woods. You're by yourself but you're feeling good and enjoying the scenery. Gradually the woods get thicker and a little darker. You think you hear a sound off in the woods. You begin to feel a little more nervous. Then you hear more sounds in the woods and something seems to be coming your way. You begin to become a little frightened.
"The sounds get closer and closer and you begin to walk a little faster. All of a sudden you hear the sound on the path behind you. You turn around and see your nightmare monster coming after you. (The children create their own nightmare figure. It's far more meaningful that way.) You begin running and he chases you. You're frightened and run as fast as you can, but the monster is faster and is catching up.
"The monster is just about to catch you when you decide to stop running away and turn around and face your monster. Face your monster now and fight him until you overcome him. (This part is tricky. I'm fundamentally against violence and the use of weapons. Trying to kill the monster is difficult to deal with. Weapons turn out to be an excellent indicator of the child's sense of power or powerlessness, but it may be best to just instruct the children to fight and overcome or "beat" the monster.)
"Once you've overcome your monster, ask the monster for a gift. When you get your gift, open your eyes and remember your experience."

When the children do kill the monster, the monster always comes back to life to give them their gift. Sometimes the monster is transformed into something or someone else. You can see that you could do some valuable work within this fantasy framework if you have the time to work one on one with the child.

The fantasy is an excellent diagnostic tool for determining just how powerful or fearful a child is feeling at the time. If you know that a child is particularly fearful or feels powerless, you can use the fantasy to deal with the fears.

You can tell the level of powerlessness by the size or type of weapon used if the child uses weapons. You can also get an indication by seeing how easily the child overcomes the monster and whether the child is hurt in the encounter. Two bullies in the same second grade class were actually killed by their monster. Parents and teachers often don't recognize that these "problem" children are actually trying to compensate for fears and feelings of powerlessness.

The gifts the children get are always interesting and could be worked with in a one on one situation. Children are wonderfully literal and often come back with wrapped packages. When I ask what their gift is, they say that they don't know yet because they haven't opened it. Whereas young children frequently come up with obvious things like money, pets, toys and other things of value to them, older children sometimes get quite symbolic gifts which can be "opened up" using dreamwork techniques.

If you find the nightmare fantasy helpful, I would love to hear about your experiences. If you have problems or questions I would like to hear those, too.

# Dream Realizations Experiment 

Part One<br>LINDA RAVENWOLF

Illustrations by Norma Churchill

In May 1985 I finally ordered Henry Reed's Dream Realizations, a 28 -day dream Incubation workbook. I knew that I'd learn something, but I didn't expect the discoveries to continue for months afterwards.

The workbook is designed with the basic assumption that "dreams will speak to those Issues that occupy your mind and your efforts during the day." You have to do as much daytime work as dreamwork by perlodically clarifying and reassessing your dream quest, formulating best guess solutions, making daily contracts, and writing plllow letters. At the end of each week, on study night, the workbook guides you naturally through dreamwork methods.

I can't begin to tell the whole story in a short article, but $I$ can give an overview of the process as I experienced it.

WEEK ONE: 1 recorded my dreams and contemplated my dream quest at odd moments during the day and at bedtime: "This possible move to Callfornia--what should I be aware of, take care of, consider?" I had some big declsions to make, and I wanted all the dream input I could get to go along with daytime of ormation.

Key Dream: "My name Is Anna, and I'm a young, dark-haired girl wandering around In a Walt Disney forest of fantastlc colors, music, and animated nature. Everything is alive, full of possibilities. This is my true homel I feel a great sense of adventure and the desire to explore. Whatever the consequences, this is what it means to live.
"Now I'm Linda, my regular daytime self. My husband and I are on vacation, driving to Connecticut, when suddenly I realize that we forgot our son. Ile was still asteep in the motel when we left, and we forgot him! In anguish, I tell my husband that we have to go back now and get him. We drive and drive, and I begin to wonder how many days away he is."

I didn't know that this dream was a key dream untll the end of the month. It didn't seem to have much to do with the move. But my Anna self, who understands that fantasy is inner fact, was just the right companion 1 needed for facing the unknown. She is naturally intuitive, Imaginative, and resourceful. I realized that I'd always felt embarrassed about Anna and tried to keep her out of sight. She was no Walt Disney who could turn fantasy Into cash, thereby making it socially acceptable.

By the end of the week / had hcovered my fears about moving, self-deception, indecision, and finances.

"I had some big decisions to make \& I wanted... input..."

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_01_0544b681119bd1f1222fg-08.jpg?height=887&width=1096&top_left_y=100&top_left_x=92)

# "O.K., I thought, Intuition comes from within and we are our own midwives. What else is new?" 

Dream excerpts: "I'm wandering around at night in a big city, and I only have five dollars, not enough for the groceries we need." "is that woman liberating those South Americans, or is she selling them into slavery? I feel very upset because I don't knowl I walk up to her and angrily demand to know the truth. She Just looks at me indifferently." "I'm a sandy-halred, blue-eyed woman living on another planet. I'm an artist and I've created something people don't understanct 1 feel very lonely." "I'm trying on some fancy blouses, and I'm uncomfortable because they don't go with my Jeans, but I want to wear them both." (The blouses, I'm sure, represented California, and the Jeans, Alaska.)

I examined the unpleasant dreams and began to wonder: which ones were precognitive, in the general sense of supplying valld information--data 1 could use for 3-D decision-makingl--and which ones were "self-knowledge" dreams, pointing out unnecessary fears? Given what was at
stake, it seemed important to be able to tell the difference.

WEEK TWO: My quest: "How can I recognize intuitive knowledge? How can ! distinguish it from self-knowledge dreams?"

Key Dream: "I'm having supper at Mary's house (Mary is a warm, tolerant, friendiy woman). Then I discover that I'm pregnant and ready to deliver. in this relaxed atmosphere, I lle down on a cot, and turn into two Identical me's--standing beside myself, I dellver my own chlld, a beautiful Japanese girl."
O.K., I thought: Intultion comes from within and we are our own midwives. What else is new? But then I wondered: does this mean that we actively, to some extent, create Intultion? That it's not just a matter of passively recelving information from "out there?"

Following dreams emphasized the pursult of self-knowledge, understanding past events, and the need to discard past
attitudes that were no longer helpful. Given my dream quest, I concluded that knowing "where one is coming from" has much to do with "where the dream is coming from" and is another aspect of determining when intuition is involved (in Part Two I'll tell the rest of this story).

In the next series of dreams I aggressively changed dream events to fit my Ideals. These dreams were exhiliarating. I woke up knowing: "This is intuition, too." Rather than meekly apprehend coming attractions and passively wait for them to materialize, one could change likely events by changing one's responses and attitudes. Instead of precognating, one could pre-create.

I'd thought that Intuition was different from "belief and feeling dramas," but my dreams seemed to be saying that the line wasn't quite that well-defined.

WEEK THREE: Back to my original quest: "To recelve any guldance and information about the move." I decided that It'd take time to learn how to distingulsh the more probable, 3-D inclpient dream events from the less probable ones, so 1 might as well get more material to practice with. Also, I'd take into account my part in dream-creating (and changing) future events.

Two kinds of dreams emerged. In one kind, I was distressed because we had not known when, where, and how to take care of various things; simple inexpertence would cause problems. The knowledge and skills I needed in order to solve the coming problems could only be galned through having the problems. God couldn't help me It could only sit tight and keep Its fingers crossed.

But my Anna self could. Anna, undeveloped at the expense of reason, was my greatest ally. She would automatically see the situation as a movie, a novel, a board game, an adventure, and a playground for finding out what she was made of and whether her convictions worked or not.

In the second kind of dreams, I was enjoying my new environment. These dreams were colorful, full of plants and friendly people. In one, I'm eating at a big table with others in a fancy place and the man on my right asks me about my Interest in dreams (this one literally "became physlcal" last December).

Dream summary: "Some problems due to inexperlence are just about inevitable. All you can do is your best. In the long run, it'll all come out in the wash, and things will work out well."

WEEK FOUR: My quest: "To develop my Anna self!" At first I thought that I'd deviated seriously from my original goal (I hadn't yet realized the significance of this dream), but following dreams revealed Anna's intimate connection with intuition-precognition.

Key Dream: "Night. I'm in a parking lot; it's drizzling, and I'm very dizzy. can't walk, I keep falling down, and I can't find my car. A young man comes up and
puts his arms around me. This feels wonderful and l like him very much. We walk through the clty, and stop to watch a Ittle girl and her dog. 1 tell the girl in Spanish how cute I think her dog is. We laugh and walk on. I continue to feel very good untll I notice my wedding ring and think, "What would my husband say if he saw me right now? Has this man noticed my wedding ring? If so, what does he think about me, so willingly wrapped up in his arms?" I break away from him and with difficulty manage to find the car. I crawl inside and try to sleep, but the door won't shut, and there are some shadowy flgures lurking nearby, I'm afraid."
in this and following dreams, my Imaginative-intultive self took on different forms, many of them masculine. This part of me wasn't just a little girl and didn't
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_01_0544b681119bd1f1222fg-09.jpg?height=1416&width=635&top_left_y=780&top_left_x=135)
consist exclusively of feminine qualities. It first came into my awareness as a girl child because the process of shutting it out began in childhood. The wedding ring is a good symbol for convention and social rules; it unifies, creates consensus, but also Isolates and restricts.

In another dream my Intultive self was portrayed as a forgotten lover kept In an
old woman's house in a dungeon, while I was a robot from another planet with a string of pearls--was there still time to go to the bank and cash them? Yes: "A beautiful bird flles into my house."

Henry's workbook was a great help. It provided structure and support when I
needed it the most. It also opened a can of worms that are gradually turning Into butterflles. But as 1 hinted at in the beginning, the experiment was only beginning when the 28 days were over....

This dream came to me on 3/15/86 while $I$ was visiting in Rome. The power of the reality in this dream, the intimate physical sensations, were more real to me than waking 'reality.'

The dream starts as I enter a library in which there is a single librarian for each person who enters. The personal care feels very comforting. They are there to help/to explain/to direct.

I approach a woman who is to be my personal helper. We walk upstairs together to a private room. Once in the room I close my eyes and start to fly to the window. I feel as though something is pulling me and that this is a natural and necessary progression of events. I am able to 'see' the window with all its detail with my eyes closed. As I approach the window in flight, I expect to break it, but to my personal surprise 1 penetrate and fly through it. I actually-physically feel the atmospheric increase in pressure against my body as I travel through the glass without harming it. An unexpected wind blows strong on the other side as I flap free and
liberated through space. The sensations are intimate. I have left physical reality, its constraints, for another. While flying, I am also aware and amazed in that I realize that everything on all planes is made up of living energy in different configurations. All realities are one. All 'space' on all dimensions is 'full' of substance.

After a short time I feel that I need to travel back. I know instinctively where the window is and start traveling back through. It feels as though I am being sucked into a vacuum. The wind stops and I feel the constraint of physical reality within the room and within my body. As I am re-entering, I make a very audible gurgling sound which seems to be a form of re-balancing the pressures within my body. I foel the limits of this moment but also am able to trust the limitlessness of all beyond. I feel nourished.

As I return I see the woman standing by a man who is scared and shivering. This is someone I was not aware of before. I realize that this must be a form of my body and she has stayed with it as my spirit traveled. The body 1 re-enter is stronger and closer to the window, so it seems there are three of us.

Upon opening my eyes in the dream body, the woman tells me that she heard me gurgling and was concerned about this shivering carcass. I awake from the dream and realize the unlimited dimensions and realities that exist and the constrants/fears limiting my present life. (Note: this is a direct result of being able to fly through the glass.)

Interpretation: In waking Ilfe I keep active and maintain (too) many platonic relationships with women. When it comes to intimacy, I get scared and numb out. I am presently bored and want that intimacy, but am just watching and waiting. In the dream I see the library as a place of learning where I am able to experience the intimacy of a close relationship with a woman. We go of f alone into a room away from the others.

The dream has two messages at once:
I. The woman's presence grounds me and helps me trust ilfe so that I am able to travel to other emotional and mental dimensions that I am afraid to travel alone. She is there to protect and care for me with her feminine support.
2. I also interpret my flying as fear. The intimacy with her creates a need in me to leave unnoticed through the pane of unbroken glass, through the constraint of the situation, and to fly free by avoiding reality. The gurgling seems to be/feel like the pressure and constraint I go through in Ilving with situations that are intimate. How afraid I aml The scared man needs love-needs to shatter the glass-needs to live that 'expanded' reality in life.

The choice is mine. I am sharing this with you all so that I can make the cholce to live, and to risk and breathe freely, and finally to love. Thank you. I welcome all and any responses.

# DREAM EDUCATORS' <br> NETWORK 

A special-Interest group for teachers In the dream fleld was formed at the 1985 conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams (the ASD) held last June. Calling themselves the Dream Educators' Network, about fifty people volced their concerns and interests as educators. Carol Rupprecht and Stase Michaels agreed to act as coordinators in setting up a newsletter and to sorve as a crossroads for projects helpful to all.

An initial action the group took was a questionnaire which explored backgrounds and opinlons. Highllghts are the following:

Training as a dream educator was obtained by most people by working in a dream group, augmented by considerable work with personal dreams. Lectures and worksnops glven by professionals did a great deal to supplement the experience of many, and to expand dream outlooks. Many current educators cited participation in groups and some supervised experience as a good baselline for becoming an educator.

Lectures, courses, seminars and workshops are taught at colleges, in churches, schools, homes and at conferences. People agree publicity is easler when the course is part of a larger event such as a conference or curriculum of a college. Yet the best publicity was unanimously mentloned as word-of-mouth; personally talking to groups and individuals Is what most enhances interest in getting involved in dreams.

The greatest reward for most people for working as a teacher in the dream fleld lies in satisfaction rather than in dollars. While most educators do recelve fees ranging from $\$ 50$ at a conference for a lecture to a per person fee of $\$ 20-\$ 40$ for weekend seminars or evening classes, many felt financial returns were inadequate for the time and effort Involved. Size of classes ranged from 8-10 people if publicity is carried out privately to 15-50 per class where colleges advertise a course.

Despite low remuneration, educators are much encouraged by the enthuslasm of their students and the Institutions which they work within. Students particularly enjoy sharing dreams, visualizations, drawing a dream or symbol, and narrative or poetry exercises with dreams. Teachers often feel, quoting one who appeared to speak for many, "...llke a collaborator in a wonderful world of discovery." The teacher's own enthusiasm often becomes contaglous, and mentioned by many, may be our most effective teaching ald.

An upcoming highlight for dream educators will be special sessions for educators at the 1986 June ASD conference. Four toples planned are:
--Integration of Dreamwork with Traditional Courses
--Using Themes as a Teaching Tool

Many theorisis regard dreams as either compensatory or adaptlve in nature. Jean Plaget vlewed dreams as being a hybrid incorporating both of these functions. His concept of dream functioning straddles Adierian, Freudian and Junglan theorles. Plaget belleved that dreams were multipurposeful. He designatod six categories to describe their relationship to waking reality (Plaget, 1962). His six categorles were also applicable in the realins of unconscious symbolism and symbolic play.

On the one end of the Plagetlan scale, dreams have the capacity to fulfill wishes. This concept is very similar to the Freudian concept of dream functioning. The wish fulfillment occurs according to Plaget, without secondary symbolism, which Indicates that wish fulfllment occurs through unconscious assimilation. Assimilation is that process in which external reality is incorporated into psychological or blological structures by modification of external elements. The unconscious, assimilative functioning of the dream is manifested in the symbolic representation of daily experience.

Secondly, dreams are seen by Plaget as capable of fulfilling wishes through a process of conscious assimilation as opposed to unconscious assimilation. In this
classification scheme, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between dream object and waking object. The dream symbol is the same object that is being dealt with during waking reality.

In the third category, Plaget vlewed dreams as having compensatory capablities simllar to Jung's percoption of dream functioning. For example, events that are unpleasant to the Individual during waking reality are represented and expressed in dreams as pleasurable experiences.

Nightmares occupy the fourth category. They are considered the counterparts of waking play in which fearful events are deliberately created by the Individual. The function of the nightmare is to simulate, manipulate and experience situations and events that would otherwise have irreversible consequences if created during waking reality.

The fifth category is comprised of dreams that function as punishment for actions contrary to the individual's accepted perception of right and wrong.

Lastly, dreams function as direct translations of organic stimulus from waking reality. One of Plaget's examples is the child's dream of watering a garden which would correspond to a child wetting the bed in reallty.

Since many readers are not involved with a dream group, they might not have the opportunity to discover how others would react to a given dream. In Vol.4, No.5 D.N.B. offered a limited chance to participate in a dream group by inviting readers to submit to the editor ideas and comments on the following dream. Here are the results.

## The Dream

"The setting is the annual meeting of my Church Board in a large coliseum-like building with many entrances. My tunnellike gate is flooded because of high tide. I enter finally, and don't recognize many people. I choose a seat front and center and watch an amazing performance of a Board officer playing with extra large playing cards on a wide grate (apparently suspended in air) until the audience is assembled and ready. He makes a speech designed to arouse enthusiasm at the end of which he introduces a movie with the suggestion that a source of difficulty will be removed at the end of the movie.

I have volunteered to sit in a seat where the spotlight can fall and am aware that the speaker is trying to push a large rubber snakeout from under his shirt and wrap it around me. But I am not aware that the movie includes footage of me being awakened by bright light, looking startled lying on my back, nude, and two unidentlfled women are washing my chest and genitals with soap and water. I am to go through another tunnel to make an entrance after "starring" in this show, but it gets smaller and smaller and at the end 1 feel like it will close in on me from behind and not open up in front--something I try to prevent by lamming my flle of papers into the hinges of the door that would close. I wander through the coliseum, others avoiding me, til I meet Fran at a lunch table in an open dining area. I share with her the hurt that I feel. The President of the Board finally appears, looking thinner, and comes to shake hands. But there is no sense of apology or reconciliation."

We received 15 replies containing some Interpretive suggestions along with enthuslastic comments about how these readers really enjoyed the idea. We also got a letter from a woman who felt this plece was "the last straw" In her total disappointment with DNB because "you came out with a feature that promotes exactly the kind of foolishness l've been trying to educate people against" (Interpreting someone else's dream without input from them).

To set the record straight, we're not trying to derive the "correct" interpretation of this dream and are unfamiliar with the dreamer's life circumstances at the time of this dream. The dream was selected from a flle because of Its rich Imagery which we thought would lead to many different possible speculations (and it did). We're reminded of the example from the Talmud where a man took a dream to 24 different dream interpreters in the marketplace at Jerusalem and recelved 24 different Interpretations, but they all had some feature that was subsequently verifled in the dreamer's life. Dreams have many levels of meaning and the most powerful symbols are those that can connect with many strata of significance simultaneously.

The purpose of this exercise is to sensitize readers to the obvious fact that the same dream can be initlally reacted to in very different ways and that certain objects and actions will be selected out for attention by some interpreters and Ignored by others. Without the dreamor's associations and amplifications, without knowledge of the dreamer's past and current personal history, without famillarity with his previous or subsequent dreams, we cannot accurately extract the important message that was intended for the dreamer. However, by examining a few selected commentaries, you can hopefully develop
some flexibllity in your own approach to dreams anu expand your creative horizons In considering what dreams might be saying.

Let's begin by looking at the titles that wore suggested for this dream by readers.
I. Many Ways To Enlightenment (Claudia Carton, MS)
2. Light At the End of the Tunnel (Jeffrey and Susan Goldstein, NJ)
3. A Blrth Trauma (Gary Rogers, TX)
4. Born Agaln (Nancy Campbell, CA)
5. Arena of Rebirth (Jlm Klein, NC)
6. Starring in the Collseum of Life (Don Haselwood, FL)
7. A "Star" Stands Out But Risks Fall Out (Rita Dwyer, VA)
8. Examining a Risky Deal (Ruth Mendell, OH)
9. A Warning Dream (Carolyn Amundson, DC)
10. Trying To Over-Compensate Leads To Belng All F** *ed Up (Charlotte Bell, NH)
II. President of the Board (Judith Plcone, WA)
12. Afraid To Move Forward (Reader's Name Lost)
13. Why Continue To Struggle? (LInda Ravenwolf, CA)
14. Unauthorized Exposure (Bob Krumhansl, MD)

To amplify a few of the titles, here are some excerpts from the analyses offered by readers.
(^ Birth Trauma) "Tho tunnel-like gate would represent the cervix, the spotlight might be bright hospital lights in the delivery room, and the large rubber snake might be an umbilical cord or delivery paraphernalla."
(Why Continue To Struggle?) "An organization which is supposed to be superior and important is submitting me to judgment and indignity. It is difficult to approach this organization, my emotions interfere, but when I do get close, I see
the main representative is playing a he that is out of touch with reality. He also tries to force enthusiasm - false energy like a rubber snake."
(Light At the End of the Tunnel) "The rubber snake threat may mean the dreamer sees through any possible intimidation from internal and external authority; the 'snake' image may as well point to the molting aspect of transformation, the dreamer saves himself by his 'file of papers' hinting that his professional laurels are a way out of the compression present in his current situation."
(Unauthorized Exposure) "The tunnel leading to a grand 'entrance' turns out to be some kind of trap which is only escaped by backing up and using some 'organized' and stored paper records to survive (accumulated evidence from the past).... How about a 'tempting' snake which represented evil forces back in the Garden of Eden?"
(Examining a Risky Deal) The dreamer is honest and fair in business but doesn't know many others with these qualities in his work field. He centers himself and
watches a play back of a blg business deal he's involved in and is surprised to find he's gambled on something risky and is in danger of losing money and reputation ... Its foods trappod nod foncful of $n$ doal which may appear shady and realizes that his only hope is to fille a law suit."
(Afraid to Move Forward) "The dreamer is facing an internal battle with his rellgious beliefs (possible pun:church bored?). He enters the conflict by way of a flooded tunnel, possibly indicating that the issue has been forced into the open by a flood of emotions which the dreamer feels unable to contain ... he has had a revelation (awakened by bright light). This event lald bare all of his hidden, private beliefs for the purpose of spiritual cleansIng ... The dreamer must choose to elther follow his own vision into the unknown, or go back to the famillar comfort and Ilmitations of the church."
(A Warning Dream) "The dreamer is being asked by his splittual self to take a good look at his emotional/sexual life, which may result in his feelling exposed and humiliated. He is gambiling and may deprive himself of both a meaningful past and a meaningful future."

Fred Olsen gave this dream as an assignment for his dream class at California State University at Hayward and sent two composite interpretations from his classes.

Here Is a silghtly edited version of one of them:
"The dreamer could be on a spiritual journey as suggested by the Church Board meeting and by the tunnels. The many entrances to the buliding might mean that there are many possibilities for him to choose from. The choice is difflcult because he is overwhelmed by material from the unconsclous (his gate is flooded) or he is feeling trapped or in a restrictive place. He seems to be in danger Internally due to an elevated opinlon of himself (choosing a center seat in the spotlight, suspension in air) and during the movie he is vulnerable (flat on his back, under a bright light and nude). This sequence with the women seems to suggest the possibility for healing from the feminine as they are washing him and water is healing.

But there seems to be danger in that he is "not aware" or passive as he watches a movie in which he is the central flgure but he's unconscious about his part in the movie.

The difficulty that is to be removed at the end of the movie might be a resolution of his mid-IIfe transition (as postulated by his age) or an involvement with and acceptance of his feminine side. Things are bad but certainly not impossible. The end suggests the need for forglveness and reconclilation."

# Combining Dreams and Poetry to Find Personal Power 

Writing poems and working with dreams both seem like subversive activitles to me. That is, according to our larger world, and not within the dream community or the circle of poets that read and support each other. My Interest in my dreams goes back to my chlldhood where they were never talked about. They were as taboo as sex was, but less understood. The nightmares I had as a child weren't discussed or made use of. Poetry, llke dreams, in our soclety is only used marginally. Poems focus on feelings, moments condensed into poetlc verse, they are dark, shadowy, lllusive as our dreams and as fleeting. Metaphors encapsulate a mllky-way of Images. Poems and dreams are how we read the world, our condensation of life Into Images from our personal experlence. From our own mirror of the world we can claim our power to connect with all humanity.

In my dreams I experlence my fears through haunting Images of powerlessness. I am the outsider watching, unable to make changes that would heal the situation. Outside looking at the pain, I become one with it. I watch a famlly locked in a car, they sink into a puddle that rises into an ocean. Little black boys cry out to me for help but 1 cannot reach them. Deformed hands beg for money I do not have. I am watching the world bleed until I turn into a spider that shrinks away to nothing, fearful I will be stepped on. My dreams often show me powerless in a world that places Its emphasis and money into milltary bulldup instead of Into enrichment of human life. My dreams are common to many who also dream of nuclear destruction, crime and victimization.

I write poetry as a passion to share my visions and my fears, and to confirm that we all share a collective unconsclous. Often I dream of events that are in the news soon after. When I use my dreams for my poetry I am unlocking their power. I am taking the images from my dreams, my symbols from my experience in this world and glving them life. I am channeling the power that lays dormant in the dream. From our dreams we can begin to reclaim our shared Inheritance; we are all more
> "WHEN I USE MY DREAMS FOR MY POETRY, I AM UNLOCKING THEIR POWER"
than the families we are born into. Dreams and poems combined connect us in a way that depersonalizes through shared fears, perceptions and experiences. I belleve we are all a part of everyone else. I am the little black boy in Atlanta, I feel the pain of all humankind. Giving dreams life through poetry releases energy back to the collective universe that helped shape them. My poem-dreams remind mo of the war we have on this planet and the Implications on the quallty of life. As my cream Images intertwine into poems moving from the personal back to the larger collective, they become mentors in my own life and in the lives of others.

I am reminded to be more forgiving, more aware of other people's problems. If I am angry, it is easier to understand the person near enough to blame, is probably
not the cause despite appearances. I am reminded love between people is essential for healthy coexistence; 1 am not as different from my neighbor as the same. The deepest part of our belng is to our connections desplte race, creed or sex. My poems are my way of reaching out and sharing my visions. My poems and dreams are tools for communication and growth between the commonalities and the differences we all share.

As soon as I sat down and wrote the poem "The World As We Know It," the awful fear caused by the dream released. Putting the despair of my survival on paper, I was utilizing the energy of the dream in a powerful way. 1 turned my fear Inside out. The dream and the poem become one with life, someone else can read it and identify with it.

# The Start of a Long Walk Home

Although I have been interested in dreaming for a long time and have kept a record of dreams for ten years, I have only recently turned my focused attention to this aspect of my life, in an attempt to gain some control over my dreams. What follows is an account of the first week of my exploration, the beginning of my personal dream research.

Up untll now, my interest has been mainly watching how my Imagination works when my subconsclous is less hampered by the restraints of the waking state, as a way of helping me in my work as a fiction writer and in my personal growth. But now I have shifted my attention from what my dreams present to me in terms of material, to how I can Interact and even control that material. I felt I had the skills of gatherIng and "reading" my dreams, but I hardly knew where to begin in terms of control or Incubation, and I could only hope that I would learn as I went along.

The first night of my dream exploration, I prepared by reading the Dream Network Bulletin Just before sleep, hoping to imprint an awareness of dreaming in general. Then with the lights out, I tried to incubate a particular scene, of me in a room full of my favorite writers, who were encouraging me. I hoped that by trying to

Induce such an appealing dream, I would have more chance of attaining it. 1 also tried to increase my chances of lucidity, by concentrating on a particular ring I would wear in the dream, which would trigger an awareness of the dreamstate, hopefully without waking me. I found that concentrating on these images made me tense and irritable. Only when I let up did I fall asloop.

In the morning I had my dreams, but not the ones I wanted. Of note, though, was the awareness of a blank space between two dreams, that I incorporated Into the second dream. The Image was of waking up from a strange state of consclousness and finding myself in a plain, institutional room with a young doctor who was there to care for me as I made the transition back to a normal state. It was as though I had been In a trance for weeks, the blankness of which I could almost physically remember, but I felt safe under his care. Awake, I wondered if he might be a dream guide who might come to me again. The blankness reminded me of dreams I had had of being dead, though some say such a dream is not possible.

For several nights I continued trying to incubate the same dream of the room full of writers and my ring, with less forced attention, returning to the Image like a mantra when I found myself drifting away. But not only didn't I produce the desired Images, I began to fllter my dream memorles, as though If the content of the dream did not seem sufficiently "interestIng" or Inventive, I would then discard it before returning to sleep or the next dream. I was developing a sort of snobbish, self-critical attitude about my dreams,
"My dreams go on about their business with or without me, and I must earn entry... by patient attention ..."
and that was cutting me off from two of three dreams a night, though I could sense them vaguely just beyond my memory's reach. I recalled pleasant or humorous dreams, like discovering $l$ could skate well enough to play ice hockey, or finding a plcture of an old frlend as a child standing on a chandeller, studying a huge gllded-framed painting, but any dream with an ordinary setting, I let sllp by.

I think this demonstrated a preoccupation with content over experience that could come from my belng a writer, where It is necessary to dismiss images that are not absolutely vital to a story. So tho next night I abandoned the forced incubation, hoping to break the habit of filtering, and belleving that by focusing on a certain Image I was further justifying the dismissal of onos that didn't match It. I felt I had to start agaln at square one. After all, the basis of my dream work was that all dreams are valuable and that my experiencing of the elements in the dream would be more a key to control of them than the elements themselves. It was discouraging to think that by "trying too hard" I was allenating myself from my dreams, and it seemed that I needed to develop a lighter touch in dealing with them. This was not a new lesson: I have in the past "blown" a number of lucid dreams by gettling so excited at some proof of lucidity that the dream dissolved into wakefulness.

Without trying to incubate, I did seem to remember more dreams, and was able to recall dreams that were more an embodlment of an emotion than a set of physical detalls. One had to do with uncomfortab sociallzing at a wedding, and in the drea without specific detail of place or person, did sense an unpleasant time turning into a pleasant one, in part because of me, my first hint of control in a dream, with just a whisper of awareness.

So by the end of my first week of dream attention, I had learned, or re-learned, an important lesson: My mind is not easily turned in a certain direction; my dreams must be handled gently and generously, not pushed. When I make demands on my dream imagination, it shuts its door. When I expect all my dreams to be colorful, active and brilliant, I risk letting my vanity stand between me and some valuable, solld, down to earth dreams. My dreams go on about their business with or without me, and I must earn entry to their secrets, by patient attention over a perlod of time, before I can expect to be more than a "sllent partner."

And then I had a dream that was, in some way, a reward for my week's work, and made me feel I was on the right track. It was night, but a night full of llight and warmth, and I was on top of the tallest hill in the area, with a long walk home before me. It would probably take all night, I reasoned, looking over the vast networks of hills, roads and neighborhoods to cover, but I was in no hurry, and the walking Itself would feel wonderful.

## A Nightmare Walking the Mountain Mists

Beelzebub ${ }^{*}$ knows the footing here. Mountalns infested with a coid smoke leer over the town set thorning in rain.

Fields to the east clot with birds. The pond thickens, a throat with phiegm. A motel user walks his dog, catches
the steam from Its' piss and flinches at the intimation of death and God. Beelzebub has found a witness.

Figures autograph the mist, the dog growls without direction. Diesels groaning up the highway
condense water on their hoods. The cemetery has opened. The escaped lizards, the phantoms
roam the countryside, the wind In their stomachs. Horses afert, thin spasm after spasm.

A hitchhiker gambles on the road. The bloodsmell runs from his lungs, stings the hunger, the unclean need
bats swarm to this like Piranha. The hitchhiker turning from the road sets up the scene for appetite
and dream to nightmare by the stream that feeds the pond the Loons plead on nightly til morning. Fire decreases,
the world burns out. Water is a language of frogs, ditches. His eyes catch, snakes have their victims, everything feeds on transposition.

The dog walls with a snapped spline a tire breaks when driver and alcohol speed on. The motel walker screams,
sends the woodsleeper an erle dream of burning, nerves lost in the blood. He awakens, panic syringed into his velns.

of grass, he runs, a wild bull
hit by shrapnel into the thickness before the bottom. Mud flumes up, The dog's wall drowns his screaming, the half-formed and lizards
group in clumps by the shore. He blooms there, gets his footing. The fire burns completely out.

## The Gift of Lucidity

Demand a gift from a dream character? That Idea, attributed to the Senol, has never appealed to me. Whenever I get pushy with dream characters, they respond in kind. I don't blame them. Yet, dream figures have spontaneously presented me with both a gold necklace and a golden music stand.

Befrlending the dream seems to be the key. Other dreamers report the benefits of thls approach. By valuing the lucid state, members of the Lucidity Project have gifted themselves with some especially preclous dreams:
"I am lucid and flying near a city vlewing it from the harbor. It is partly a live city with tall brown skyscrapers; partly huge cracker boxes painted with designs and graphics, like Maurice Sendak's in the Night Kitchen. I say to myself as I fly past the changing scenery, 'This dream is a gift, I'm fortunate to be experiencing something so beautiful and so much fun."

Later, the same dreamer related this dream: "I was in a large room when I became lucid. I started to fly out when I noticed that the room was very beautiful, so I changed my mind and explored the room Instead. First the ceiling caught my eye. It was made of shimmering silvery panels. The room was filled with flowers of many kinds and colors. I had the feeling of being on the inside of a beautifully wrapped Christmas gift, looking out."

Being awake and aware of the beauty of the inner self--now, that's a dream to treasurel Dreams can be a rich source of creative inspiration. Unfortunately, much can be lost in the process of awakening. Lucidity helped Elaine bring her gift of creativity to the waking state:
"I see three small posters on the wall. The two top ones say "Mourning" as a title and the bottom one says "Moaning." I am reading the center one and as I begin to wake, I manage to memorize the lines:
'Let everything move with measured step and slow.

Let the waters run over the rocks in quiet contemplation.

Let the sea have dark and Impenetrable depths.

Let the skies roar in anger with thunder and lightning.""

Here's a practical present: a head-start with dream interpretation, when Robert asked a dream character what an
unusual symbol meant and got an answer!
"I am In Minneapolls on a sunny, mild winter's day. There is a foot of snow on the ground. I am standing near the top step of a porch--on the porch are about four people. Covering the porch steps are hundreds of amber and emerald colored gems and crystals. Suddenly, I reallze I'm dreaming. Instaad of flying around, I look around nond soo my good friend, Andrea, at the bottom of steps. I think, ' 1his is my chance'--so I bend down and pick up an amber gem, which I hold between my thumb and forefinger. I look down at Andrea, and loudly call her. 'Andrea, what does this represent?' Andrea looks up at the gem and me, and quietly but firmly states, 'Hope and Consclousness"'

What insight do lucid dreamers gain? One dreamer reported: "My wife and I are sitting across a table from each other engaged in discussion. I look down between my hands on the table and into a mirror. There are three standing floures in the mirror. It appears in my mind that
these three figures, all dressed in white, are my spirit guides.

I hey reach out a hand, each one of the three, and bring forth a light into one merged beam--which leaves the mirror and strikes me directly in the forehead. I become lucid momentarlly as I feel my head recoll from the Impact. As I awake, I reallze the light beam contained a message to me: "Psychic Power."

He continues: "Whether the light beam Is a symbolic gift, or an awakening of my own abilities, or both, I don't know. I appreclate only the gift, regardless of the source, but the mirror makes me think it comes from within me...incidentally, my wife dreamed that night of our meeting at the same location."

Mutual dreams, creative and problem solving dreams, sexual and flying dreams, dreams of reading and revelation, roleplaying and rehearsal, refreshment and rejuvenation, reconclilation and resolution.. yes, even precognitive dreams can be gifts of the lucid state.

## EARTHQUAKE IMAGERY IN DREAMS

1 would like to encourage contributors to include dates with their dream records and the first verbatim notations on how tho dream material was worked. I strongly belleve an influx of uncut, unadorned contributions from our dreamers, (as well as from our experts,) is the key not only to Increased subscribership, but also the key to a sudden new enlightening turn in the course of dream work as a whole.
"Right brain, left brain" articles lend me to belleve dreams are one of the ways the visual, feeling, "right brain" makes itself heard in the world, as people on all levels work cheerfully and persistently toward becoming "whole minded" persons.

I heartly recommend INTERNATIORINL BRAIN DOMINANCE REVIEW, 105 Laurel Drive, Lake Lure, NC 28746, as an example of the totally delightful synergy that results when theory and technology put their heads together.

Here are 2 dreams of mine and how 1 worked on them.

## Mt. Rushmore, 4 Faces

(10-1-85 Last dream of the sleep perlod)
Movable props on tracks simulate a city during an earthquake with walls moving around. The surrounding scene is tall mountains ringing the valley with sunshine on the peaks and the 4 Mt . Rushmore faces like bright gold in the middle.

## A Noteworthy Event

(11-4-85 waking up dream)
In a western town, at a place like a laundry. Woman brings a large baby and sets him in a tub to soak. Chlld is large, falr, appears sunburned or has a skin condition. Woman leaves. Placid child plays happlly in the tub, back to me. Large girl, (sister?) comes In later and watches the child in the tub. I suddenly notice the child is singing classical music perfectly (in baby sounds). I have to smille. The child is probably a genlus in the hands of a woman who glves him all the space and time he needs to develop.

The town is astir with political factions. I have to leave to go to the sheriff's office to meet a group going to the funeral of an important person. I run
back to the laundry place to check on the child, but the girl is taking him home OK. She is trying to make him jump up a curb or boardwalk step much too high for his short legs. I protest, but another person says he is able to do it. It dawns on me he is able to levitate (or fly). I lift 3-4 fect off the ground, and ask, Like this? The person talking to me asks: "What kind of person can learn to do that?" I answer, "I have never tried to teach it to anyone who was unable to do it, but that doesn't mean everyone can."

We start to go to the funcral when suddenly an earthquake strikes. A woman like my mother-in-law gets her leg stuck in a crack in the ground, but pulls it out without even tearing her pantyhose. We continue ty going through the woman's house to go down the hill. Everything shakes. When we get down to her back patio, a cold wind has come up. She gives her coats in the back closet to the ladies who cane without them. She gives a short jacket to a small girl who is frozen in a sitting position out of fright. I put the jacket around her and carry her. She is very tiny and scared.

We get to the burial ground. They manage to get the electric lights back on in the Mission style church buildings.

A black knight with 2 cattle dogs for horses is under a swaying booth getting ready to be an Indian mounted honor guard. I am glad when he proceeds safely from under the swaying ritual rooftop.

Other Indians follow him behind the Mission type bullding toward the burial ground in back. The land is stark and western looking. The sky is gray and threatening. The funeral proceeds as scheduled in spite of the apparent continuIng earthquake.

Note: This western scene is like a composte stage setting reminiscent of the earlier carthquake dream with the movable props and the P.At. Rushinore presidential heads spotlighted in the background.

Translation: The day of President Reagan's funeral, an earthquake shakes the heartland of America.

## A SPIRITUAL DREAM

Your "sauna" editorlal worked and inspired me to write In a diemand romew my subscription for the following year to DNB. I have been on an Immense spiritual Journey which started with the onset of the following dream. I have always believed that the spirit speaks through my dreams. Life is going along so well right now and giving me such limitless gifts that it is a little frightening and totally consuming. Here is the dream:

My cousins Ron and Joan (who are about fifteen and sixteen in the dream) are coming out of a huge barn and their dead father is talking to them from the spirit world. Henry's voice is sweet and calm, as It was when he was allve 24 years ago. There is a beautiful simple church with a sparkling white steeple directly in back of the barn. The alr is crisp and the sun is shining brilliantly. I then go into a roor with a big famlly dinner and fall into my sister's arms and cry out of Joy for hearing my uncle's volce after so long.

Interpretation: The barn symbollzes my deceased Uncle Henry's life style - he was a wonderful gardener, farmer and guidance counselor. The church represents my strong and growlng faith In God and the power of my dreams in connoction with the Holy Spirlt. (I told this dream co my father who is the brother of Uncle Henry and he stopped in his tracks. He sald that the morning I had the dream was Henry's birthday. I had no recollection of that.) The barn and church also symbollze (respectively), earthbound forces and grounding and the spirit world and inner growth. My graduate studies involve social work and 1 belleve my uncle represents the "guldance and down-to-earth" qualities I need to keep focused on, to get through my rigorous studies.

I would like to unite group psychotherapy with spiritual healing somehow. I have lllustrated this dream and have merged the steeple into the roof of the barn to demonstrate that union.

If anyone has books they would like to recommend about the union of social work and theology I would be very appreciative.

## WEATHER DREANS

Let me begin by saying that i enjoy the bulletin's new format. I have a particular interest in seelng more dream poetry, drawings and dream Interpretation In the form of individuals exchanging their personal ideas of other dreams, such as you describe In Vol.4, \#5. Thank you for the spark of inspiration returned.

The following words that I am sending to you is a consclous daydream to dream Incantation that I purposely contrived with the hopes of alding my nocturnal dream state. I tried working consclously contrived words, such as these Into a sing-song Incantation form with the hopes that It would act as a 'caller' Into my subconsclous, and also to the "earthly spiritual", or the spiritual essence of certain earth elements. Its ultimate intention was for specific healing purposes for the heart. My hope, or expectation, was for a specific nocturnal dream to form a kind of symbolic answer or 'call back.' It was Interesting to note the next morning on the 'kind of' dream I had.

The dream was more a recall of movement, as if swimming in dark and deep. water. There were no particular Images. The dream held more of a sense, or knowing without seeing. I felt empowered upon awaking, as If I communed with the elemental force's spiritual entity; an entity most of us do not recognize as reality.
i also have another interesting dream experlence to share concerning non-objectlonable earth element forces. I dreamed that I was at this rowdy square dance caught up in the high tervor of the flddiling music. The music becomes so spirited, that It strips me of all inhibition and l jump up to dance jubilantly. Suddenly I start spinning, and 1 begin to spin faster and faster. I extend my arms outward, and this incredibly spiralling force over takes me. I awoke abruptly. 7 hat morning I hear the weatherman announce the development of 'hurrlcane Glorla's eye.' A strange feelling washed over me, as If I went momentarlly within the eye, or else felt the Initial winds...

I am interested in hearing from any others who may have experlenced similar dream 'sensations' that coincidentally fell within certain weather patterns, phenomenon, or other earth elemental changes. Also, others are welcomed to experiment with my own particular 'daydream to dream' Incantation, or visuallzation poem, and I would be Interested in hearing of any results. On a regional basis, I am Interested in exchanging Information experiments, etc. from parents that work with their children's dream recordings in the northern West Virginla area.

## Incantation

(Copyright 1986 clm 'color Incantations')
I shall dream that I am blue
I shall dream that I am blue upon the ocean shore
I dream that out among the alr over the sea I hover
I shall dream that I fly even and low along the line that sea and sky share that
seem where I am to belong
I whisper there
A hushed song
I hover low and calm
I learn from the sea as the sky breathes for me
I dream the sea moving
A deep universal roll, a turn Into Infinity I shall dream that I drift onto the very point
where the storm is born to travel east, and so
where the western storm falls to rest as the vortex
It is there that I hear the mermalds sing tale-fllled songs of the depths down under
Songs with hexed laughter of those that come after
Such dreams...
I dreamed that I learned
and carried for protection those gifts Gifts that can only be given, not taken, and so
I am given the dream of continuance
That continuance is the return
And I am washed allve, as that moving
searn soals behind me,
And for me the enclrcled symbol
(Jay Lee, 31-A Monongahela Ave. Morgantown, WV 26505)

## VIEWPOINT ON LUCIDITY

I'm writing because you may find my v lew point, though of a minority, pertinent. I have been a successful lucid dreamer since the late 60's. Though 40 now and down to I per year, each dream Is as vivid as last night. If dreams are of therapeutic use, and I'm sure they can be, the relative change potential in my vlew is over shadowed by efforts made to understand how we function dynamicallyl

To me, dreams are to be explolted into lucidity. The dynamic element of dreams is the conflict experlenced. The correct universal behavior that results in lucidity is giving into the object of the confllit in gesture of "Facing the music," of opening your dream arms toward whatever is threatening.

The only reason we are not all lucid In dreams is that we are not lucid during waking llfe.

My sole Interest is in understanding "lucidity," not the dreams It produces or doesn't produce. Articles such as those which appear in DNB are helpful for those who relate to dreams as some forum for the self in some external "dream world." To my way of thinking, the dream is
something to be manipulated, a vehicle you drive to lucidity. So, it is difflcult for mo to understand why you are not spending more time with articles on brain studies such as the 3 triune brain, the RAF, rathort Binet's mind model in "Supreme Doctrine" and "Let go," Tibetlan Dream Yoga, floatation, Ollver Fox, Ophiel, or J.H. Whitman's the "Mystical Lifs" that attempts to categorize lucid experlences beyond the dream world. Best of Dreams.
(Bill Rowe, 3836 Medowiark Lane, Cincinnati, OH 45227)

## A DREAM OF THE SHUTTLE DISASTER?

I had this "dream" Juesday morning (Jan. 28, 1986):

I see faces of people from my past...and the whole...living person...of various television news people, and local newspaper people I know, friends I have not seen for a while. They all gather at one end of a huge room. I sense a magical circle in the center of the room. A cylindrical tower of alr seems to be coming up through it. My mother is there. I see a beautiful short length KImono robe, and a lovely silk or satin scarf...and a small rectangular box that has a bottle of perfume or jewelry In It...are all floating around. I am most fascinated by the slik scarf and kimono. I grab the klmono and let it go again marveling at how it floats and looks almost like an invisible person is wearing it. I take it and give it to mom and tell her to psychometrize the.as I sense a strange energy around. When she puts it on she holds her arms strangely and seems to be distressed, even slckened. I clutch the scarf with apprehension...as she tells me to bless it...with a magical circle ritual. I begin to do the salutes to the 4 directIons...but I accidentally start in the south and do it's fire element saiute twice...then go on to the west and north. Then I realize I forgot the eastern salute with the element of air. I think I should do it now... then Bangl there is a huge explosionl I am blown down flat on my back, then I bounce up into a sitting position...legs straight out in front of me. I feel a burning stinging sensation all over my body.

Once awake...a little more than an hour later the shuttle story broke across the TV screen.

I did not know the number of astronauts, nor their ethnic origins nor genders except for the school teacher. I had not seen nor read much of anything on the subject. I had never seen a photograph of any other members other than the 2 women and one of the men.

But I had a "day-dream" of an elderly orlental lady in an ankle length gray kimono putting white candles and flowers around a statue of the Buddha...she puts a large black plllow and an incense burner in front of it. I feel she is in mourning.

1 figured there must have been an orlental person on board the shuttle. An hour or more later I discovered I was right.

Whin I found out it was a Japanese Amotican man, on his second shuttle ride, and that there were 2 women on this trip...l thought perhaps the klmono and scarf and perfume (or whatever) were gifts he brought aboard for the two women.

I wonder If I have precognitive dreams...I could sent tape cassettes of them. Writing gets to be a drag sometimes. I had one about President Reagan-truly fantastic. I'd like to share. I also had extraordinarlly accurate dreams about the deaths of Natale Wood and John Lennon....months before they actually happened.
(Merry Loona, The Moontlower Box, P.O.Box 452, Davenport, IA 52805)

## LUCID POEM

The following poem was written in my Advanced Dream Studies Class taught by Dr. Robert Van de Castle. In class that night, we worked with an exercise from Henry Reed's book, Getting Help from Your Dreams. We each picked one of our dreams and chose the flue most powerful words from it. We used these words as the basis for writing five sentences for each word chosen. Then we used one or two sentences derived from each word group to write a poem working with those phrases.

My poem is meant to be a comment on Lucid Dreaming as my dream was.

Lucidity is a control one holds loosely, too much and you lose fluidity, too little and you become a leaf in the current; manipulation of this state is the key, great forces carry me, and yet I steer. Lucidity is the fine balance to seek; control is the yes and the no, one does, and does not do it.
(Rob Davis, Charlottesville, VA)

## DREANS OF THE DEAD

Dr. Marle-Louise von Franz and I are at present working on a research project for the purpose of investigating dreams in which figures of the dead appear. This project will also furnish data for my diploma theses, at the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, titled "The Alchemical Transformation in Death"--an analysis of dreams concerning post-mortal existence. Dr. von Franz is acting as supervisor for this thesis.

The most important question which the research and the thesis will attempt to answer 1s:

What does the unconscious have to say about death and about life after death
(a) through dreams which occur shortly before the death of the dreamer; and, more especially,
(b) through droums which occur after the death of an Individual, in which the departed appears to surviving family members and friends?

Uur principal difficulty, of course, will be the evaluation of the objective and subjective levels of such dreams, and, in category (b), of the flgures of the deceased; In other words, whether the dream flgure represents a subjective factor-an aspect, a "complex"--of the dreamer, or whether the dream is making a statement about the dead person himself, thus giving us "objective" information about his or her after-death existence. We hope, however, to be able to distingulsh between the two levels and to work on those dreams, or parts of dreams, which, when interpreted on the objective level, will contribute to our theme.

It is not very easy to find dreams of this nature. Both Dr. von Franz and I would therefore be most grateful If you would be willing to share any such dreams you may have had with us. All such material would, of course, be treated with the utmost discretion.

If you are prepared to help us make this project as meaningful as possible, please send (air mail) your dream material to me at the address below:

# Henry Reed's DREAM JOURNAL 

The Shoes of a Dreamer

I'm going through the tedious, but fascinating process of transferring all my dream journals onto computer disks so that I can more conveniently study my dream symbology. In dolng so, I was struck by the number of times my dreams contain reference to shoes. Here's one of the dreams that caught my attention by its simplicity:

## I'm pollshing my shoes.

This dream occurred on the eve of a new semester of teaching. It clearly reflects a preparation process, getting ready, getting my act cleaned up, trying to look good. I rarely pollsh my shoes except for special occasions. The start of a semester was a special occasion. There are many special occasions for which I do not polish my shoes--rubbing them against the back of my pants as I head out the door is often sufficient. For me, polished shoes are a minor detail--say, compared to having my shirt ironed--but one I have learned that may subliminally affect other people's perceptions of me. If the occasion calls for Impeccability, then perhaps the shoes should be shined--a perfectionistic ritual.

I can think of another occasion that called for perfectionism--ROTC inspection For that I would have to also polish my brass buttons and brass belt buckle, not to mention my shoes shined with spit. ROTC is a long distant memory. It makes me realize, however, that on many occasions since that time, I'll shine any jewelry that I may wear, especially sliver or copper, because of its corrosibility, but I still won't shine my shoes, just dust them off a bit. What does it mean then to shine my SHOES?

What are shoes? They provide confort and support for my feet. What are my feet? They are what I walk with, what I use to contact the ground. Depending upon the type of ground I am going to walk on and the way in which I want to walk on that ground, I choose an appropriate pair of shoes. I have many to choose fromsneakers, moccasins, sandals, slip-ons, lace-ups and boots; and they may be casual, formal or just plain comfy. shoes seem to be an interface between feet and ground that can take into account my intentions and desires and the conditions l'll encounter.

I can pick a pair of shoes that will match the occasion, and that feels good. I've also known the pleasure, like David Letterman, of being dressed up except for my sneakers--it does provide a bit of rebellious pleasure as well as compensatory rellef from the constrictions of a closed collar and tie. On the other hand, in my dreams l've found myself in a situation with inadequate shoes, like walking in snow while wearing sandals, a trying experiencel

Having the right pair of shoes on makes you feel Just right, and having the wrong pair on can ruln your pleasure and make you feel "off." So what are shoes?

Somehow, metaphors and flgures of speech Involving shoes may provide a clue to the meaning of shoes. "If the shoe fits, wear it." Why not say, "If the shirt fits, wear It"? We say that a person who is financially well off is "well heeled," meaning the person can absorb a lot of scrapes and scuffing without the wear showing. "Walk a mile in the other person's moccasins." "If you were in my shoes..." "Nothing fits like an old palr of shoes." Do you know of others?
l'd like to suggest an experiment. I would like to Invite readers to submit their dreams that contain images of shoes, different types of shoes, being without shoes when that is an Issue in the dream. I would also like you to submit as many flgures of speech that Involve footwear as you can think of or find other cultural expressions involving shoes. Write me a few lines about what you think shoes mean.

I'll collate the material you send In, add all my own shoe dreams, and see what I can come up with. Wit Bob's help, perhaps we can do some content analysis d the dreams with shoe Imagery and see if they differ from dreams with imagery of other types of apparel. What other kinds of analyses might you suggest? If you respond soon enough, I can publish the results in the issue after next. If this collaborative process seems to work, then after shoes, we can go on to shirts and skirts, and then to automoblles. I suspect that tires may relate to shoes.
