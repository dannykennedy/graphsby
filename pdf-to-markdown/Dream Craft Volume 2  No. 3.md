## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

## Dear Friends,

I've been working with .a wonderful book about writing called WRITING THE NATURAL WAY by Gabriele Rico and was struck by this quote by Sam Keen, "To wonder is to live in the world of novelty rather than law (or habit), of delight rather than obligation, and of the present rather than the future." Our dreams seem to bring that wonder to us. Not just, "I WONDER what that means"!?, but the wonder of exploring different planets, flying, being President, chased by monsters or saving someone's life, All the fears and joys of letting go of our waking sense of the limitations of time and space. I believe one waking state limitation is to believe that someone else has the answers to your dreams. I'm not saying it isn't helpful to read what someone else has to say or to get the point of view of others, but the greatest discovery we will probably make is that we really are the only one who knows what our dreams mean.

It's been my experience that when I seek an answer, I find it wherever I decide to look or I create an experience that gives me the answer that I seek. For example, I went through a period of time where I would form a question about something that was bothering me and intuitively choose a book, open it and read what was before me. I'd say that at least $90 \%$ of the time I had my answer. I've taken classes on intuition and through my experiences with group dreaming I now have more confidence in my own intuition and find I don't need to give myself this type of "reading" anymore (I still enjoy drawing Rune stones though!).

I think the same approach can be applied to dreaming. Dreams are a part of us, our unique creation. Like stories or paintings, I think others may discover their own meaning when they hear or read our dreams, or even feel they have some insight into what they mean for us and it is possible that they do. After all, our choosing to tell that person can be an intuitive decision--our way of "giving ourself a reading." Books and articles can be very helpful in giving us. techniques and information. I really enjoy that feeling of synchronicity--of just "happening" to get that letter, newsletter or book working with the same question I am. I think if you consciously make the choice to seek an answer you will receive it; it helps to make the question as clear to yourself as (Continued on Page 2 )

DREAMS AND HEALING

Strephon Kap1an Wi11iams
Certainly dreams have been used in healing in many cultures. Apparently the ancient Aesculapian healing mysteries which lasted a thousand years in Greece based their healing practices on receiving a dream in which the god appeared with the remedy. More recently certain schools of psychotherapy such as the Gesta1t and Jungian schools may use dreams for healing.

In my own work developing a modified Jungian approach as represented in my JUNGIAN-SENOI DREAMWORK MANUAL the emphasis in on breakthrough healing. This is healing which really works, affecting major changes in personality and life. The traditional schools of psychotherapy base their dreamwork method more upon intellectual, interpretive approaches, which to my way of thinking is a strange mixture of projection and objectification on the part of both the therapist and client. It is at times simply amazing to me that anyone else even attempts to tell someone what his or her dream means. What is the alternative which can lead to healing?

The method of actualization which I use is to emphasize ways of working with and (Continued on Page 2)

you can. Finding the answer then will confirm to you your own inner strengths and the wisdom of your own inner voice--even if this answer comes from someone else! Try practicing this with your dreams. Seek understanding through your dream group, books, dream dialogues or whatever. Then be still a moment, Iisten and learn to recognize the loving voice within you that tells you what is right for you.

To me this is the essence of networking--to be a part of the connectedness that brings to each in a loving way exactly what is needed now. That is why I encourage you to write if you have an interest in doing so--you have something unique to say and yes, some of it also may have been said by others! All I'm saying is give it a try. If you are interested in a "dream pen pal" just write a letter through "Dreamline" with your dream interests (indicating you want your name and address pub1ished). If you have created something related to dreaming you can advertise in DC. That is why I suggested barter or donation in exchange for an ad. My hope is that you will be encouraged to follow your dreams, to create from them if there is a market available and I, in turn benefit by being able to read or use the dream product, keeping me in touch with the latest. I encourage you to tell us about the books you've found helpful (or not). I also hope we can begin sharing our dreams. I've learned so much just by reading about others dreams and what they've learned from them. May your dreams be a blessing to you.

Peace,

enacting dreams until their resolution is effected. The functional word for healing is resolution. To resolve a conflict is to heal it, either through forming a new unity out of the conflicting parts, or through sacrifice and ending of that which is no longer relevant to new life.

## The Method of Dream Reentry

My most central technique for effecting healing in the dream state and in life is Dream Reentry, my term for reentering and reexperiencing a dream with eyes closed in the meditative state. Most dreams seem to present issues and dynamics which seem unresolved. A student was tested as possibly having cervical cancer and worked with this symbolically and through the dream state. A crucial dream came in which she was to confront and deal with a large woman made of earth lying on the earth. In the orginal dream she as her dream ego was too afraid to approach the woman. I guided her through an extremely intense dream reentry in which she touched and brought to life the body of this woman, an important experience for her. When she was again tested for cancer the test showed her clear.

There is no way I can claim credit for the physical change, but I do know that we worked directly to actualize the dream state regarding her condition. In theory, the dreams could have reflected the unconscious condition of her psyche, a sort of mirroring effect of what needs dealing with. Then through dream reentry the ego, the conscious choice-making side of the personality, enters the unconscious field and interacts with it to evoke acceptance and healing. Cancer here would represent a symptom, some neglect in the psyche which is also a neglect in the body.

Another case of physical healing in relation to dreamwork involves the following. This woman in her thirties had been suffering from severe bouts of ulcerative colitis over the years. Psychologically she did not know how to handle and process her anger and her fears. She came to me for intensive dreamwork and together we decided that she would place herself under the care of a medical doctor who practiced only homeopathy, a non-traditional and non-medication approach to healing. At the same time she entered into an intensive program of therapy and dreamwork with me. The bleeding from her colon was severe and she suffered a great loss of energy, keeping her in bed for months and months. But through the whole time we both assisted her in staying with the process. She was to experience fully whatever came up for her, emotionally, physically and in dreams. This following an ancient healing principle that the sickness is the cure. Most modern medicine tries to attack and overwhelm the symptoms instead of assisting the person in going through the sickness. What we were after, of course, was evoking the self-healing part of herself. Homeopathy and Jungian-Senoi dreamwork both focus on self-healing. But who among us likes to go through the fire of transformation, to suffer until healing occurs.

These are summaries of some of her most healing dreams during the period of the illness. This first dream occurred during the period when she was very sick, unable to sleep and experiencing night sweats. In a number of her previous dreams she had always gone past a certain door and never opened it out of extreme fear and anxiety. In this dream she opens the door and there down below is a man about to execute her father. She rushes down and prevents this from happening.

It may be hard to capture the drama of the situation from a few images, but I can assure you that this was seen by her as a major breakthrough. For it represented to her that now she had the ability to open the door without first knowing what is behind it. And she does open it and there one of her worst fears materializes and she does something about it. No longer does she have to feel completely helpless in the face of potentially overwhelming circumstances. Enduring her sickness, going through it, not knowing whether she was going to live or die, was her dreamwork! Earlier in her life this illness had put her in the hospital and almost killed her. Now she was face to face with the fear, endless long hours of it. The dreams helped provide the perspective on her whole experience. She had to know that healing was possible and that it could come from her. She would sometimes ask me, is this process working? and I would have to answer, well, is it? The one thing I could not allow myself to do was try and open any doors for her.

(Continued on Page 3 )

Healing \& Dreams Continued

This next dream occurred when she was out of bed and getting her energy back. The symptoms were mostly gone and at the same time she had experienced a real transformation of personality. She dreamed that she was going into a barn with her mother and leading a black cow. She finds an overweight woman there with ulcerative colitis whom she tells that she too can be healed. Then the dreamer takes the woman on her own back and carries her! Again the drama of transformation. Rather than being overcome by the sickness and identified with despairing attitudes, she can now demonstrate through her own accomplishment that healing is possible.

The earlier stage of healing was more one of desperation. The reqular medical model of treatment involved destructive drug therapies such as cortisone treatments which had been debilitating to her before. Holistic health and Jungian dreamwork offered an alternative. Their spiritual principles were a lot clearer and better than Western science and medicine. Jung also makes the point in his works along similar lines that the cure is finding the meaning in the situation, that ultimately healing is the cure of souls. I could go into how she worked with the symbolism of the dream but here I have room only for the essential

This last dream example occured when she was again quite active in her life and in dealing with the world. This dream is fascinating in that it shows us a way to deal with the darkness in life and in the psyche. To summarize, in this dream the dreamer is sitting calmly in a very dark place and is herself covered with blood. It is and feels like a place of absolute darkness, yet she feels centered and not afraid. However, a friend there cries out, how terrible! There she is and look what is happening to her. She stays relaxed and laughs. She is accepting the situation and is not overwhelmed by it. A whole philosophy of life could be built around this dream. How many of us are capable of enduring the darkness until healing and resolution occurs? Most of us tend to identify with the terrors of life and flee from them, at least until we come to our senses. I could recall and describe the nights and days of debilitating terror this person experienced, including mental states of sheer darkness. But no, the emphasis is on healing, the resolutions and new life which can come out of such an experience.

Dream reentry was not the primary method used here. We discussed the dreams and their implications and she did thousands of pages of journalwork around her dreams and the issues. She also painted some of the symbols including a series of mandalas.

Another example of dreamwork healing involved a Viet Nam veteran suffering from a nightmare literally created by a war trauma. I include it here because I, like many others, are concerned about the fate of war veterans whose scars affect severely the rest of their lives. In this situation the man was a priest who kept having a recurrent nightmare of hearing the helicopters come in the afternoon with the wounded and the dead and going into his chapel to get his ritual objects for administering the last rites to the dead. In the dream over and over again he comes to the door to the receiving room and wakes up. He will not enter that door!

He asked me for help and I led him in a guided dream reentry in which he opened the door and went into the receiving room. The first time he just described going in, looking around, and coming back out. I asked him if he would be willing to go in again and just stay there awhile and focus on something, just let his eyes wander until he came on something which had sigificance for him.

He is in the room again and at the side of a soldier with a hugh bandage on his head. He tries to see the face touching the bandage and a doctor gets mad at him saying that if he removes the bandage the man's brains will fall out. He looks at the wrist identification and the dying man is one whom he had met two weeks ago. They had both talked lightheartedly about how they were leaving Viet Nam soon, their tour of duty up. The now dead man had shown the dreamer a picture of his wife and small daughter.

This was the revelation, the truth which the priest could not face for ten years, but which the dream source kept bringing back to him in his nightmares. I suggested he might go now, still. in the dream, and have a dialogue with God, even get angry with Him. We talked afterward. What had been hardest to take is how God could let such a terrible thing like this happen. His concept of an all powerful and all loving God did not encompass this reality, the dark and terrible side of life.

We can almost conclude that working with dreams for healing means including all sides of life, what we like and what we hate, what is creative and what is destructive. Reality is reality and dreams seem to want us to face reality as it really is and not as we would like. it to be.

Dreams and dreamwork can be central to any healing process involving the soul, the inner and meaningful content of a person. We look to the dreams, and the source behind the dreams, for the healing, for the bringing to resolution of the particular conflict in life.

For the war veteran, he never had that nightmare again, and for the first time in ten years he was able to sleep all night now unafraid of having that terrible dream anymore. What most intrigues people, of course, who work in this kind of process is that the healing and the dreams come from within and not some external authority or source.

Applying the above principles and examples to our own lives we might well ask, how well are we practicing the principle of bringing resolution in our own lives? Each day, and every relationship which is at aII real, is in constant need of resolution and healing. We accept the issues and deal with them using all the resources available. We do not try and run from the way things really are. We all know somewhere that the dream is probably the most honest side of ourselves and that we need to face that which we would hide or run from in ourselves and in life. The examples I have used here are powerful and dramatic to show a point, that healing can work in the most severe of circumstances. But it is into the everyday world that we must most venture for healing. It is in the little things also that the process continues so that we may be ready for the big events when they come along.

The dreams do not do the healing. They present the issues and the potentials for resolution. But the resolution occurs because we consciously participate and choose healing in our lives. We become healers to ourselves. Strephon Kaplan Williams is a Leading neseanchen, teachen and thenapist in dreamwonk and Jungian prychology.

I've been recording my dreams for years and working with them to some extent, but it hasn't been until about the last two years that I've really delved into their symbolisms and/or messages. I do believe that dreams are messages or lessons, either from one's subconscious or from one's guides or higher consciousness, imparting some help in inner and spiritual growth. For me, dreams have helped me to see "me," how I view and relate and react to the world around me. This growing realization of one's self is, I feel, the reason why we keep coming back, because it's through knowing ourselves, the divine and human in each of us, that we can then interact in a loving and positive way with fellow humans, with life, and with God. or the Cosmic Consciousness. Or the All That Is.

It's important to realize that symbols will vary with each individual--we do not all see an eagle in the same way--but I think until we can feel comfortable and
knowledgeable with our own symbolism, general interpretations of common symbols might be very helpful. For example, an eagle is a proud, strong, soaring bird--a symbol of our country. However, we must pursue the interpretation further than any book can take us and even be willing to refuse the general definition if our intuition tells us that it is wrong in a certain case.

Defining and understanding symbols is, of course, the crux of the matter for, unless we can know what energy or aspect of ourselves the animal, person, or object represents, we can miss the whole lesson of the dream. Following the suggestions of several authors, I have "placed in a chair" or gestalted different symbols of a dream and asked them their meaning, the reason for their existence in my nighttime scenario. I have received some wonderful help with that method. Meditating upon the dream and allowing the answers to rise to the conscious level is also valuable. And I also use the pendulum.

There are times when, for whatever reason, I use neither the "chair" method nor meditation, but the dream is of such vividness or so unusual that as I go about my chores I'm subliminally mulling it over. At some point, I hit upon a meaningful interpretation and often rush to my pendulum to see if I'm on the right track. For me, it's a quick method of ascertaining a direction to take when I do meditate or use some other method.

An example of this happened recently.

DREAM: "Ann" calls me on the phone and we just chit chat for awhile. Then she begins

telling me that she must see me, that she has something very important to teach me. She's very urgent and keeps impressing on me that it must be done quickly for there were negative forces that would try to hinder this meeting or growth. All through this part of the conversation, the connection keeps getting worse and worse and I feel that this is caused by the negativity she speaks of. Ann also urges me to "bring a friend" who can help me in learning this new step. By this time the connection is so bad that I tell her I must call her back because I can't understand any of what she's saying. I hang up, frantically look up her number, and begin dialing.

"Ann" is the name I'm giving to a wonderful and very spiritual psychic reader in this area to whom I've gone several times. To me she represents a "higher" level of growth, a giving of abilities and a willingness to be a channel to help others. On first awakening from the dream, my immediate inclination was to call her and see if she indeed had something to tell me, but I hesitated. She is very busy right now, and I know also how easy it is for me to let others do my interpreting rather than using my own intuition and spiritual help. For some reason I was also
hesitanit about meditating upon it and completely forgot the "chair" method, so at the suggestion of a friend, I used my pendulum.

A pendulum answers only yes or no questions. My first question was, "Does Ann want to get in touch with me?" Answer: "No." some part of myself?" Answer: "Yes." With a few more questions, I finally learned that Ann, in the dream, represented my higher self or higher consciousness. Now it was time to meditate.

Before I began, my own intuition blazed at me (sometimes it needs to actually knock me over because I can be a bit dense) that the "friend" I was supposed to bring was my little self or subconscious. It was making more and more sense. Some "higher" part of me wanted to tell me something, and I needed an awareness that all parts of me had to be present at this "meeting." I am not constantly aware of all levels of my being; I do believe, however, that an active verbalization and desire can mesh those levels though we may not be consciously aware of the communication between them.

During the meditation, I received the impression that this "new step" and the message concerned a new awareness within me, a gain and help in my own struggle along the path. It's as though a "merger" is being achieved so that I am able to be more open not only with my emotions and feelings, but also with what I've experienced and learned these past few years. I had gone through an inner time and now the cycle is returning to an outer time, an attestation and a giving.

I also look for synchronicity. Dreams usually relate to a process I'm experiencing or learning, or a meditation or reading I've recently had. Realizing this, the interpretation of the symbolism and the application of the lesson increases the learning--or at least the potential for learning--tenfold.

This is one way that dreams, along with meditation, psychic readings, crystal sessions, my own venture into the writing field and many other things, have gently led me onward, have shown me to myself, and have given me more confidence in my own intuition and guides.

## DREAMS WORKSHOP AT WRITER'S CONFERENCE

## Lila Line

This summer, I conducted a week long workshop entitled, THE WRITER AND HER DREAMS, at the 13th International Womens Writing Guild Conference at Skidmore College, July 27-August 3. It was the first time a dream workshop was offered at the conference and I did not know what to expect. As it turned out, I was overwhelmed by the interest and enthusiasm of my class. Sixty or more conferees attended the first two workshops and many continued to come the remainder of the week. Because of the size of the groups, we were unable to discuss individual dreams at length.

At the class opening, after a quiet "centering in" exercise, I asked that each woman tell her name, where she was from (members come from everywhere -- Brazil,
Australia, Hawaii -- as well as nearby states), and to tell whether or not they habitually recall their dreams and record them. The hour and 15 minutes went too quickly. We found that some who had never before recalled dreams, began to recall them; they sought me out at mealtime to discuss those dreams. A young actress had a dream after attending one class that she feels told her what psychicatrists had been trying to find out for years. Deeply obsessed with abandonment after the death of a younger sister, the woman felt that this dream had pinpointed something significant that had never before been disclosed. Another woman, who was having marital problems in her 34 -year marriage, cried in class when something triggered her first dream recall. Interpretation revealed a solution to a long-term problem. One student told us she dreams entire plays; another said she dreams plots and characters and has developed a technique of calling upon her characters to help further the plot.

There is obviously much more to discover about dreams and writing. This proved such a stimulating experience that I have decided to offer similar workshops in my area.

## DONATIONS

My thanks to Brad May Ph.D. (San Diego, CA) and Maurice Stein (Foremost, Alberta, Canada) for their donations. All donations are cheerfully accepted! Maybe you can help me with ideas too. I want to make enough money to pay for printing and supplies (which I don't now) and hopefully, sometime to pay for dream conferences, books, magazines etc. I want to do this by finding additional sources of revenue with the newsletter. I did have one idea. If you are giving a workshop or class on dreams and felt one of the issues of DREAM CRAFT would be a nice bonus for your class, we could agree on a donation in exchange for copies for the class. If you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them.

THE DREAM GUIDE by Marie Fay, is a unique workbook designed to help you understand your dreams. It is an outgrowth of dream workshops led by the author at the center for the Healing Arts in Los Angeles; a wholistic health center concentrating on healing both physical and mental manifestations of illness. The book itself is a step-by-step, how-to manual, with emphasis on expressing manifest dreams, in writing and drawing. It is a helpful tool, artfully illustrated with Indian drawings and poetry, and is beneficial to students new to dream work. It is a basic text, very easily understood, well thought out, and fun, too! (Published by the Center of the Healing Arts, 11081 Missouri Avenue, West Los Angeles, CA 90025.)

## Walter Friesendorf

In the past I used to compile a list of different types of dreams. Every time I read a dream book or spoke to a serious dreamer I added a few more types to my list. I no longer keep such a Iist; having run out of paper a long time ago! I concluded that there are an infinite number of dream types.

My pet peeve of dream types is the psychic dream and the clairvoyant dream. Saying you had a psychic dream or a clairvoyant dream is like saying the ocean is filled with "wet water" or that 200 "people persons" attended the party. The dictionary describes psychic as: 1) Having to do with the mind; 2) Beyond known natural or physical processes; and 3) Sensitivity to forces beyond the physical world.

Dreams are most certainly of the mind and beyond the physical. Science does not yet fully understand their nature, especially pre-cognitive and lucid dreams. Would we not be correct in saying that dreams are a form of psychic functioning?

Clairvoyance is defined as: 1) To see clearly and 2) Keen perception or insight. When clairvoyant mediums give a reading, they see images, signs and symbols. These, they interpret and pass the message on to their subject or client. Sounds like a dream except that it occurs in a state of full consciousness, or at least what appears to be full consciousness. To me, there is no difference between a clairvoyant medium's images and those of a dreamer. Both experience signs and symbols which communicate information about the past, present and future.

Saying you have a clairvoyant or a psychic dream is redundant. When you dream, you are having a psychic experience. Dreaming is a form of psychic functioning. Dreaming is clairvoyance. A clairvoyant experience, while asleep, is a dream.

the A little summary of my experiences: In subjectively, letting the paintings reveal my Unconscious. I also began reading the few books by and about Carl Jung then available in the Denver Public Library. In this way I stumbled on P.T. Martin's book EXPERIMENT IN DEPTH and started my own journey, recording dreams, using active imaginatin and the many odd symbolic events that began to occur. I kept an extensive journal of dreams with a little self-analysis and as much amplification as possible. My experiment began in earnest in 1957 and culminated in an inner religious experience, "given" poetry and many psychic experiences in 1964. Unfortunately (or maybe not) in a major move to the Northwest I discarded all the notes I had accumulated until then except a long letter to a teacher who returned it. The letter was a summary of what I considered most important to me spiritualiy.

All my Big Dreams (some from early childhood) stand in my memory as clear as anything from mundane life - and clearer than most. Dreams still come when something happens to stimulate my interest - such as reading the DREAM CRAFT notice in the IWWG Bulletin. My extraverted nature seems to do best when stimulation comes from outside. When I was deep in my Experiment I had a couple of artist friends I could talk to on occasion. But I think I managed to stay involved because I could relate to the inner figures as though they were outside - or at least characters separate from my "Me."

(EXPERIMENT IN DEPTH, by P.W. Martin, Routledge \& Kegan Paul Pub.., Broadway House, Carter Lane, London, England. First ed. 1955.)
I am a poet/jazz musician who has had extremely vivid dreams since 1973. My dreams are always in. color, and always have people intensely present in their landscapes. As a writer, I have been able to utilize my dreams in my journals and in occasional poems, and have found them to hold keys to the meaning of my psychological/spiritual existence.

Most often, my dreams are so intense that I do not forget them. Once I dreamt that my mother and her dear friend were standing next to a beautiful pond, and in the pond was a kind of catfish. Silver minnows fell from the sky like rain. Each time the catfish lifted out of the water it became ill and shriveled. But it seemed beautiful swimming in the water. At the time of this dream I had a friend who was an astrologer. She told me that water was a maternal symbol, and asked me if my mother's friend had a child who was sick. I replied affirmatively; my mother's friend had a child who had been in a car accident, and was now involved in a religious cult, to the chagrin of both women. My friend advised me that the young man was well off following his own inclinations, and should not listen to those who told him to leave the religious group. I found this advice stunning, and also recognized the catfish as a dual symbol: a sign that I was somehow connected with the son, and should also be true to my own intuition.

My dreams of water, which are often euphoric, are less frequent when I meditate. I believe people often move into higher meditative states in dreams, and if this need is filled when they are awake and conscious, then the dreams will try to unlock other realms.

I also believe that dreams are a bridge between those who inhabit this wor1d and those who inhabit other worlds. Once, I dreamed of a planet on which the roads werre indigo, and the skyscrapers deep red. It seemed to be morning, early, there was no one around. But it was, in the dream, a world I knew. Likewise, people often dream of loved ones who have died. I do think dreams can serve as portals for messages in this way.

Some dreams are so vivid they become as real as life. The dreamer actually becomes conscious that he is looking at the floor, the ceiling, himself, is scaling the intricate walls of a mountain or observing the weblike configurations of a leather jacket on the chair. These are astral dreams in the most conscious sense, and are, to my know1edge, marked by a heightened visual acumen.

From my experiences, all dreams are gifts, even the nightmares; gifts which mark the deepest layers of our human connections, and speak of the intense configurations through which we move, as humans, towards transcendence.

With genuine interest,

Movie Review: DREAMSCAPE who like dreams and sci-fi/thrillers.

Suzanne Keyes

"Dreamscape" will no longer be in movie theatres by the time you read this review, but is a good candidate for cable television and video movie release. This is an imaginative fantasy thriller staring Dennis ("The Right Stuff") Quaid and Kate ("Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom") Capshaw. Veteran actors Max von Sydow and Christopher plummer round out the main cast.

Dennis Quaid plays a young man who hasn't found a way to channel his great psychic gifts. He's making his living betting on horses, but has gotten in trouble with some toughs who want to cash in on his talent. Max von Sydow is a researcher who tested Quaid when he was 19, but the boy ran away, again perceiving that he was being used--this time to promote von Sydow's career. Von Sydow is now sponsored by the government in a top secret $1 \mathrm{ab}$ involving research where psychics are actualiy going into the dreams of others where they can help them confront nightmare figures or observe and report troubling unremembered dreams. Von Sydow sends for Quaid who wants no part of the project, but is "taken for a ride" to the lab to avoid being caught by the track toughs.

Christopher Plummer, the head of a super-secret government agency, really runs the project. He is supposedly a part of this research project to help the President who is having nightmares of nuclear disasters, but Plummer, the sublime villain, has an ulterior motive and has recruited an unbalanced psychic as a "dream assassin." When Quaid is brought to the $1 a b$ by von Sydow he finds he genuinely cares for these troubled dreamers and has an extraordinary talent for entering their dreams. The stage is set for a confrontation with Quaid and the unbalanced psychic in one of the president's nuclear nightmares. Dennis Quaid plays a very charming and believable character. His romance with Kate Capshaw makes an engaging subplot with an erotic (and fully clothed!) dream sequence which leads to a nice twist to the end of the story.

The movie is entertaining and I especially enjoyed the scenes in the research $1 a b$ and the dream sequences (the best in any movie I've seen). Even though most of the dream sequences involve dreamers having nightmares, the scenes depend more on eerie effects than violence, appealing to the imagination of the viewer. As a matter of fact, the only weakness I really found in the movie was that the plot involving Christopher Plummer trying to bump off the president with a dream assassin wasn't as believable to me as all the scenes involving Quaid learning to go into the dreams, helping the dreamers confront their fears and discovering what the unbalanced psychic was up to. There was a drag to the story for me while I waited for them to "get to the good stuff."

I am involved in a group dreaming project so it was interesting to see how they handled the subject. From my experience in the project we do dream together and we experience dream telepathy. The movie though is science fiction/fantasy in this respect: the premise is that the psychic is physically present in the dream therefore he and the dreamer's body can be affected. I liked the idea they were
