This article is about a health issue, and the information that I received about it, in my dreams, long before it became manifest sufficiently for a doctor to perceive it, and give a correct diagnosis.

My dreams were preparing me for something for a long time. They came two or three times a week, and had what I can only describe as an urgency to them that made me pay particular attention.

I am very aware that my dreams are idiosyncratic and ego-centric just like everyone's dreams. I am hoping as I outline them briefly, you will be able to leap an intuitive bridge between your waking logic and my dreams translated into words.

Now, I know that it started more than two years ago. Probably three, because the dream about it began approximately three years ago. At least that as far back in my dream transcriptions that I can go now and recognize the messages.

Then, my dreams seemed to be telling me that something was wrong in a specific area of my life; but initially 1 couldn't figure out what they were referring to. I kept looking for what I thought were metaphors, personal myths, etc., around my current life issues and only got confused.

Following are two short dreams, from early in the series, that I hope will give you an idea of the clarity of the dreams, and their obscurity as to meaning for me at that time.

1) My jade plant is having a Near Death Experience. I feel sad.

In the last issue, we mentioned that NB was beginning to attract some hational attention. That trend has been continuling. The expected Saturday Review piece appeared in the August/September issue, and we've had about two dozen inquiries from their review. DNB was referenced in the July 28 issue of Brain/Mind Bulletin, but it isn't clear that we received any inquiries from that one. There was a nice write-up about DNB in the September/Ocotber issue of The Common Boundary, which has yielded one subscription so far. Finally, the summer issue of The Chrysler-Plymouth Spectator contained an offer to send a sample copy of DNB to readers. In response to that article, over 550 people wrote in for a free DNB but, as of this writing, none of them has become a subscriber.

Meanwhile, we have been mailing out promotional flyers to various mailing lists. This approach has proven to be the most effective. Currently, l've been spending hours sitting on the floor affixing labels and stamping over 5500 flyers for our biggest mailing yet! As ! go through that mundane task, I pray with each repetitive movement of my arms that these efforts will reach an appreciate audience and not simply be ssed in the trash, as I do myself with o much of my junk mail.
Thus, the quest continues as we seek ta discover new dreem appreciators. We need all you loyalists out there to stay with us, as well as we need your help in locating additional subscribers. We'll be glad to send you a few DNB flyers to pass out to folks who you think might be prospective appreclators. Drop Lyn a note indicating how many you could hand distribute or post on suitable bulletin boards.

Meanwhile, I think we are continuing to produce a worthwhile magazine for your enjoyment and benefit. Stories like the ones you'll read in this issue can't help but to add to the growing body of evidence that dreams provide real, valid and important information. I continue to be impressed by the various personal accounts, of such a wide variety, testifying to the value of dreams. I am also pleased that there are folks out there who are continuing to develop new methods for extracting the gold from the

dream nuggets. I am especially grateful that these various dream adventurers are taking the time to become dream authors and write up their experiences for DNB. Otherwise, we would have no magazine.
As good of a job as Lyn does in designing each issue, she can't pull the material out of thin air. So please do continue with your written contributions. And let's not sit back and allow all our artwork to come from Norma Churchill and the Dover Archive series. We'd like to see more of you try your hand at drawing one of your dreams. We're hungry for art and would welcome your creative efforts.

In another vein, I just returned from a trip to New Mexico with an old friend, Gary Rogers, and his wife Esperanza. Next summer we are planning to offer a week long workshop on dreams at Angel Fire, a vacation resort located about 30 miles southeast of Taos. Henry Reed will be joining Gary and me during that third week in July. Participants will be housed in comfortable condos in a beautiful mountain setting. Mornings and evenings will be devoted to dream sharing and exploration, while afternoons would be unscheduled so that participants could avail themselves of the opportunity to sun bathe, play golf, tennis, fish, ride horseback or hike on wooded trails. We hope to have a demonstration of Native American dances and a chance to hear about dream beliefs and practices from some elders from the Taos Pueblo. Both Taos and Santa Fe of fer music festivals during July and there are a great variety of art galleries, museums, and other cultural experiences available. You could plan to include visits to these and other interesting Southwestern locations during your summer vacation before or after the dream workshop in Angel Fire. Enrollment will be limited to around 25 participants.

If you think you might be interested in joining Bob, Henry, and Gary for an unforgettable dream experience in New Mexico next july, drop Bob a note to let him know about your interest. Further information will be sent as details become firmed up.

## Continued from Page 1

2) I have a Guardian who is trying to help me play out my life role to its limit. There's a barrier I'm having difficulty with. I hear music. (Mozart's Eine Klaine Nachtmusik)

After about a year of struggling to understand what was being shown to me, I grasped that it was a physical problem. A major reason why l'd ignored this as a possibility is that one of my personal myths is that I never get very sick. I've only had one serious illness in my life.

Accepting the premise that it might be about something physical, I dreamed:

3) I'm trying to take a big step across a wide crevasse. It's a familiar place, but I can't do it.
4) I'm at my mother's, sitting on the toilet making a phone call to a doctor for an appointment. A Black man appears. I know that I'm in for a rough time.
5) I take a big step across an unexpected pit. I see a crowd of people around me looking on approvingly. While dreaming, I remember the dream of several weeks ago when I couldn't cross the crevasse. I become aware of a positive shift somewhere in me.

By then I did have a small external symptom; but no pain, nothing was alarming me. Ater I made an appointment at a clinic for a physical exam, this series of dreams stopped. I was told at the clinic that I might have a slight infection, and I was given a prescription. The symptom persisted. The dream started up about one month later.

6) I tell someone that I'm dying of brain cancer that it's in all the bones in my head, it's painful and will get worse. 1 hear music. (Unidentified.)

A few more dreams as dramatic as that one and I made another appointment at the clinic. I saw someone different. Diagnosis the same. After I made this appointment the dreams stopped, and started up about a month afterwards.

7) I'm with my identical twin. (1 don't have one.) My twin tries to rescue me. I justify and defend my position. (I don't know what it was.) I hear the song: We Shall Overcome.

I thought well, my sub-conscious has faith, but I'm not understanding the messages. Maybe I'm trying to be too literal. And the dreams persisted.

8) Someone is giving me flying lessons. I don't think I'm ready to fly alone, but I have to and I manage very well. I fly over the ocean and see a pod of whales.
9) I'm pregnant in the ninth month, in labor. On my way to the doctor's I stop and look at three birds. Two fly away. The third, an elderly bird, thinks I'm bird, too, and gossips with me. I'm amused. Labor increases. I leave for the

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-04.jpg?height=1006&width=1301&top_left_y=1443&top_left_x=108)

N.J. Churchill doctor's. On the way I see several scenes of rescue. Baby is imminent, but I don't deliver.

I made a third appointment at the same clinic and saw a third medica person with an experience that paralleled the first two. The pattern in my dreams repeated similarly, also. About a month later 1 dreamed:

10) Someone has misunderstood information about female reproductive organs. I feel comfortable explaining correctly about them.

This was very specific. I made an appointment with a gynecologist. The information from the woman doctor was similar as the three previous practitioners, except that she added that I was hysterical. Soon after this I dreamed:

II) Every time 1 try and set a situation up correctly, someone interferes with it and subverts it.

12) I need to change the interior of a house. Every time I go to make the changes, there's interference and I don't.

In spite of these last two dreams, I'm figuring I must be pretty dense. Here I am, a person who's been involved with her dreams for over ten years; reading about dreams, everything I can lay my hands and eyes on; attending dream workshops; running dream workshops; checking out my dreams daily fo help and understanding about my inner and outer life; thinking that I was learning and growing in understanding of my dreams and what they had to tell me about myself. And I still couldn't decipher this long series of dreams.

I'd been married to a physician at one time. I certainly knew that doctors weren't gods. But I rationalized that $1 \cdot$ was being examined and tests were being administered and checked out by people whom I believed knew more about the inner mechanics of my body than I did. Nothing showed up in the tests. (Is it possible that they weren't looking in the right place?) On the other hand, I had no symptoms that I could point to or identify. I wondered if it was all in my head.

In spite of that kind of mental per severation I did persist, right through to doctor number six, who said in his medically euphemistic way, "We have to think about cancer." and referred me to doctor number seven.

Following this visit I dreamed:

13) I have to go South to get something. I do but its not ready. I circle around and come back. Then it's a smooth operation.
14) Number seven needs a break.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-05.jpg?height=628&width=710&top_left_y=144&top_left_x=35)

I went to see doctor number seven, having heard the two doctors agree on the phone that a biopsy was needed and I would have one in his office. Number seven examined me and decided to do a 0.\& C. right there. As an aside to any woman reading this do not agree to have a D.\& C. performed in the doctor's office with only an injection of pain-killer unless its an emergency. It is a brutal procedure. Have it done in the operating room with anesthesia.

A week later when the pathologist's report got to the doctor, he told me laconically over the phone that I had a well-differentiated malignant carcinoma, hd that I needed an operation. It was the end of February this year.

I'm very paradoxical. I had commitments on my job. I had private clients who needed some preparation if I was to be out of commission for a while and workshops lined-up for the Spring. I asked if I could postpone the operation until the end of June. "No.", said the doctor. "How about the end of April?", I asked. The doctor said that he needed a break (see Dream \#14) and would be away the last two weeks in March, and to call him early in April. Soon afterwards I dreamed:

15) My executive self had a conference with myself. There was an agreement.

This was followed by a number of dreams about people I know who have died of cancer, and several people who as far as I know are perfectly healthy also dying of cancer.

I called the doctor's of fice the first Monday in April and was operated on the following week. 1 went home early on the fourth day because there were no complications. I felt good, considering. I was an ornery patient and I suspect ey were glad to get rid of me.

Two weeks later when the doctor read me the pathologist's report after the operation, he said that it had been found that either the cancer had grown very rapidly since the D. \& C. or there might have been an error in the first report. The cancer was found to be more extensive than orıginally detected. However, he believes that he "got it all." However, he did recommend radiation in case he didn't. I have refused it.

Cancer takes from you. It certainly took from me. Those last two years I felt old, tired, strung out. I was often cantankerous. Now, I feel good. When people see me now there has been a unif orm reaction. With seeming surprise they all have said, "You look so good. I'd expected-----," and their voice trails of $f$ in embarrassment. I giggle and hug 'em.

I feel validated now in myself and my dreams, and the help that they they offer, even if 1 am slow about the specifics.

The dreams about my body with the attendant feeling that I must attend to something have stopped.

During all of the time that this series of dreams was going on I told no one about them. My Western culturally educated self was denying their meanings and/or confused by them, or a part of me was. How could I expect others raised at the same time and in the same culture to accept them if I was having such difficulty? I'm glad that I had enough faith in myself and my dreams to continue until the cancer was recognized and removed.

I hope that my experience may encourage others when they are discouraged by outside authority figures, and are in the middle of their own obsfucations and dreams, to persist.

A bonus for me since the operation has been a much greater understanding of my dreams so that I frequently "know" what is being given to me while I'm dreaming and I wake up smiling.

## THE DREAM HELPER CEREMONY

YESHUA MEDICINE HEART
Editor's note: The Dream Helper Ceremony is a procedure originated by Henry Reed and Bob Van de Castle to utilize the telepathic potential of dreams in a group setting to facilitate better understanding and healing for a selected member (target person) of the group. Some references to our earlier work in this area appear in the DNB Editorial for Vol. 4 \#5 and a more detailed presentation is available in Henry's book, Getting Help From Your Dreams.

During the Summer of 1986, both Henry and Bob gave several presentations on dreams to the A.R.E. in Virginia Beach. One of Henry's offerings involved an opportunity for the audience of approximately 80 people to participate in the Dream Helper Ceremony. Here is a brief edited account of one of the 10 people selected to be a target-person.

## THE MOVE

Recently, I participated in one of Henry Reed's Dream Helper Ceremonies. I was fortunate in having my name drawn to become one of the targets. There were 7 dreamers in my group. We formed a circle for a few minutes to bond our consciousnesses. I gave each of them a talisman article from my person, such as my watch, pen, belt, etc. These dreamers then went of $f$ to dream a dream for me which was to help me with my question. They were not told my question until next morning after they had shared their dreams. My question, which I also dreamed on was, "Should I move to British Columbia from Toronto?" During the night I had 4 dreams:

1) I am planing the edges of two pieces of wood. The edges are rough to start with, kind of serrated. Both pieces have the same curve.
2) I drive my pickup truck around to the backyard and back in past the garage to the apple tree. Two people, a man and a woman, come out of the house. The man has his guitar. We are going to go up in the tree together to record our music making. The tree has 2 sides, one in full leaf and one bearing rich looking, but kind of nut like fruit. The woman when asked says she doesn't care which side we go up in first because she is simply going to journey. So I back the truck up under the leaf side and we put the step ladder in the pickup bed and climb up in the tree. I am going to record the sessions.
3) Something about peace between 2 warring tribes. But the warriors are away and just wait until the rainy season.
4) Someone asks me if I have been over to the roof top for a dive in the pool. I say no, but I can see the people up on the roof lounging around the pool.

These dreams indicated to me: I) I am fitting pieces together. 2) I am looking at things from 2 sides while enjoying myself in the process. 3) I can make peace between opposing sides of myself. 4) I am going to dive into my emotions from a high point of view.

The next morning I was astonished as the following dreams were told to me by my "helpers." These dreams are noted here in the same order they were told to me.

First Helper's Dream: An international committee meeting of 5 or 6 men; 2 of whom are Canadian. I am a leader. This group sits like a jury panel. New information is to be presented in front of the whole group. Group upset by presence of the leader bringing this news. Leader manages to tell the information to one man and this man asks why it wasn't told bef ore. Although the leader didn't know of this information before, he lies, and says he purposely withheld it. An announcement made that the leader is needed in another room. He feels this has been a polite contrived removal of his presence. Leader feels hurt, betrayed, failed. He sees his replacement happy, enthusiastic and being well received by the group. His pride is hurt.

Second Helper's Dream: I live on the ground floor; a friend lives on the top floor (very high building). I go to the top floor; the floor is shaky; I want out. Floor boards are weak, holes evident. I try to walk out, but end up crawling out. Floor strong in places. Dirty matting in places. I feel like I am walking the plank. Apartment unfit to live in. No roof. I try to help by washing dishes. I see my apartment far below with a large table and chairs, by no one there. Cross land lady says

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-06.jpg?height=1038&width=1068&top_left_y=1438&top_left_x=865)
place is in good shape. She wants to prove it by helping with the dish washing. Washing dishes is frightening because water from the wall sink verflows into my apartment below. Wood stacked up by the wall because too difficult to remove. Good thing a fireplace available to burn it.

People in the yard when I return, pairing up male-female. My husband is going to spend several hundred dollars to get things going.

Third Helper's Dreams: (This was told as a series of thoughts through the night rather than a dream.) For Better House Keeping magazine article. Rational thinking compounds the problem. Prefer talking to one versus a crowd. Want to help, feel anxious. Fear of failing to do what is asked; but being me is O.K. Sadness that past happy times are gone. Bicycling. A blazer, a pathfinder, travel the unknown.

Fourth Helper's Dream: Red car going North in front of the A.R.E. on Atlantic Blvd. Small paper airplane flies into car and out of the sun roof. A cameraman filming the A.R.E. sewing room. Seems to be under Bookstore, which is lighted. Rest of the building is dark. A paneled room. Heavy U-shaped table fastened to the wall. People seated around the table. Like a working committee.

Fifth Helper's Dream: Trading and cheating going on. I shoot a man, he besn't die. He fires at me and misses. run out of ammo. A protector is helping me, protecting me from the one firing. I seek shelter to reload my gun. I test fire my gun to be sure I have reloaded properly. I shoot him in the left shoulder and see a blood patch. He is captured, I am free. Gun put on the table; a knife there also. Also stacks of money I try to hide in drawers. I knew the money belonged to a missing young girl. I had the girl's check book and was searching for her signature in the filing cabinets to forge her checks. I wanted to divide her money amongst some children and adults to hide all traces of evidence. The children's money was put in a school fund out of fear that the people who hid the money would come and take it away.

Sixth Helper's Dream: A dream of moving. My husband didn't want to move. My room is pink. I am very sad thinking about moving.

Seventh Helper's Dream: A woman and a young man on a park bench are kissing and hugging. There is a young woman on the bench to the right of the young man. She is eavesdropping. The couple decide to move to another bench. On this bench a lady and a young boy sit

the left of the woman. The lady says, Are you going to have sex right here now? l've been watching you and you might as well."

## SUMMARY NOTES:

In all of these dreams there is some element of oscillation or ambivalence indicated. In dream I, the information is ignored and sought after. In dream 2, when I get somewhere I want out. In dream 3 , I want to help but feel anxious. In dream 4, A.R.E. is portrayed as light and dark. In dream 5 , I clear the way for the money and then feel guilty about having it. In dream 6, although moving is necessary 1 am sad about it. In dream 7, I am integrating personally but I don't want anyone to see. This thread of oscillation is certainly the predominant issue I consciously had, at the time of this dream helper ceremony around considering my proposed move.

It is interesting to notice that only one of the 7 dreamers actually addresses the question of the move. It is important not to consider this a failed experiment, because the dreamers addressed much more fundamental issues present at a deeper level. The move is simply one of many trigger events I have had in my life. Here is a brief account of how these dreams tuned into some issues below the surface which influence the question about moving.

In dream 1, the dreamer hit on a specific personality trait of mine. I am a leader and'I of ten have insights (information) that I know would be of value to someone. Sometimes I do not speak out I purposely withhold out of some fear. I have battled with this one for years, always seeing both sides but sometimes choosing silence. The stronger hit in this first dream was in the last part. I recalled how I felt when I lost my farm a number of years ago. It always did feel like circumstances were contrived by universal forces to remove me from the farm. (This was to allow me to begin the work I now do.) One of the difficult things for me had been turning over the leadership of the organic farmers organization. Later I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the group, under the new leader, was doing better than

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-07.jpg?height=496&width=507&top_left_y=1937&top_left_x=779)

when I had led it. We see in this dream that my pattern when confronted with leaving a situation and having ambivalent feelings.

In dream 2, I pick up my life after I left the farm. I am living here and there, sometimes in not such pleasant places. What is significant is that in my new life as a spiritual leader I havn't enough income to support myself. I feel like I'm walking the plank. I of ten wash dishes where I am staying to 'pay my way'. Often in these situations my emotions do flow over, or stack up, and I burn them off by working harder than ever. The last 3 statements of this dream all seemed prophetic to me, especially the one about spending a few hundred dollars to get things going. I know I am on the edge of a maj or break through in my life and consciousness.

In the third dreamer's case, she felt she didn't dream, but awoke several times in the night with thoughts which she wrote down. Certainly most of these thoughts felt close to me at tre time.

In dream 4, some actual thoughts that I had were poignantly portrayed by the dreamer. There was also a sense of fun and amusement from this dreamer.

When dreamer 5 was telling her dream I could almost feel the aggressive pain in my left shoulder being released in one final burst. I have been working on this for some time and the problem had been mostly cleared away although I still was experiencing residual twinges from time to time. The appearance of the stacks of money was most reaffirming because I have been carrying the thought for years that some day all this spiritual cleansing is going to manifest as physical abundance. The part about the children's school fund was close to embarrassing because in reality I have been 'borrowing' money from my children's education fund to keep myself going. When I heard about the missing girl I immediately related it to my current thoughts about a daughter of mine who seems, from my viewpoint, to be missing out on some important aspects of her childhood.

Dream 6 was a direct statement of my feelings about the move.

In dream 7, the dreamer was picking up that in my workshops and counseling I am getting very direct in Jealing with the interpersonal relationsti,p issues that people have.

What I received from the dreamers were multilevel dreams. In addition, most of the dreamers werr able to interpret their own dreams as being relevant to themselves. Mind you, I stıll ria'n't answered my original question, but : :hve received a wonderful gift for which I thank all those involved.

I will call the writer of the following dream essay Marie in order to protect her identity. Marie has a masters degree in Social Work and is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Many years ago, Marie had a psychotic break and was diagnosed schizophrenic. Marie was never hospitalızed and has held down several jobs since her break. She has been on medication and in therapy most of the time since then.

Marie's symptoms included frightening experiences at night (feelings of being mutilated in her sleep, hearing volces outside her bedroom window, feeling the presence of individuals or beings in her apartment) and daytime paranoia. Marie was not a good dream recaller before her break and, except for the frightening night experiences, did not recall dreams during the year after her break.

About a year after her break, with some encouragement from myself, Marie began to remember her dreams. The dreams were mostly nightmares at first, and sleeping and nighttime in general were a source of much anxiety. I encouraged Marie to stay with her dreams and shared my feeling that there are no "bad" dreams and that nightmares are an opportunity to confront and overcome our fears. Marie did stay with her dreams and became a fairly regular dream recaller. Though she still had nightmares, they did not hold the terror for her that they once did.

In mid-February, 1976, Marie joined a dream class I was teaching. About one week after our first class, I was on a San Francisco radio talk show talking about dreams. Marie listened to the program and then went to bed. She had difficulty going to sleep as she kept thinking about the radio program. She finally slept and had a brief dream:

"I am with my sister and 1 call my father to come and pick us up."

Marie awoke with the dream at about 2 a.m. and began to have words,

## BOB TROWBRIDGE

phrases and thoughts going through her mind. It frightened her because she associated uncontrolled or "racing" thoughts with her illness. She tried to go back to sleep but the thoughts persisted. She even had a title going through her head.

Though it frightened her to do so, she finally got up and wrote down the essay that follows. I have made one word change and minor punctuation changes. Marie called me the morning of the dream and read the essay to me, asking if it was crazy or if it made sense. I will let you decide that for yourself.

1 think the essay is significant because it is an essay on dreams and cultural change that came out of the dream state itself. It is even more significant to me because it came from a woman whose waking life was not working because of her schizophrenia. It conforms and underscores for me the idea that within each of us is an objective, centered, wise self who is not affected by the problems of our daily life and is accessible to us in the dream state.

Let us, together, dream a better future.

## AN ESSAY ON CULTURE, CHANGE, EVOLUTION AND THE DREAMING PROCESS

Each culture carries with it a universal set of symbols. Jung talks about archetypes as being inherent in every culture. These archetypes have taken their meaning from the universal interpretation of dreams.

So what would it be to have a culture actually change? Change occurs through each individual's dream process. If a man can relate to his dreams and discover a meaning for his dreams which is counter to cultural norms, cultural change is possible.

Culture changes also from the true psychic liberation of each individual man.
If man can delve into his unconscious, especially through dreaming, and finally liberate himself from unconscious repetitive strivings, change can take place. And what better place for change to take place than in each individual man's interpretation of his dreamlike state?

Thus, if man can become truly conscious, if the lines between unconscious and conscious finally blur and break down, the culture will inevitably change. Man would indeed be healthier as he relates to both unconscious and conscious as if really one and the same. Here lies psychic liberation -- a free and healthy society free of neurosis, fear. and dread.

Since evolution is the process on man's becoming and since man is becoming, any attempt to individualize the interpretation of man's dreams speeds up the evolutionary process. Every known symbol possible to man is carried within his dreams. Know the dreams and change is inevitable in each person and thus in the interpretation of the universal symbols. Thus here, too, a culture can change.

Every man carries thus within himself the possibility of changing the entire culture through his dreams. Any attempt by man to delay this process results in stagnation, a dead and non-moving culture. Man carries the responsibility for his culture; for his dreams. Such a heavy burden rests with all of us. Change is possible but each man must make it his own personal course in order for the culture to truly change and develop.

So why not liberate each one of us from his dreamlike state and come forth into the true knowledge of the unconscious and a true change in culture?

## "Speak to Me,Rover"

## MARTHA S. FOLIN

There are all kinds of oreams. Freudian, Jungian, past, present, prec(rgnitive...the gieatest percentage are "se!f" dreams which deal with our thoughts, actions, personality, etc., however, I also have what I call "Rover" dreams. They deal with animals. Many people have a knack with animals. I don't, not really. I love them and fight for their rights, but if a dog growls at me, I get nervous! My rapport with animals seems to be in effect while I am sleeping.

For example, a few years ago, my daughters and I were having a great time on a camping trip until the third night when I dreamed about our pet duck. I saw him stumbling around in the garage. Someone had severed his neck! watched in horror as he stumbled and fell. Needless to say, I jumped up and began loading camping gear in the car. By daybreak I was on the road. What did I find when I arrived home? An almost dead duck! No, it wasn't from a severed neck. It was due to an inadequate feeder! The access hole for his beak was too small, consequently, he had been without food for three days and four

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-09.jpg?height=40&width=40&top_left_y=1304&top_left_x=68)
ghts. He was so weak he could not and. Thanks to a dream and loving care, he recouped quickly. Some might say that in the recesses of my mind I was aware of the problem but had to get past the hustle and bustle of activity for it to surface. Maybe, maybe not...after all a duck can't be the brightest or most psychic creature in the world or can he?

In a dream, my dog, Gus, told me he had worms and needed to go to the doctor. We went the next morning. Dr. Dennis Umlang looked at Gus, a picture of health, then asked why the visit. I told him Gus needed to be checked for worms. "Have you seen any evidence of worms?", he asked. "No." I answered, "but I still want him checked." The testing showed negative. I told Dr. Umlang the dream and asked that they try again. That's when he told me of the heartworm test which is costly but the only way to detect their presence. "Do it," I said. T.he test was positive! Ordinarily there is no real warning of heartworms. By the time symptoms appear it is of ten too late and treatment is dangerous due to the animal's weakened condition. Because of early detection, Gus survived the treatment with no damage to vital organs.

In "Rover" dreams the animals tell of their physical condition, their elings (yes, l've learned they have

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-09.jpg?height=715&width=594&top_left_y=301&top_left_x=752)

feelings!), and of their environment. As a kid, I had a Cocker Spaniel pup named Junior. One day he disappeared. I knew he was alive because of the dreams I was having. He showed me how he was growing in his "new backyard." I saw the tall wood fence, the flowers, a tool shed, even his feed bowl and dog house. After eleven months, I began dreaming of him more frequently. In one dream I told him I would be near "his" house and that when he heard my voice, start barking and don't stop. Three weeks later I was invited to a dance about four miles from my house. We arrived like normal 10 year old girls...noisy! While getting out of the car I became aware of an insistent barking. Remembering the dream, I realized it must be Junior! I took off running with screaming parents and kids behind me. After a few wrong turns, 1 found the right house and began pounding at the door. Junior flew into my arms the minute it opened. It was such a bizarre happening and Junior's information to me was so accurate that the "new" owners didn't even argue my claim to him.

Not all of the "Rover" dreams are so dramatic. For the most part, they deal with things like yukky catfood, too hot, too cold, don't feel good or I feel great, even I'll be in "season" soon...humdrum type stuff. Recently a neighbor brought a newborn kitten to my home hoping we would care for it. My daughter, Sydney, cleaned the blood of $f$ and put her in a box. Meanwhile, I left work at five armed with doll bottles and powdered milk. One evening after feeding her, I was wondering if she would live beyond her current three days old. Before I was fully asleep that night, I saw a picture of her at about seven weeks old, running and playing. She stopped, looked at me and said, "Of course I'm going to live!" Her name is Betsy and she has developed into a big, beautiful kitty that we all adore.

Just one more...this one has interesting aspects. It involves my dad and his English bulldog, Chauncey. They were big buddies. Chauncey even went to work with Dad. Several years after Chauncey's death, I dreamed of a female English bulldog who was very pregnant! A few weeks later, she appeared to me again, smiling proudly at two adorable puppies. One was brindle and the other was brindle and white. She showed me her house and street sign. The name of the street was Rosebud Lane. Then Chauncey appeared in the dream and told me he was returning and he would be the puppy that walked to me first! The next day I got the classifieds and started calling. It didn't take long, the second call was located on Rosebud Lane. When I arrived, the mother dog looked just as she had in the dreams. She even acted like she knew me. I stood back and waited. Shortly, the little brindle and white puppy waddled to me. Dad cried when I handed the pup to him. Reincarnated bulldog...why not? By the way, Chauncey had a nickname...it was Rosebud!

It would be silly to analyze the "Rover" dreams in the normal method of self analysis. It would also be silly to question their purpose which seems obvious. I feel, however, they do contain a deeper message. A message of the universal "oneness" among all creation. Not just human to human or animal to anımal or whatever. There seems to be a continuum involving the life force of all existence. I strongly suspect that in the early stages of human development, awareness of this "thread of life" through all matter was not only common knowledge, but that mental communication was also common practice. In our material progression we have become more dependent on machines, etc., thereby losing much of this ability. As we go through the process of reclaiming that self awareness, especially through dream study, I feel we regain some of this lost ground. It is plausible that in this high tech, computerized era, man must stimulate and reprogram his own computer brain to attain new heights of operation. The "Rover" dreartis have convinced me there are channels of communication, areas of awareness and states of being which farrly scream for exploration. Dream study seems to be an excellent vehicle for such investigation.

## DREAM GUIDES

LINDA RAVENWOLF

Illustration by N.J. Churchill

What are dream guides and what do they do? I describe dream guides as "those dream people or beings who seem to be aware of what's going on; they don't get caught up in the dreamer's hallucinations. They are very purposeful. They may make a statement or ask the dreamer a question; of ten, they show the dreamer something or communicate important concepts nonverbally, mind-tomind. Sometimes they simply observe the action and stay in the background. Even so, they are memorable; they stand out as being different from other dream characters. The dreamer may awaken with the feeling that he or she actually met and communicated with an independent entity."

Are dream guides of this type independent entities, or are they the dreamer's imaginative creations? I admit that experientially, I'm biased toward the former hypothesis. Many, if not most, dream characters I recognize as my own projections, but dream guides exert a sense of presence and purpose that's hard to deny. But whatever one's bias, and whatever the real nature of these guides, their help can be used to advantage.

In August I started "Project Dream Guide" to find out more about these beings, and I made a list of questions for them to answer. One of these questions was: "What is your biggest job in helping people? What do you do the most?"

My dream: "l'm flying through layers of energy. No visual images, but I do have the sensation of a human body form. I fly to where the guides are; their home territory, and meet three of them. They communicate instantaneously to me: 'Reassurance. This is the main work we do. We spend much energy reassuring people that they are not alone. Next, we reassure them that they are capable, that they have everything it takes to fulfill their lives. Loneliness--a sense of being separate-and lack of belief in their abilities are two of the major problems humans have."

My first dramatic encounter with a dream guide (that I remember) occurred in 1969 during my carefree single days in New Orleans. I dreamed of a great "inner sun" that was a being. It's hard to describe the love and intelligence of this being, and how it imparted instructions in meditation to me, but when I woke up I knew much about the subject.
The first thing I did was buy a book on meditation to learn more, and when I returned home, a roommate showed me an ad in the paper: "Meditation at the Temple of Silence." I became a student there for several years.

In 1971, in the early morning hours, I woke up in an "energy field" without any sensation of form, but no loss of identity. I was like a point in infinity. A dream guide was with me, and he asked: "Why didn't you visit Jeanne yesterday?" I made the mental equivalents of shrugging, wrinkling my nose, and frowning, and replied in a whiny

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-10.jpg?height=1776&width=1385&top_left_y=711&top_left_x=736)
things over and over. She complains, and...l just didn't feel it would be worthwhile..." Although he was totally nonjudgmental, I was appalled at the whine in my voice, and my pettiness. As spoke I realized just how "little" I'd been. The next day, at the first opportunity, I went to see Jeanne. Maybe I was overlooking something, just seeing the surface. Sure enough, it wasn't long before l'd made a friend I could talk to about things like dreams...and years later, when I was having a hard time in Alaska, she sent me a painting that helped me make it through the winter.
Now, for a fernale guide. She's a regular in my dreams, and I call her "dream mother." Alaska, 1975:

"I'm walking through a marketplace with many colorful shops. I stop to admire many items--a weaving, some pottery, embroidered clothes. Now I'm walking down a ha,। where my artwork is exhibited in a room. I look at it with excitement; I think my abstract of a ballerina is beautiful, but no one else even notices it. Why is it that I can appreciate other people's creativity, but they don't even recognize mine? I crumple up beside it and begin to sob. Dream mother comes in, and I realize

"(dream guides)...communicate important concepts nonverbally, mind-to-mind... they stand out as being different from other dream characters. The dreamer may awaken with the feeling that he or she has actually communicated with an independent entity".

Here is another example of a cream guide encounter which exposes one of their ploys--disguise (Tucson, 1973 ):

"I'm standing by my motorcycle, getting ready to take of $f$ on a ride through the desert. It's night, raining lightly, refreshing. I'm admiring my motorcycle and feeling adventurous when handsome, well-dressed man comes up hd offers to pay me for my company. No sex involved; he's just lonely. I look at him and contemplate his offer. Obviously, he has a lot of money, and I could use some; and he doesn't seem to be a bad sort. But I really don't want to spend time with him--yet the offer is attractive, and I'm somehow flattered to think that he's attracted to me. But if I took him up on it, it'd only increase his loneliness and sense of powerlessness in the long run. I shake my head gently, feeling real sympathy for him. 'No, thank you,' I say. As soon as I say this, he smiles and begins to glow with golden light. He looks very pleased. Soon, there is nothing but golden light, and wake up."

This dream was the beginning of the end of my saying "yes" when I wanted to say "no." I had often given in to other people's wishes because l'd felt sorry for them, or because I thought that I'd lose their friendship if I didn't comply. For example, two nights before this experience, l'd gotten the inspiration to make some personal "tarot" cards from my maj or dream images, and was happily drawing away with some new colored pencils when some friends had dropped by and pressured me into going to the ovies with them. l'd gone, and hated , and felt resentment all the next day. she's been following me. I expect her to console me, but instead, she scolds me: "There you go again, feeding your own failures!

I was finally beginning to understand that all I could do was be what I was, and fulfill my life in my own way, and that it didn't matter whether other people understood or not. If they did understand, and sharing happened, so much the better; but I couldn't demand understanding.

Dream mother has assisted dream doctors in operating on my left eye: "This will help you remember your dreams," she said. She once showed me a fantastic computer and told me that I'd been hired to teach people how to use it. The keyboard had symbols instead of letters, and by pressing certain keys, you could explore different times and possibilities. The wall-sized monitor projected living scenes. It was a computer that was alive and intelligent; it could even dream.

Recently an elderly couple, with all the traits of guides, took me into my grandmother's back room and showed me some fine embroidery l'd done as a child. At first, I didn't recognize it, then 1 remembered doing it. "There are some talents you were born with and began to develop, but you've forgotten about them."

It isn't beneath the dignity of a dream guide to clean the dreamer's dream tollet, or to break into tears when the dreamer doesn't get the message, and take the dreamer's face into her hands and say, "I really care about you." Sometimes a guide will rub the dreamer's nose in his shortcomings, and seem downright mean. Yet this must be with the subconscious consent of the dreamer, because l've never felt forced or pressured by any of them. Even when they use tricks, such as disguises, and seem to test me, l've always been grateful for the insights. I believe they respond to the insights we are specifically seeking. For example, when I decided that I wanted to go out-of-body from the pre-dream state, a woman came to help me lift out.

In many dream guide encounters, I experience a high degree of lucidity, with the exception of "test situations." In these, it seems that low lucidity is almost a necessity, otherwise I wouldn't take the show seriously and reveal my true colors. It's likely that l've failed some of these "tests" and taken the dream guide for an imaginative dream character.

Many dream guides remain invislta, and just impart information: "Practice sending healing energy every day. This is the only way you'll be able to do it in an emergency, when the need for hesting is acute." This information is of ten communicated instantaneously and nonverbally, and the dreamer has to put it into words. In addition, such instantaneous communications involve much more than just information; intense experience and emotion are part of the package. Even when the guide speaks in words, the real idea-experience seems to have been sent inwardly. The words are either for summary or emphasis.

"Regular" imaginative dream people do some of the things dream guides do (they ask questions, cause trouble, etc.), yet except for "test situations," aream guides stand out with their unique qualities. They are also different in their energies and presence from what may be (and I believe to be, given my bias) other out-of-body dreamers and inner communications with other "real" people.

However, I do have trouble distinguishing dream guides from personifications of my inner self. Is this because they dwell in the same "country" (birds of a feather type of thing), or because "all are one" where they come from? If we're all part of the whole, then where do dream guides end and the inner self begin? For that matter, where do I end, and where does my neighbor begin?

Whatever their familial relationships and nature, I think dream guides deserve some study. They seem to know so much about us, even more than we know about ourselves, and I think it's time to turn the tables. Furthermore, they seem to welcome curiosity. It's as if they think it's about time we realized that the universe is a very big place, and we aren't its only inhabitants.

THE BIKE RACE

I dream that my best friend and I are having a bike race. My friend is ahead but he falls off a cliff and dies. I win the race. I wake up glad to have won the race but I feel bad all day, especially when I see my friend. I'm afraid to tell him. This dream worries me a lot. I just can't stop thinking about it.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-12.jpg?height=1994&width=1424&top_left_y=473&top_left_x=602)

## SOLUTION

I drew my dream and closed my eyes to go back into it.

I said to my friend I don't want you to die but I want to win the race and it's not a fair race because you have a new bike.

My friend said his dad won't let him lend it because it's new . Winning is important, but so is having a best friend.

The best solution we found was to go to my friends father and explain what we thought was fair. He let us share the new bike and he timed the race. It was a tie.

Discussion:

How can we deal with desires that create guilty feelings?

What other ways are there to get what we want without destroying another person?

Can we practice discussing with grownups, especially other people's parents, problems like this, so it's not so scary.

Dreams allow us to act on our primal feelings but our conscience is distressed on waking to realize what we have done and welcomes a more comfortable solution.

## DREAM TAROT. <br> (C) Strephon Kaplan Williams 1986 author of the Jungian-Senoi Dreamwork Manual

In this column we will feature a classic Great Dream each issue based on the author's forthcoming book, The Dream Tarot. In working with this m.uicrial the reader can experience each dream and its issues using techniques suggested here. The Jungian-Senoi approach emphasizes actualization over interpretation, which means that we use dreamwork methodology rather than symbol systems lor gaining meaning from dreams.

## Procedure

1. Read the dream and then go into a meditalive state with your eyes closed and see the dream for yoursell. Allow or place yourself and your own dream or lile characters in the dream in place of the original characters.
2. Re-enacl the dream still in the meditative state and immediately record your insights and leelings.
3. Read the commentary here and the issues and questions. Respond to anything which is evocative for you, positive or negative.
4. Bring your experience to essence in a principle, insight or lile task for yoursell. You might also put your experience into ant or movement, or discuss it with a friend of guide. You have then made the dream your own.

THE DREAM-The Snake Hors d'oeuvre

I dreamed that I insisted on going to this cocktail party out on a terrace. My energy was high and I quickly grabbed an hors d'oeuvre from a passing waiter and put it to my mouth. I was horrified to see at the last moment that it was a pastry wilh a tiny, live snake wrapped around it. I was so disgusted that I threw it against the wall and woke up.

## COMMENT AND ISSUES

Destiny is knocking at your door but you may still be avoiding the crisis which is upor. you. What is needed for healing in this situation? This food is strong medicinc, and if it is to be eaten it must be done with consciousness rather than impulse. The food of the earth gods does not come lightly. Your life is being changed whether you like it or not. Your task may well be to accept the incvitable and to flow with it. Resistance and fear are natural to the human condition. Pcrhaps experience these fully, but then move on.

## QUESTIONS AND TASKS

- What enormity are you needing to face in your life at this time? You may be going through a severe crisis but have not yet gotten to the root of things. How can you change your attitude for the better in order to let destiny guide you? Seek competent help and communicate with friends.
- It is your task to reconcile with the snake. Why not have a written or verbal dialogue with this creature and ask it why it has come into your life right now and how you might best cope with its message? Every situation is a life and death situation if we probe deeply enough to its spiritual significance. How deeply are you willing and able to go? Focus your commitment on what is essential to the meaning of your life journey, and let the rest go.


## The Quest for the Holy Dream

Well, now, I have to confess that 38 years as a Roman Catholic weren't all for naught. l've had my share of mystical, spiritual, ethereal experiences. But outgrew the religion of my protracted youth, not too coincidentally, the same time as 1 began an intensive study of dreams. Soon I was reading of ecstatic dreams, one-witti-God dreams and universal love dreams. Goodie, thought 1 , I want one of those. Forget it, said my dream self.

Still, I have been blessed by a potpourri of dream bouquets. And, ah, yes, l've found guides to lead me over hill and dale through the vast and multilayered dream world. But they often seem no more lucid than I. And, upon waking, they bear a suspicious resemblance to some dreamworkers I know!

## Oh, nol

## My Heaven is a Stupld Bureaucracyl

Last January my quest for guidance incubated the following dream:

"Inside a building, I cross a corridor, go up to a young man and ask him for guidance. We begin walking down hallways, turning corners, and climbing stairs. Being lucid, I'm fully aware that he is 'guiding' me, all right, and this ISN'T what I mean. I start to get pissed.

Before I have a temper tantrum, we come upon two women at a counter. Next to them is an electronic gadget: a combination telephone, computer monitor, and pin-ball machine. The young man gestures for me to use it. Several men gather round to watch me.

I pick up the receiver and say, 'This is Linda Magallon. I'd llke to get some spiritual guldance.'

A woman's voice answers. 'You need to $X X X X X$ the Turbe XXXX first.' Her speech is drowned in static.

I figure I need to be a tad more specific. 'I want to meet my guide.' (That is, if l've got one, I amend mentally.)

Pause. 'I'm sorry. Would you please repeat that?'

'I want to meet my guide.'

The pause stretches like a suspended breath. I KNOW something's going to explode so I hold out the receiver.
'P-Toing!!' A powerful electronic 'ping' echoes throughout the corridor.

The men jump. 'What the hell was THAT? It must have been a disconnect? I'm convinced that whatever happened, my request has reverberated to the farthest depths of the computer system.

Behind the men, a door flings open. In the doorway stands an Oriental man. It appears he had just been working on some papers at his desk in the basement when he heard the alarm, swept the papers together into a file folder and ran upstairs. Papers are hanging out at odd angles all around the file folder. realize that it's all MY paperwork.

He tells the group that the file had been misplaced and hands the whole mess to me. I'm incensed.

'You mean to tell me that you guys MISPLACED my file?! You MISPLACED it? Is that why I haven't been able to communicate with spiritual guidance?? Oh, boy, you guys are going to hear from me! From now on my life had better be super-terrific to make up for all the crap in the first half $1^{\circ}$ I turn and stomp upstairs."

Oh, Lord, l'll never make it to sainthood at this rate. I've never found a metaphysical system that places top value on temper tantrums. But they sure can clear the air.

If This is Hell. Where's the Marshmallows?

Almost six months to the day after the first dream, 1 had its complement:

"I become lucid standing with a dark man in an institutional kitchen. We're watching a young blonde man spoon food on to plates. Other young people are hurrying back and forth through the aisles. Beyond them is a doorway, the top edge of which is glowing an orange-pink. This seems to the entryway to a place of extreme heat and reminds me of hellfire. Hellfire? What a unique opportunity!

Enthusiastically I tell my companion, 'I think I'll go to hell!' I want to see if I can stand the fear associated with the place.

Immediately, the scene repeats itself, without my companion in evidence. This time I'm one of the sweating drudges slinging hash in the steamy kitchen. Tendrils of hair droop down my forehead. They resist being moved by a puff of breath, or swipe of arm to my brow.

Then l've become aware that I needn't do that kind of labor and have gone on to the next scene. Now I have a glob of red shoe polish in my hand, ready for application. But instead I slop it all over my long red paisley peasant dress. What a mess!

I walk away from this scenario down a long, slanted hallway. Three women are standing in the middle, talking together in polite disagreement. One proposes her own definition of 'theology.' Then the second provides her own 'true' version. Literal nit-pickers. I go on past them looking for someone I can talk to.

'I want to have a conversation with a lucid dreamer!' I call out, then qualify the request with, 'one who's lucid now!' Briefly I consider spinning to 'go' to meet such an individual, but before I do, I enter a room with several people. A couple of men come over to talk. 'Hello, I'm Linda Magallon. What's your name?' I ask first.

He bends down to whisper into my ear. I can't distinguish a word he's saying. I go on to the next eager talker who turns and walks with me the length of the room. He's speaking profusely all right--in a foreign language 1 can't understand. I turn left and go toward a door looking for a way to the colorful inferno.

Suddenly, 1 find myself seated in the lap and within the encircling arms of a warm figure. I am describing the frustration l've felt walking around in circles in the previous portions of my dream. Then the truth hits me, 'This is MY hell, Isn't it?' I crack up.

Across the way is seated a verbose, curly blonde haired woman. She begins a rapid-fire interpretation of each scene of my Jream. 'But it's my helll' I protest. She continues on, unabated.

Maybe I should listen to her opinions? No, she hasn't gotten my point, yet. I interject a second time.

Still she blabbers on. I interrupt once again. 'This is MY hell--I created it!' I awake, grinning."

I think the God of Linda has a funny bone. Somehow, that thought is "wholly comforting."

## A Lucid Dream Incubation Technique

Throughout recorded history man has used dreams as an oracle, as a means of gaining information from the unconscious mind nct easily obtainable elsewhere. In recent years numerous writers in the dreamwork field have described methods for programming dreams on predecided topics. Usually thes s' incubation techniques involve some sort of affirmation before sleep as to the information desired, with an analysis and recording of the following night's dreams the next morning.

In general, incubation methods using ordinary dreams suffer from a number of unavoidable shortcomings. First, very few of us can recall all of the dreams that we have on a given night even under the best of conditions. Thus, you might succeed in incubating a dream and yet fail to recall it! Second, you might erroneously choose a dream as the answer to your incubation simply because you did recall it. Third, dream recall itself often seems fragmentary, which opens the possibility that you might not include crucial dream events or symbols in the morning after interpretation of the dreams you recall. Even in the ideal case where you do recall all of your dreams completely on a given night, how do you correctly decide which dream (or dreams) deals with the incubated topic? And finally, once you have chosen a dream as the incubated dream, you have the not exactly trivial problem of translating a series of multiordinal dream symbols into some sort of a definitive answer. Personal bias and simple confusion, given the usual complexity of dream symbology, makes at least some interpretive errors in the analysis of an incubated dream almost unavoidable. Thus, it should hardly surprise anyone that even after a successful dream incubation, one can still end up with considerable doubt as to the actual meaning of an incubated dream, and of the best way of acting on the information so acquired.

Although the incubation of ordinary dreams can result in a profound experience of considerable psychological impact, the meaning of the incubated dream itself often seems far less than definitive in any practically useful sense. This can result in a fair degree of frustration and dissatisfaction with the more ordinary dream incubation methods. How delightful it would seem to sometimes obtain a simple YES or NO as the answer to a dream incubation topic question such as "Should I take the new job offer?", instead of receiving a Salvidore Dali dream scenario whose

meaning you can only guess at! Ideally, I think most of us would appreciate (when appropriate) simple, easily understandable answers as a result of dream incubation techniques. Unfortunately, incubation methods involving ordinary dreams rarely achieve such a result.

The lucid dream state (which I define here as the dream state where one has the same degree of consciousness and free will as in the physical reality wakıng bowl, or a closed drawer) asking the question, waiting a few seconds, and then reading the materialized answer (after turning over the bowl, or opening the drawer, etc). I have found it most important to pick an appropriate medium in each dream for the LDIT, as in my experience some mediums work far better than others. One lucid dreamer to whom l've taught this technique has gotten good results by simply asking the other

"Throughout recorded history man has used dreams as an oracte, as a means of gaining information from the unconscious mind not easily obtainable elsewhere."

state) offers a number of advantages to the ordinary dream state for dream incubation. In a lucid dream in May of 1985 I finalized a Lucid Dream Incubation Technique (LDIT) that has worked quite well for myself, as well as for others, in obtaining clear and easily understandable information on a variety of topics.

"In a lucid dream I demonstrate an incubation technique using a silver bowl to a group of other dreamers. Basically the technique consisted of the following First the lucid dreamer decides on a question, in which he or she asks for the information most needed at the present time. After deciding on a specific question, the dreamer inverts the silver bowl and consciously focuses on the question. After waiting a few seconds for the answer to materialize, the dreamer then turns over the bowl to find a materialized note with the answer written on it. I took a number of my fellow dreamers through this incubation technique, and each received a clear and discrete answer. For myself I asked for a message from an of ficial in a government agency about the possibilities of future research grants, and received the answer "Goodbye!", which I clearly understood meant that I would receive no further funding from this agency [note: which incidentally, has proved quite truel In cases where my dream students didn't understand the answer, I told them to get the meaning from their own unconscious that materialized the answer, and not to ask me!"

Since that time I have experimented with variations on this LDIT. The essential principle behind this technique involves first finding a medium for the materialization of the answer (such as a characters in his dreams for the information he requires! The best mediums give you discrete, specific answers, easily remembered in the transition from the lucid dream state to the physical reality waking state.

The LDIT has proved itself amenable to getting information on any topic which can have an answer consisting of a few words or a simple diagram or object. One could ask for example for solutions to health problems, investment advice, etc., etc. As an oracle of one's unconscious information, it has no equal in my experience, and I have found the information so received of a very high quality. This does not mean that I always get usable answers to the questions I ask! In one case, where I had requested investment information, I got my answer on a clay tablet in what looked like cuneiforml

Despite its utility, the Lucid Dream Incubation Technique has one considerable disadvantage as compared to ordinary dream incubation methods, in that it requires that the dreamer maintain a clearheaded lucidity in the dream state. Within the dream, one must decide on, or clearly remember, an incubation question, find a usable medium for providing the answer, consclously focus on the question, and then consclously retain and clearly recall the answer on returning to the physical reality waking state. Obviously, the LDIT may only find practical use among experienced lucid dreamers. Despite this disadvantage, I recommend the LDIT highly, and I hope that any dreamers who make the required effort to give it a try will meet with success!

## Following My Dreams With The Edgar Cayce Readings

RACHE KENDAL

In this article, 1 will present an overview of Following my dreams with the Edgar Cayce readings. I wrote this book to share with others the experiences of how 1 interpreted the symbolism in my dreams and became a psychic healer. In this book, I guide the reader through seventy of my dreams and help him learn to interpret his own dreams.

In September 1979, I attended a dream seminar at the Association for Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach, Virginia. At that time, I wasn't specifically interested in dreams, but l'd been an A.R.E. member for twelve years and enjoyed being at Headquarters with other members. My daughter, Debbie, also a member, met me there so we could have a vacation together at the beach.

The first night I was there I went to bed at eleven o'clock and awoke, startled at 1 AM. I'd just dreamed: "I'm walking on the beach. I see several people in a group. Someone says: Somebody just died on the beach."

Thinking that was nothing to record, I went back to sleep. I had the same dream and awoke a half hour later. I ignored that one also. After having the same dream three times within two hours, I decided to record it. I reported the dream to our class the next morning and after much discussion the interpretation was: My old consciousness had died and
I was going to have a new consciousness. I didn't give it much thought except to hope that l'd have more interesting dreams.

The following night, I did have an interesting dream which I was unable to interpret at the time. This is the dream: "I'm at A.R.E. Headquarters, standing at the top of the library steps. I walk to a nearby office, go in, and meet Edgar Cayce. He shows me around the room, pointing to records of the readings that predict a young girl about to be graduated from high school will work for the A.R.E. Later, I'm sitting in a living room in another city with a young girl telling her about the prediction. She says she already knows because that Edgar Cayce told her, also. She's showing me some pictures of vegetables and I say, 'I don't like asparagus.' She shows me a picture of a snake and I jump up on a chair and say, 'I don't like snakes, either.' She laughs and I begin to cry. I feel a great burden of responsibility for her. I also feel humble because I was entrusted with this responsibility."

Due to the many changes in my life during the following year, I interpreted the dream thus: I'm at a stage of higher (top of steps) learning (library). I'm seeking information from an authoritative figure (Edgar Cayce). I desire to work for A.R.E. but I'm not ready. The young girl about to be graduated from high school is one aspect of myself which ref lects immaturity at my conscious level. I'm not consciously aware of my potential pertaining to healing. The pictures of the asparagus (asp: a snake) and the snake are allusions to the kundalini activities that are taking place in my physical body. The creative force that is raised through the endocrine glands - or spiritual centers - is called the kundalini. The spiraling motion of the current suggests a serpent, which in turn symbolizes creative force: the healing energy which emanates from the hands of a person who is a channel for healing.

During the week of the seminar I went to see a psychic reader who told me I was a channel for healing. I refused to believe her because I didn't want to get involved in anything weird. I became extremely annoyed with her lecture on how I should accept the responsibility of using this "gift" to help others. I told Debbie what the reader had said and we decided to ignore it because it was too puzzling for us to comprehend.

With the help of Dreams: Your magic mirror, by Elsie Sechrist, I continued to study my dreams. Two months later, I had this dream:

"I'm climbing up through the bomb

(Continued on next page)

(Continued from previous page)

baby doors of a World War II bomber with others. We are leaving everything behind and taking off on an unknown mission. We have dishes of food. We know people will wonder about our disappearance. We're wearing combat gear and facing each other as the plane takes of $f$. A preschooler is sitting beside me."

In Awakening the dreamer, by Mark Thurston, there is a "five step" approach to dream interpretation. This is the method I used to categorize each portion of my dream.

Step I) Clarifying the Feelings in the Dream: I felt confident and determined about my mission.

Step 2) Extracting the Theme of the Dream: A group of people are going on a mission.

Step 3) Associating to the Dream Symbols: I used Dreams: Your magic mirror for help in interpreting the dream symbols. All of the symbols must be studied in relation to the likes and dislikes of the dreamer. Others may of fer ideas for interpretation, but only the dreamer can determine the exact meaning of his dream symbols. I interpreted the symbols in my dream as follows. Climbing:.going upward. World War 11 bomber: a reliable means of conveyance. Others in dream: helpers, co-workers. Leaving everything behind: willing to sacrifice. Dishes of food: spiritual preparedness. Combat gear: readiness Facing each other: facing a situation. Preschooler: childhood, growth and development, changes.

Step 4) Arriving at a Preliminary Understanding, a "working hypothesis" subject to revision. In applying this dream to a current life concern, my preliminary understanding is that 1 'm climbing upward in my endeavors. I have a reliable means of conveyance (my faith in God) and others are helping me. I'm willing to sacrifice to carry out my mission. I'm prepared and on my way. I'm facing the situation. There will be changes and growth involved in this mission.

Step 5) Devising a Strategy for Applying the Dream. In order for the dreamer to go beyond his preliminary understanding, he must apply the dream to his basic beliefs about himself, and to the current events in his life. It takes time and effort to interpret one's dreams. One must let his mind wander over many possible explanations for his feelings about himself and his attitudes toward dream symbols. Conflicts within one's self can create confusion when attempting to interpret dreams. The self-analysis must be honest and without self-condemnation to reach a basic viewpoint to work with.
The foremost thought in my mind is to have a closer walk with Jesus and to help others do likewise. The Edgar Cayce readings have helped me along the way in my spiritual quest. As a contact person for A.R.E., I engage in discussions almost daily with people of like-minds. Involvement with A.R.E. takes more of my time than any other area of my life; consequently, most of my dreams deal with spiritual matters.

So, in applying the dream to my current life situation, I interpret it to mean that I'm climbing upward in my endeavor to be closer to Jesus. My reliable means of conveyance are my faith in God, the A.R.E., and my study group. 1 put my mission foremost and sacrifice other aspects of my life in reaching for my goal. I'm looking forward to growing and changing.

l've just written a simplistic interpretation of the dream of a forty-nine-year-old woman who spent a lifetime building an individual psyche to the extent that it would produce such a dream. Each of us builds his own repertoire in his psyche as he goes through life. This is what we draw from when dreaming and interpreting our dreams.

For example, in 1944, when I was a teenager in Detroit, Michigan, I attended an air show where I boarded a World War Il bomber. The events of the day and the planes that I investigated evoked mission-minded and patriotic feelings. These feelings, along with the visual effects, were stored in my subconscious. My super-conscious (conscience, higher self, soul) retrieved these memories from my subconscious and presented them as symbols in a dream to impress my conscious mind. My conscious mind guided my thinking and physical activity to record the dream upon awakening. As I interpreted the dream I relived the mission-mindedness that $\mathrm{I}$ felt thiryt-five years previously at the air show. These were altruistic feelings which I value. These feelings were chameled into action in working with other A.R.E. members to establish an Edgar Cayce study group through which we hoped to help others in their search for God.

Not all of the memories in my subconscious mind are pleasant. Sometimes the unpleasant ones are in my dreams to let me know that my thinking and behavior are not as they should be. However, I try to use my mistakes as stepping-stones, and avoid programming hurtful events into my psyche. I find that trying to live by the Golden Rule "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." - will build up a good storehouse of memories.

PREDICTING WEATHER FROM DREAMSP

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_05_1b95c1b20607b6e4a756g-19.jpg?height=751&width=580&top_left_y=199&top_left_x=187)

DNB has received a steady stream of letters from Ray DiPietro, a plumber, who claims that he can predict the weather 14 days in advance from his dreams. Here is the account written about Ray by Dick Case in the June 4, 1986 suburban edition of The Syracuse Herald-Journal appearing under the following headline:

## When Ray DIPietro Dreams of Water, Better Wear Your Galoshes

According to Ray DiPietro, when the dreams about water, someone is getting wet. This may be in Minoa, where Ray lives, or in the Republic of Rwanda.

The first thing to understand here is that Ray is not a meteorologist, although it turns out he is a student of weather. Ray is the proprietor of a small business called DiPietro Energy Efficient Systems. He started out being a plumber. His biographer some day will want to explore this fascinating transition: dripping faucets to dreams in which water is the principal player.

Philosophy came late to my friend. So did an interest in matters that do not always yield to immediate explanation. One of these is parapsychology. Ray says he is sensitive. He means he is a receiver of impulses from places outside of his own head.

For some reason - Ray still searches for an explanation - this middle-aged grandfather receives weather forecasts disguised as dreams about water. This has been going on about 15 years, according to Ray.

Let me try to explain by example. Here is part of a letter I got from Ray in February:

"Dream One: Florence (Ray's wife) and I were looking at a camp (we wanted to buy) on a small river. It was bright and sunny and campers on both sides of the water were fishing and cooking out. Everything was very pretty. We decided not to buy because the camp was only one foot above the water level in the river. We said if a heavy storm hit, it would wipe out the camp."

Ray had two dreams that night. These events, he said, are like sitting and watching a TV show in which he is the main character.

"Dream Two: I drove my truck up to a very large quarry. It had hundreds of man-made and natural water falls. The man-made ones were of different colored stones with some very odd shapes. As the water fell over them it carved and smoothed the stones and rocks... This was an incredibly beautiful place. Walking around I did get wet from the spray. I slipped and almost fell on the wet stones."

The night left a prediction in Ray's dream book: "Starting today and for the next 3 days, a storm. A new storm on $3 / 6$ to $3 / 8 "$ opher

So it goes with the plumber-philos-

Early on, Ray kept his dreams to himself. He said he decided to share them with others after his records showed certain patterns. One definite pattern was that 12 to 14 days after a dream involving water, there would be a storm of some sort. Ray watched the newspapers and saw what happened. Once in a while, there were earthquakes and other natural disasters at the other end of the cycle.

The dreams kept coming and after a while, Ray started sending postcards to some of his friends. They are dated so that the predictions could be checked. One card went to the Communications Studies Laboratory at Syracuse University. The staff at the lab looks into paranormal events. Ray's dream cards have been going to SU since 1972.

According to Ray, who has kept track, his weather prediction accuracy rate is 80 percent.

I've been getting the cards since the first of the year. Ray's two-week wet span holds up well, if you accept his notion that a storm recorded anywhere in the world is a score for Ray. Of course, there will be people who want more particular information from the dreamer. Such as, exactly where the big rains will hit. South Clinton Street or Liechtenstein?

"I write down what I see in the dream," Ray explained. "If the dream wasn't particular, I can't be particular. I dream in symbols. I write down what l've seen."

For instance, if Ray sees himself in water - sometimes lapping at his knees, sometimes at his chin - he knows someone is in for a dunking. Remember the terrible floods we had in 1972? According to Ray, "every night for two weeks, I dreamed I was in water."

A recent card of Ray's was mailed May 3. It described his dream of May 2: "Last night, all of my dreams were vivid, lucid, very, very real. (Ray admitted to me that some of his oreams are weak specimens and not much help in the way of making a prediction.) In one dream, I dove over a cliff 100 to 200 feet high. The cliff was part of a cove that was $\mathrm{C}$-shaped. There was a small island in the center, near where I landed. The flight down was like a bird in flight.

"I penetrated about a foot or two in the water."

Ray takes this seriously. He is pleased with his arrangement with SU but he would like to expand the sources of information.

"I know there are others out there who have the same experiences I do," he said. "I would like to be able to get together with them and share our dreams. Wouldn't it be nice to have a central place to call? Maybe a number people could call and have their predictions recorded."

Meanwhile, Ray said he dreamed the water we found falling on us last weekend a fortnight before it fell. And Monday night, when he closed his eyes, he was back in that place with all of the waterfalls. Twelve days from Monday that will be June 14 - expect a storm carrying water. Ray feels it will pass to the north or south of Syracuse.

(Editor's note: In a brief piece in the same newspaper on July 23, Dick Case wrote a follow-up):

Credit has to be given. My friend Ray DiPietro, whose dreams of water 1 wrote about June 4, was right-on last week's wind storms.

This is what he wrote me about a weather dream on a post card dated June 24: "I was in a house surrounded by large willows. A tree came through the roof just as I left the room. The winds were twisting the trees in all directions." Storm date: July 13 to 15.

The tornado went through the Fulton-Baldwinsville rectangle July 13.

In a follow-up note, Ray said his prediction was made the same day tropical storm Bonnie was born in the gulf. He noted that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were recorded in the same July period.

(Ray would like to correspond with others about these dreams and obtain help in learning how to better utilize them. He would also appreciate help in documenting and writing about his experiences. His address: 205 S. Central Avenue, Minoa, NY 13116.)

Dreaming: It's very nicel

When it's 13 o'clock

And the ceiling is on the floor

And there's a duck in your kitchen

And your moon cactus is walking

You know dreaming

Dreaming's very nice

In the magical world of dreaming

You know what

And I'm dreaming

You're dreaming, too.

## Media Coverage of DNB

I was pleased to read in your last editorlal that reporters are beginning to call, and we are beginning to recelve some national recognition. Maybe you could let us know which publications are doing copy so that we could begin to follow our progress. (Incidentally, I am consciously using the pronouns we and our, as part of the specialness of D.N.B. is that 1 really do feel a part of its network.)

I'm delighted that we are receiving some attention. It continues to confound me that while Freud's seminal work is The Interpretation of Dreams, dreams are still looked at askance by the psychological community and the public in general. It's time for a change in attitudes and acceptance.

Charlotte Bell, Rt. 3, Box II9I, Weare, $\mathrm{NH} 03281$

(Editor's note: See Charlotte's article in this issue. With regard to her question, the latest coverage has been in Saturday Review, September, 1986 and before that, the summer issue of Spectator Magazine, for GM car owners. Each has involved a synchronicity. On the cover of the latter was the word, "Sundance" in a neon light, recalling the origins of DNB, and in the former, there was a review of a book on SHOE trivia, as if to further our project on "Shoes of a Dreamer.")

## Dream of my DNB Subscription

This morning I woke with the following dream:

I am in a country setting. I enter a shop that is closed for the day. I see a copy of the DNB. I recall that my subscription has expired and I did not get this particular issue. I look through the new July issue and see that it is wonderfully illustrated in art and pictures. I arrange to have four back issues sent to me.

As we depart I realize that I have a valuable book belonging to the store in my hands. I go back to return it.

As we are walking a male approaches. He tries to slip eggs into my pockets. I try to block him and put the eggs back in his pockets. This interchange intensifies and 1 finally throw one toward his breast pocket. I miss and it goes in at his open collar where it breaks.

We are trying to find our way through the campus.

DAY RESIDUE: I had just responded to a notice that my news magazine subscription had expired. it was the second notice. I obediently wrote a check and put it in an envelope to be mailed.

I have been making choices about where to spend my tight resources. That The dream pointed me to my priorities. I do not have to respond to the pressure of the news magazine. I can cancel that subscription in favor of the more important part of my life--dreams.

ACTION: Enclosed is my check for the DNB. Please place me back in sequence by sending me the July/August issue.

## Shoes in My Dreams

Several month ago shoes were recurring as a symbol in my dreams. did some symbol amplification and found that they had two separate and distinct meanings for me. Firstly, they symbolized clutter. I rarely throw out old pairs, so they piled up unused. My dream application involved getting the clutter out of my life, literally and figuratively.

Secondly, I found they could represent a life direction as in, "I wouldn't want to be in his shoes." I applied this by going out and buying a pair of new expensive shoes. They would be a waking symbol for my new life direction vocationally. I'm usually less than satisfied with my shoe purchases after I have had them for a week. So, I made it a point to buy the perfect pair that would not later disappoint.

Jay Jerrel, Terrell Productions, Inc. 11003 Allegheny Street, Sun Valley, CA 91352

I've had shoe dreams ever since I can remember. They mean "earth life" to me--my contact with physical reality and my life style.

Often, when I begin expressing new parts of myself, I dream about shoes. Flamenco shoes are emotional expression, and usually appear when I'm not expressing my emotions--or when I am expressing them in a creative way. The first kind of dream points out to me what I'm not, but should, be doing, and the second kind is just a celebration.

When I dream of looking for a job (this happens when I feel financially insecure), I often dream of shopping for shoes. Usually 1 can't find the right pair.

When we were living in Alaska, 1 wondered what it would be like to move back to Tucson. I dreamed that I found a pile of old shoes under a spruce tree. These were shoes I used to wear when we lived in Tucson. I tried them on, but they weren't the right size.

Linda Ravenwolf, 704 N. Verdugo Rd., Glendale, CA 91206.

I have had several shoe dreams through the years. Generally, I think shoes represent grounding, or the lack of it, for me. Going barefoot can mean either freedom (barefoot in the sand), or that I am inadequately prepared (barefoot on broken glass or ice.) Dancing shoes represent freedom, balance, exquisite movement (everything positive.)

I was unprepared for what I found looking at my shoe dreams--what I found surprised me. Shoes also seem to epresent sexuality for me! During a period when I was re-establishing myself as a sexual person and separating my sexual identity as my own and not as "in the image of my mother," my shoe dreams also involved sexual themes. Rereading these shoe dreams was very revealing for me.

## Woody Allen's Hellcopter

5th August 1976 I had a dream where a bicycle-based, pedal-powered helicopter was rescued from a lake. Then it was on the ground outside our home. As a man from the Air Force watched, my older brother pedaled it carefully and made it fly. This situation was very comical. This dream was only a funny curiosity among hundreds of dreams I was recording.

Then in the fall of 1982,1 was watching a TV-program about movies. In a half interested way, I was observing an expert showing short cuts and giving personal comments. And then suddenly: THE SAME BICYCLE-HELICOPTER WAS THERE! A kind of de ja vu feeling came tho my mind when I saw this Woody Allen contraption. I checked my computer files and there was my bicycle-helicopter dream!

If I ever meet Mr. Allen (not so likely) I would like to ask when and how he got the idea about the bicycle-helicopter?

The name of the film was probably (I didn't write it down!) the Sleeper. I wonder if anybody who reads DNB could tell more about Woody's or other movie makers, like Fellini's, dream inspired productions.

One aspect that this dream inspired me to think about was a kind of Dream Coincidence Library. Is it possible to create a DCL organization that helps people contact the "idea partner of the real world?" DCL could develop computer routines to locate such matches more easily. In this case 1 could contact Woody Allen and ask about this helicopter. The point is that an individual can't go around asking "foolish" questions, but an organization might be able to channel such inquires e.g. maybe $\mathrm{Mr}$. Allen already had 3 inquiries in the database when my question came in? It may be worth an experiment.

## Henry Reed's DREAM JOURNAL MORE ON SHOES

## Shoe Synchronicities

When synchronicities--those intriguing coincidences that seem so meaningful--appear during a dreamwork quest, you know you are treading upon the path of buried riches waiting to be discovered. It would seem that our "Shoes of the Dreamer" project is something of this nature. Since the last issue, two interesting shoe-incidences have occurred.

First, the same issue of Saturday Review (September, 1986) that carried the piece on DNB also contained a review of a book on shoe trivia and the history of shoes, called, Shoe Time. We've ordered a copy of that book to help us with the project. Judging from the review of this timely (for us) book it seems clear that we all have many emotional connections with shoes, making them a natural symbol for our dreams.

Second, we received a letter from a new subscriber, Mitchell Boss, a furniture designer in Pilot Mountain, NC, whose first issue of DNB contained our shoe material. It turns out that Mitchell had just published a "letter to the editor" in the Winston-Salem Journal, using shoes as the metaphor for his belief that it is a mistake to insist that only one's own "standpoint" could possibly be correct.

## Stepping Out in New Shoes

In the Letters section of this issue, on page 20, we've included under the heading, "Shoes in my Dreams," three accounts by dreamers who have attempted to understand when shoe dreams appear. What seems to be in common among these three stories is that a time of transition may a time to reconsider our shoes. We have noted earlier that preparation seems to be an activity that suggests paying attention to shoes.

Transitions are something we like to prepare for. Whether it involves examining our "standpoint," our "understanding," or some other aspect of our adaptation to the world, or perhaps even trying on another style of adaptation, it would seem that when it comes time to "step out" in a new direction is when shoe dreams appear. You might check your own dream journal and see if your experience bears out this tentative hypothesis.
Shoe Sleuthing
Here's how we are going about finding out, with your help, the possible meanings of shoes in dreams: First, we are examining all that we know about shoes. More specifically, to get at their meaning, we are looking at the ways in which "shoes" have been used in speech by collecting sayings that use the word.

Secondly, we have been asking people what shoes mean to them. The subscribers has been that shoes represent "understanding," or "standpoint." I'm hoping that our research may be able to add something to these defintions. One might ask, for example, when does an "understanding" serve as a "standpoint" when it comes to adapting to a situation?

A related approach has been to check out all the dictionaries and symt al encyclopedias to see what history has been recorded there. Similarly, we are looking at how shoes have figured in literature, such as in fairy tales and myths.

Lastly, but most interestingly, we are looking at many dreams involving shoes, to see when they appear, how they behave, and what people do with shoes in their dreams. Now although we have received from subscribers sufficient background information on shoes (sayings, fairy tales, dictionary defintions) to compile or report, we still need more dreams where shoes appearl

Here's why: We have already most common answer supplied by our reported on the major shoe themes that have appeared in the dreams sent in by subscribers so far. By and large, the kinds of situations people get into with shoes in their dreams seem to parallel shoe situations for waking life--losing shoes, trying on shoes, finding problems noted in the dreams we have seen is the case of the special hybrid shoe or shoe with magical powers. Interestingly enough, the specially talented shoe is the most common theme we see when shoes appear in fairy tales. What shoes are, as vehicles of understanding or as containers of energy, may depend upon the dream context. It's important to gather a large enough sample of shoe dreams to be able to draw some conclusions about the significance of shoes in the dreams. So let's look for those shoes!

## Loose Ends

Who is the dreamer who sent in several shoe dreams, such as "Winte Swimming," "Holes in my Feet," ano of transcribing your material onto computer. I would like to be able to write to you and to give you credit on your DNB subscription, as I have done for everyone else who has contributed to this project. Please identify yourself!

Also, I have a some material from a Deborah Waser, with no address provided. I'd like to hear from Deborah, also. with shoes, etc. The only exception "Nazis take my Boots"? Somehow I lost your name and address during the process
