# A NEWSLETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO DARE TO DREAM 

Here is a salty, wise, creative, confrontive and yet gentle dreamworker by the name of Ann Wiseman. Raised in New York City, she has lived in Europe and California, and now resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ann is an artist, lecturer, mother, workshop leader and author of twelve books. Having participated in her dream workshops on two occasions, I know her to be a powerhouse dreamworker.
Jill: Ann, tell me, what led you to become a dreamworker?

Ann: My interest in dreams, really, comes from the fact that I did not follow their wisdom. I had many important dreams and was interested in my dreams but there was nothing in my community, family, or schooling that made me think that dreams were something to pursue. Seeing my dreams guide me differently than what I chose to do and then seeing how things subsequently worked out in my life got me thinking, "Gee, maybe I should listen to this voice." Later, when I was training in Psychotherapy, Gestalt,

Psychodrama, Transactional Analysis and Psychosynthesis, I kept seeing that the real inner guidance voice was coming through the dream.

Dream Network Bulletin (c) 1987

DREAM NETWORK BULLETIN 1083 Harvest Meadow Court San Jose, CA 95136

Years ago, when I first began working with dreams, the idea that all parts of the dream are parts of the dreamer was introduced to me. After an exposure to many other approaches, this approach has become the one I predominantly rely upon.

While I have found that dreams are often prophetic and that they frequently comment on the world outside the dreamer, those same dreams are also usually symbolic statements about the dreamer's internal state.

After a number of moving dreams that furned out to be prophetic, I had one which seemed to predict an earthquake ( $\mathrm{I}$ lived in California at the time). Nonetheless, I worked on the dream as a statement about myself internally and it proved to be a very powerful tool that indeed did shake me up. When a minor quake did occur three days later (my prophecies are always three days early) I felt that I had done my part to abate its sway.

Others with whom I have worked on dreams have also come to the conclusion that what is within is also without. Perhaps vice-versa is true too.

As this is a concept which could be examined metaphysically, theoretically and scientifically, $I$ am perplexed that it has not been raised by this Bulletin or ASD's newsletter. As the concept certainly deserves some debate, I thought I would bring it to your attention.

Thank you for your great generosity in sending us all these issues of your Bulletin. My students and $I$ are all fascinated by what we've read and many of us have started keeping dream journals as a result. We hesitate to undertake more indepth exploration of our dreams without guidance, and I wonder if you know of anyone who might be willing to correspond with us and offer advice to a group of absolute novices. Whether or not this is possible, I would like to offer all our best wishes for the continued success of the Dream Network Bulletin. I can't recall ever having been so struck by the sincerity and idealism of any publication. You are obviously doing a great job of providing a real service to the community of dreamers.

Again, thank you; again, bravo!

New Year's Day, 1987 started

for me with some sort of "flu":

headache, sore throat and aching body. Although I'm not usually able to "sleep off" an illness, this time I probably slept 21 hours out of 24. The few hours I was out of bed were mainly spent dozing on the couch. During this time my dreams were filled with people coming to me to solve their problems. I found this amusing, feeling as I did, so I decided to go back to bed and hope for a deeper sleep.

Ordinarily | "drift off" to sleep or go "down into" sleep and dreaming. During this 21 hour period I felt as though I was leaving my physical body through the side of the body and flowing in a horizontal movement toward a place of dreaming. It felt as though "I" was flat, yet fluid, and could just "slip out." I would be asleep, then fully awake, if my husband spoke to $\mathrm{me}$, and lucid during my awake periods. Then, back into the "slipping out" feeling again.
I was usually going toward a picture of some kind. The "pictures" were similar to magazine illustrations drawn in muted colors. Once I saw a man's smiling face; another time a lake with the moon shining on it and trees around the lake. These "pictures" represented happiness and I moved toward them eagerly.

Sometimes I left my physical body through the left side, but usually I "fibwed" to the right. The physical discomforts generated by the "flu" seemed to be an entity I was leaving behind.

During my awake periods I was mentally clear and did not have a fever that might explain this.

I wonder if your readers may have experienced anything similar. Perhaps this is a common occurrence? I would appreciate any information or comments.

I'm very interested in dreams since my name, "Olan," comes from one my father had a little bit before I was born. I spelled the name out for him and had a white cow following me and a white bird on my shoulder. I said I was from Norway and showed him a map of where I lived. I was about 17 [in the dream]. Now 13, I'm waiting to see if I look anything like what I did in the dream.

Energy contained within the framework of a nightmare, when released, can be devastating.

Years ago a fierce battle raged, total chaos reigned. The Germans were about to overrun our position. Furious hand to hand combat was in progress. Out of the comer of my eye I saw a German, arms outstretched, lunge towards me. I wheeled about and threw a hard right punch that
landed flush upon the mouth of my wife of three days. My shouting and thrashing about had awakened her. She had leaned over and was gently attempting to awaken me.

After a few days her swollen lips and threats of divorce subsided. Another week passed before I was able to convince her it was safe to sleep with me.

This incident was not humorous at the time it occurred but remembering brings a flood of fond memories laced with chuckles.

Five years later we divorced. She remained single for about 17 years. Shortly before her death in 1972 she married a German (then a citizen of the U.S.A.) who had served with the Wehrmacht.

If there is a moral to this story it is this: if you are sleeping with your husband or wife and they are experiencing a nightmare, get out of bed. Grab them by the foot, keeping in mind the other can be deadly, and give a hard yank.

I'm writing in reponse to your "Creative Dream Record" in the latest DNB. I read it and made a note to myself to write and tell you about my computer dream index. I also was very intrigued by your idea of using National Geographics to illustrate your dream joumal, and I was wishing / had some, because I find them very evocative, too. That night at my A.R.E. study group, one of the men asked if anyone wanted a bunch of National Geographics he was going to get rid of! Ah, it's all so synchronistic! Needless to say, I now have a large pile of them.

So about the dream index: about 6 months ago, I started recording my dreams on tape in the morning, because I found that I could recall more, not having to wake up as much to talk as to write. When I got my computer about 5 months ago, 1 transcribed all the dreams, and while I was at it, I decided to index the symbols. When I finished those, I decided to keep on going and index all the dreams l've recorded since I started working with my dreams in 1973. Working backwards, 've now done through 1982, and I expect 'III have them all done in a few weeks. Now I can see all the dreams l've had about shoes and computers (communication with Henry Reed and Raymond Barglow coming up). Doing this has also revealed previously unknown patterns of symbols in my dreams that are very illuminating-one more way of knowing myself by working with my dreams.

## A LETTER FROM CHRIS HUDSON

Inspired by a series of "baby" dreams, Chris Hudson took over the editorship of Dream Network Bulletin in March of 1984. He published DNB until June 1985, with his wife, Dale, serving as illustrator. This past year the two of them had theirfirst child, Blake-the son predicted so long before...

Dear Linda,

I enjoyed the new.DNB. Professional look and good reading! I know you'll do a great job with it and it will grow a huge readership. There are a million people out there, it's just somehow a matter of themfinding out about it. I had that feeling when I was publishing DNB but my intuition said l'd better get ready for $m y$ son (whose conception was still at least one year in the fulure). Now as he sleeps upstairs, a wild and loveable six months old, there's no doubt about my priorities; he's a full time job.

Athough I'm not in a regular dream group now, dreams are crucial to my marriage and new role as a parent. Dale and I share dreams at every opportunity and also with friends and family who dony find it too weird. In fact, I have a brief True Llfe Story for you:

Dale and I were in Los Angeles this past summer for six weeks where she was painting for a feature film due out this spring called "Surrender," a comedy about a painter. She was six and a half months pregnant. When we finally got home September 21 st, she had a dream that she had an infant who was shaving because he had facial hair, and was sitting up; an older baby. We decided the dream meant our baby was more mature (fully mature, in fact) than his exact gestational age of 36 weeks. We were certain of her date of conception.

The next day she showed some discharge that looked like amniotic fluid. I hauled her to the midwife. They assured us it wasn't. Nevertheless, the next day, a scant three days after returning home, she went into serious labor. Since she was only $361 / 2$ weeks pregnant and the midwives require at least 37 weeks for home delivery, they were hesitant to do a nonhospital birth with us. I convinced them otherwise with our dream and a written statement releasing them from responsibility. Blake was born 17 hours later, at home without complications, a full term, seven pound, two ounce tyke.

Almost every dream / had dreamt about a son in the several years previously turned out to have some precognitive element. I knew there would be disapproval of our home-birth decision by family and friends but that Blake would benefit by it. I knew he would be a boy. I knew my relationship to him would open up the gates to my unconscious life and many other practical concerns about health and attitude.

More than ever now, I believe that the Unconscious is God, and that dreams are an unfettered expression of a mysterious communication that is personal as well as universal. Traditional social structures based on external, rational forces have begun to deteriorate. Religions such as Catholicism that rely on blind obedience, or family values and political parties which our grandparents espoused -the non-functional aspects are being cast aside and a feeling of rootlessness and lack of tradition is sweeping institutions and personal thinking. The fundamentalists with their knee-jerk reactions are everywhere filled with fear, howling with loss and preaching religious facism.

Governments everywhere are not representing the true wishes of the people, many of whom are too preoccupied with material concerns to notice. It is the confusion of change, of the Unconscious emerging personally and globally, and the traditional power brokers in govermment, religion, and big money are scared. This confusion is like the person who has just gotten out of a bad marriage. The external constraints are gone but the echo of bad habits and negative patterns still holds until the person "finds herseff."

My dreams rise up and challenge me to look a little deeper, to find my voice in society a bit more radical and honest, to communicate to others through healing myself. It's the voice of God appearing in my world through my remembering an inner life. By simply enjoying my creative work and being a father this "remembering" is happening to me.

So why not hope that the DNB can become a big international magazine that truly shares the inspirations of inner lives, offering honest solutions to the dilemmas of the modern world? No communication between people is more honest and rewarding than the sharing of dreams -- at least in my experience!

## Ann Wiseman Interview continued from page 1

I had been traveling around the country training teachers in creativity and about obstacles to learning. Eventually I began to realize that you cannot teach creativity to people who are stuck and closed down. I decided that I had better find out more about how to release blocked places. Knowing that everyone has the hear. Imagery, really, is a feelingdescribing language. In these workshops, l ask class participants two questions: "If something really big could come through for you today, what would it be?" and "Are you willing to risk letting it happen?" People risk more than they come prepared to do. They teach themselves amazing things and have tremendous breakthroughs.

After that dream I felt like I was

## "We cannot do anything that we cannot image."

capacity for originality in dream imagery, l looked for a way to help people tap their own psychic resource.

Two cornerstones of my dreamwork came to me about that time--one through a Zen-like experience at Esalen and the other through a powerful dream. In the Zen experience, I understood that teaching is not something that you do. You simply are at the right place when the person is ready to know what they know. We all really teach ourselves from the youngest to the oldest. In that experience l learned that the reason I thought that others knew more than I did was because I refused to take responsibility for what Iknew. That was tremendously valuable knowledge.

In the dream, I was standing on the rim of the universe. I was a little speck sticking out in the universe. A great trumpeting megaphone in the sky shouted these words: "Find the image and satisfy it!" Now that really is the essence of $\mathrm{my}$ work and the basis of change. Dreams are so precious because they give us the image. When you work in tandem with your dreams, you've got your source working with you.

Now I do Self-Balancing workshops. I just turned it around. Instead of showing, I simply make a very quiet space where people can get in touch with their feelings. They teach themselves what they need to being carried by forces larger than myself. I have no idea where it will take me. In my life and in my work, I simply go where the doors are open and it feels right.

Jill: My next question, I know, is a challenging one for people who use active imagination techniques in their dreamwork. Would you describe how you work with a dream? using kitchen silver and salt and pepper shakers to describe their relationship. It is not a question of art or talent; it is just a rough visual representation. We cannot do anything that we cannot image. Once the dream is mapped, we do the "restaging." Using several different processes, like guided imagery and dialoguing with the dream characters, we solve the issue that is in the picture. We find ways to transform obstacles into positive energy. Missing pieces are brought in and the clients move through the steps to their own best solution.

I ask a lot of questions, like, "What do you like about this map that you have made? What don't you like about this map? If you were powerful, how would you change this? What do you need? How does that feel? Is there something that you could try? If this is your goal, what are your options?" And so forth. I guess that there is a lot of intuitive sensing that goes on that you really can't explain. But mostly I give questions that provoke the dreamer to explore

## "When you work in tandem with your dreams, you've

 got your source working with you."Ann: My dreamwork grew out of an awareness that very young children have highly sophisticated imagery. I knew this because I had a very powerful dream dealing with the meaning of life and the process of creation and destruction at the age of one and a half or two. Theretore I assumed that there must be a safe way for children, and adults working with children, to explore dream material. The method that evolved is safe and yet powerful for dreamers of all ages. I call it, "Mapping and ReStaging the Dream."

I have the client put the dream on paper. One of my favorite mediums is torn colored paper. But it can be drawn or done with whatever objects are handy--you know, like we used to describe plays in ball games possibilities that they might not explore on their own. Iknow that I am asking the wrong questions if the client becomes resistent. My new book, Dreams and Symbolic Healing, (Ansayre Press, Cambridge, 1987), is filled with examples of this process. Other examples can be found in my book, Nightmare Help, which is a guide for adults and parents working with children's nightmares.

Jill: When you work with me on my dreams, I am struck by the potency of your dreamwork style. There must be a lot of therapeutic principles involved. Would you point out some of the major dynamics of your dreamwork?

Ann: Yes. By putting the
dream in art form, both the dreamworker and the client can step outside of the dream and leave the stuck part of themselves on the paper stage. Now they are both equals-empowered, creative problem-solvers caring for the person stuck on the map. This avoids transference since the dreamworker does not have the answers but rather functions as a facilitator and provocateur. The mapping also serves as a quick way of telling the dream story so that the listener knows the logistics. It is a short cut to a lot of vital data. Also, style or habit, the person needs to acknowledge that the strategy, even in its negative form, has served him and understand what it has been doing for him. After it has been appreciated, change can be negotiated.

Sequence is a vital part of the therapeutic process. You simply cannot make changes unless you have the right sequence. One of my favorite examples of this is one little girl's solution to her dream of being trapped inside her buming house. Getting out of the house and calling very interesting in this work because those are the conditions for change. The client is willing to change, but only if you are willing to consider their obstacles.

Much of my work involves the client finding their "Inner Child" and their "Higher Self." You can't get out of your stuck places unless you go back to the source, find the Inner Child, and repair the problem. The Higher Self is the holder of our great wisdom. When we take responsibility for what our Higher Self knows, we become our own greatest ally. We

Projects and Experiments

Send your flying dreams to Ansayre Press, 284 Huron Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138. Ann will present a preliminary report of her findings in the next issue of Dream Network Bulletin. since the paper stage is the subconscious language of color, shape and size in relationship, the client's censors are bypassed, again relaying valuable information.

The re-staging of the dream permits the client to make many rehearsals before making life changes. Finding the solution to the dream picture will produce a residue in the client which will mature and manifest in their life. It is a way of safely absorbing your own information.

Pattern is something that I look for in the dream. It is a style of being in the world that the individual has adopted usually quite early in life. I call it an "Infant Survival Strategy." When children have to reach into the pond of life and pull out a survival strategy, they'll take anything that works. Otten these are negative things that don't work beyond childhood. In order to modify that for help are the obvious solutions, but she presented three obstacles which had to be overcome before she could do that. One, that she was not permitted to leave the house when her parents were not there. Two, that if she did get out of the house, she was not allowed to cross the avenue alone. Three, that upon arriving at the place where her mother was, she could not enter because the doorknob was too high. (All three of these obstacles had to be solved before she could do the obvious. You can't presume to know a person's answers until you know their obstacles.) In order to come to a solution, the missing piece was permission to think tor herself in an emergency. And once she had the permission, she created a policeman to help her cross the avenue and she found a crate to stand on to reach the door handle. The posing of obstacles is can be the good parent to our Inner Child and give it what it needs.

## Jill: Ann, what are your current projects?

Ann: In addition to the SelfBalancing workshops I mentioned before, I am collecting samples of flying dreams and out-of-bodyexperiences for a book which I hope to illustrate.

Just completed is a new book, Dreams and Symbolic Healing which is a combination of my dream and imaging work, my body-mapping workshops, Nightmare Help material and my thesis. The whole book pivots on the power of the image as problem-solver and symbolic healer. I hope to have a preview pilot edition available for sale at the Association for the Study of Dreams Conterence in June in Washington, D.C., where I will be presenting my work as well.

One of the ways my Dream Self really catches my attention is by making jokes. She was in her most humorous mood recently during a fiveweek dream study class.

Twelve of us, part of a larger group which had been studying the Seth material for several years, met once a week. Our intentions were to try for "group dreams," especially of Seth's "Sumari City," and to have lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences. The class was also to give us intensive practice in interpreting our dreams in relation to our daily lives.

We were instructed in ways to get out-of-body by Rick, our leader, who for years had been telling us that traveling out-of-body is both easy and fun, giving us many examples from his own experience. Among many possible techniques, he emphasized suggesting before sleep that we become conscious of dreaming by recognizing either that we were flying or other "incongruities."

Two or three members of the group were experienced $O O B$ travelers, others had had one or two such experiences or had them during the class. I had had none, though I have had many flying dreams and several lucid dreams, some very dramatic. During the entire five weeks I still had none, but my Dream Self executed a continuous, playful dance around the group project, incubating dreams, flying dreams, and the topics that she wanted me to consider; mainly questions of self-worth and how I block myself from full selfexpression.

The first night we had been told to set an alarm about 4 a.m. and record any dreams. I dreamed:

I am in a motel with my exhusband. We are to make seven trips for a project. Igo downstairs to make arrangements. The manager says he can't book a room for seven nights, only one or two. My husband is mad. He calls up the manager and makes a fuss. The manager will do what he can. We are packing a bag to go on the first trip. My husband criticizes everything I do although it is all his idea.

Even though Rick had

impressed on us the importance of recording every dream, and this was the first night of a project to which I was really committed, I felt a familiar reluctance to turn on the light and write the dream down: "I'll have trouble going to sleep again. I'll remember it in the moming."

Fortunately, going sleepily over the dream, I was struck by the number seven. Of course, seven

## BY MARY NEWMAN

nights before the next dream class! The dream's actually talking about itself, and my resistance to it. I interpreted the "full-up rooms" as the other projects and activities filling my mind and time. I recorded this and went to sleep again, waking up the next morning after three more dreams all illustrating my resistance to working on the project. I had suspected a selfcritical, animus figure in my exhusband. Dream Self kindly confirmed this in the fourth dream of the night:

I'm in bed with my husband. We are at opposite ends of the bed. facing each other. We are lying under three blankets, one pink, one blue, one gold. We are joking, slightly unpleasantly, about the fact that there are really four people in the bed, including his anima and my animus.

The next night Dream Self reminded me that I am quite experienced in dream work:
I'm a member of a group like the Secret Service. Igo with another member to retrace the path of one of our heroes, who has now left us. We go through green fields with cows and hedgerows. We are to recognize certain landmarks; a bent tree, etc. These are actually symbols, clues to something else we are really looking for. My companion comments that I enjoy doing this, and am good at it.

During the remainder of this first week, every theme that was to come up in the whole class was commented on in my dreams; even the fact that I didn't like one lucid dream experiment because it involved getting out of bed, and it was cold. I had a dream full of incongruities, which I didn't recognize, and an ecstatic dream of a whirling group dance, the closest I came to flying or the "Sumari City."

I also had a major dream on the subject of self-worth:

I have just been made Prime Minister of England. I arrive at Buckingham Palace with its very vivid, beautiful lawns and gardens. Igo to meet the Queen. She's not there. She has gone out for a cup of coffee with a Marine and is severely criticized for this--it's just not done. (I have summarized a long dream.)

Becoming P.M. would mean replacing Margaret Thatcher, in waking life, a former college classmate. I had recently been bemoaning how litle I felt I had done with my life in comparison with such Women of Achievement.

Two days later, I visited an exhibition with my sister, a perfect example of the successtul, academic woman, contemptuous of anything irrational (such as dreams), to whom I easily feel inferior. That night I dreamed:

A group of businessmen is meeting. The worman who was to address them has dropped out. I agree to take over. I have had no preparation. I am to give a lecture on three paintings which are on the wall behind me. I stand up on a table and start talking. I see that the men are
not interested: they are discussing business under their breath. But I am fascinated by the paintings and enjoy studying them (the dream project, which I'm interested in, whether "businessmen" are or not).

During the next week I tried extremely hard to have an OOBE, getting up and reading for half an hour at 3 a.m., then trying to go to sleep on my chaise lounge, which I immediately discovered was much too short. I returned to bed and tried to go to sleep on my back. No success. I gave myself several lucid dream suggestions and tried several techniques, such as "imagining I was flying," and "trying to walk down a road into my dream."

At some point while I was trying to go back to sleep, the thought crossed my mind that l'd like some help on my difficulties with love relationships. That did interest Dream Self, where all my efforts to produce an OOBE apparently didn't. I had a very long dream about a terrible row with my ex-husband.

By this time we were accumulating so many projects to try in between dream classes that there were hardly enough nights in the week. The main new ones were to incubate a dream topic and to ask for a "True Dream from the Gates of Horn." Dream Self had her own ideas about these also. While I repeated many times the suggestion for "a True Dream from the Gates of Horn," it was once again a fleeting thought, "I'd like a dream about my new house," that was responded to.

The next night was the one for incubating a dream on a specific subject. As I had just dreamed about the house, I asked, "Will I be happy there?"

I'm back in high school. An unpleasant woman says I can't stay in the program because I'm not doing well enough. I'm very angry. I know much more than she does. I appeal to my favorite teacher but he doesn't support me. No one tells me what I've failed to do, and I know I've done well in most of my classes. I go into a back room and climb up on some shelves to cut a piece of cake.

The rest of the class were as amused as I was at the suggestion that I might be "thrown out of the program" for not doing well enough. I certainly wasn't doing very well at incubating lucid dreams, but other things, such as remembering many dreams, and applying them to my life, which others found difficult, were usually a "piece of cake" for me.

Now it was the very last night before the very last class. Dream Self was still joking. I made desperate suggestions to incubate at least one OOBE or lucid dream, or even a flying dream:

I am on a train to Montreal. I sit in the dining car in my robe. A gruff but pleasant man sits beside me. He tells me firmly, "The spaceport is closed." There was one more joke to come.

Allies From Another Country...

The painting "Familia Reflected: Allies From Another Country" (illustrated here) was created from a dream of incredible quintessence; a dream that brought me to the feeling of dimension, an extension of another world that now pervades and permeates the very atmosphere of my life.

In the beginning of the dream I am traveling with someone who is with me only in presence. As we come to a doonvay we separate. I continue to travel downward in direction. My motion is slow and deliberate. I am not aware of my surroundings until I find myself with a round table located in the middle of a room. The surface of the table is very shiny and smooth. Sitting at opposite ends of the table are two beings. The one nearest motions me to sit next to it. I am unable to tell if they are men or women. Their appearance is androgynous coupled with a strange fluctuation of being sometimes masculine, sometimes feminine. Clothed in long black monk-like robes with hoods loosely fitted around their heads, their dark faces are framed in a deceiving light.

I sit down at the table and the one who is across from me asks to see my fist. "Don't you mean my palm?" I ask in surprise. "No," it commands. "Let me see your fist." । reach my arm across the table and place my fist in its strong dark hands. "You will make it in this lifetime," it says, first examining my fist, then looking at me squarely in the eyes. I then question, "Don't you mean I am making it now?" "No," it repeats. "You will make it in this lifetime."

"Your mother loved you very much," the creature next to me says as it explores my palm. "My mother never loved me, I I contradict.

"Everyone you meet mirrors you," it says and I explain, "I mirror everyone I meet."

Although I don't recall the rest
To those of us who pay close attention to dreams, there exists a place of exceptional wonder; a country of images which leads us to a new way to perceive not only ourselves but the world around us. It is no mystery to those of us who work with dreams, that some come with such significance that they take on the special character of the soul...

robed phantom beings. The sense of love and belonging that continued to travel with me, grew with each recall of the dream. And then within this mood I became compelled to reproduce the expression of this vision. I knew at once, I would not paint the embrace at this time. It proved to be more a feeling, a sense of an impression rather than an image. So I let it go until later, knowing in my heart that the images were there in me and would come forward in time.

There are rare occasions that do exist when a piece of work seems to magically create itself. Forms come together, seeming to have a life of their own, bleeding through the canvas like a stain from the other side of the cloth. And I remember, as each face became alive with an expression of familiarity, the round table emerged as the moon, a mandala of the sky, or a crystal ball anchored by the enclosing figures around it.

Soon I was to recognize the essence of the painting as the presence I traveled with at the beginning of the dream; the spirit split into visible forms living now in waking hours, peering through the window of a portrait of a dream. Dorothy Rossi 831--45th Avenue San Francisco, CA 94121

of the conversation I know it continues this way for quite some time, going over issues that I was concerned with at that time in my life. I will say something; it says the opposite. It says something; I say the contrary. But there is no argument, no debate. This is all done in a genuine attitude of fact.

The energy begins to be very active and more black robed phantoms float into the room. They sit down around the table. Even though these creatures penetrate the surroundings with an ominous aura, I feel they mean me no harm. Yet there is an uneasiness that is growing.

It becomes quiet. My mind is determined to lift the veil from this riddle. The inhabiting of this strange room with these curious beings grows into a sense of apprehension. Fear rises in me. The fear is a cue to the creature across the table. It gets up and comes around until it is standing behind me, bending down while encouraging me to also stand. It leans forward close enough so that I can feel it grow in height. I wait transfixed in anticipation. It moves closer, reaching down to wrap its arms like wings around me. It cradles me securely and rocks me back and forth. I feel a great warmth and an incredible sense of peace and harmony enter my body. I know by this embrace I am being fine tuned with the universe. I say, "Is this someone I know, or someone I will meet?" They all sing out in a voice of great resonance,

"This is Familia."

I feel myself slowly moving into waking consciousness like a tiny canoe slipping through the water to the shore on a gentle current. And as the days pass I am haunted by the hypnotic chant of the voices of these dark-

## RECORDING YOUR DREAMS

BY LINDA RENEAU (RAVENWOLF)

Recording your dreams doesn't have to take a lot of time, even if you usually remember more than one long dream every morning.

You can develop your own abbreviations, shorthand, and symbols. You can sketch and cluster dream images and events. I have listed below some of my most common notations and an example of a recorded dream which would have taken two pages to write out in words. Besides making it easy for me to record my dreams when I don't have a lot of time, this nonlinear approach helps me understand my dreams faster. It's also an enjoyable and creative activity in itself.

## DREAM TAROT。 <br> © Strephon Kaplan Williams 1986 author of the Jungian-Senoi Dreamwork Manual

Universal dream themes have much to give us in life. Using the techniques suggested here, you can experience the dream and its issues. The Jungian-Senoi approach emphasizes actualization over interpretation, which means that it uses dreamwork methodology rather than symbol systems for gaining

## The Dream -- <br> THE TIGER COMES

I dreamed that a tiger came into the house where a bunch of us were. We all scattered. I climbed up on top of the door. It prowled underneath me and finally went on down the hall. I was relieved that it did not try to get me.

## Comments and Issues

The dreamer was afraid and naturally did not try to encounter the tiger directly. But when is it best to encounter an adversary and when is it best to leave it alone and see what happens? The dreamer chose the latter course and was relieved. The worst did not happen when the dreamer did not try to control the situation. The worst is more likely to happen when we do try to control things out of fear.

One way to deal with fear is simply to experience it. meaning from dreams.

Procedure

1. Read the dream and then go into a meditative state with your eyes closed and see the dream for yourself. Allow or place yourself and your own dream or life character in the dream in place of the original characters.
2. Re-enact the dream still in the meditative state and immediately record your insights and feelings.
3. Read the commentary here and the issues and questions. Respond to anything which is evocative for you, positive or negative.
4. Bring your experience to essence in a principle, insight or life task for yourself. You might also put your experience into art or movement, or discuss it with a friend or guide. You have then made the dream your own.

Another way is to contract and hide. A third way is to go on the attack. And a fourth way is to resolve the issue causing the fear.

## Tasks and Questions

What would you have done had you been this dreamer? If nothing comes to mind immediately, then why not close your eyes and see yourself in the dream. Let the tiger come and see what happens.

You have a chance to experience and deal with fear here. Let go to the dream. Reenter the dream and let it evoke things for you. What feelings come up? What attitudes, or unconscious laws, seem to be behind those feelings?

What has the dreamer learned in the dream by staying present to the situation? What can you learn from the way the dreamer handled the tiger? What would happen if you let out more tiger energy in your life?

Dreamwork has a long tradition of successful application in the area of personal mental health and therapy. But what about that other crucial arena of life: the workplace? Freud said that dreams are basically concerned with love and work. Of the two, work-related issues have definitely been neglected.

Can dreamwork be useful in the management of modern business organizations? There are many anecdotal reports of valuable insights gained by individuals through their dreams. But larger-scale studies involving entire organizations are almost nonexistent. (1)

Early in 1986 a team of professional dreamwokers worked carefully with a group of top managers from a modern corporation to test the potential of managers' dreams. This is a report of that pilot project.
Dream consulting differs from more traditional dream therapy in terms of its units of analysis, its objectives, and its methods. Dream consulting focuses on the organization as a whole, not the individual. It aims to improve the organization itself, especially the quality of its decision-making. The methods are tailored to the "family" nature of an organization of employees working together daily to solve organizational problems.

Dream consulting can be defined as: the process of improving an organization's effectiveness by using its members' dreams productively. Dream consulting is a new genre of management consulting, distinguished primarily by the uniqueness of its source of insight.
Business organizations have traditionally resisted dreamwork even more than the society in general. Beyond the usual resistances of fear of the unknown, fear of ridicule, and fear of change, most business managers are particularly hesitant to deviate from logical, analytical decision-making modes where major financial outcomes are at risk, especially unorthodoxies bordering on the "psychic."

Fortunately, a powerful new movement stressing the value of intuition has been developing from within the business community itself. This trend toward intuitive management, led by Weston Agor, John Naisbitt, and Philip Goldberg, has helped open the door for dreamwork, lending it a new interest and potential legitimacy. ( 2 )

## DREAM CONSULTING:

## A PILOT PROJECT WITH A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION BY KENT SMITH

## PROJECT BACKGROUND

Principals in the dream project initiated numerous contacts with business organizations in the preceding year through informal contacts and formal presentations. But no suitable candidate could be found. Managers were reluctant to waste such a valuable organizational resource as managers' time on such an untried idea.

Finally, in December of 1985 , the right organization was found. Through the personal invitation of one of the team, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a medium-size corporation located in San Jose, California agreed to try. Professional Training, Inc. (PT) was founded in 1976, employs over 100 people in 7 locations in 4 states, and enjoys multi-million dollar annual revenues. (3) It specializes in educational training programs for adult professionals. The specific unit for the dream project was the top management of the Northern California Regional Division headquartered in the midst of the high-tech electronics center known as "Silicon Valley."

## OBJECTIVES

The dream team itself had two principal goals for the project. First, they wanted to see if dreamwork could be successfully applied to help a modern business corporation. Secondly, the team wanted to test various experimental techniques which if proven productive could be used more widely.

For the company managers, there were three main objectives:

I. "To improve organizational decision-making by applying the dream mind to better identify, understand, and solve managers' problems";

2. "To enable individual managers to derive meaningful messages from their dreams", and, less importantly;
3. To train the managers in the skills of understanding and applying their dreams.

This was an ambitious agenda!

## METHODS

The dreamworkers team was composed of 4 professionals. Three of the 4 members have had extensive experience in organized dreamwork as dreamgroup leaders, therapists, and teachers. (See the Team Members in the Appendix for details.) All have worked together previously and were associated with the Dream Training Insitute of California in San Francisco.

The team met separately on two occasions before the project began in order to prepare the plan and the materials.

Eight managers were selected
as participants by Professional Training, Inc. They included the founder and President, his Special Assistant, the Regional Division Manager, the Marketing Manager, the Branch Manager, the Reference Specialist, the Portfolio Chief, and the Administrative Assistant. There were 3 males and 5 females with an average age of approximately 40 and an average length of company employment of $7+$ years. Participants were selected by the President's Special Assistant on the basis of managerial status and personal interest.

The basic dreamwork itself occurred during the private individual consultations each week. To understand the managers' dreams, the dreamworkers primarily used the Dream Definition Analysis techniques developed by Gayle Delaney. (4) The managers were also trained in

Delaney's secular incubation methods. (5) Three of the dreamworkers also have extensive training in psychology and/or family therapy. The fourth worked professionally as a business management consultant.

## THE SESSIONS

The dream team planned 3 afternoon sessions to be held weekly at the company's offices for the pilot project. Each session lasted 3 hours from 3 to 6 p.m. and involved 2 phases: the individual consultations and the general plenary discussion afterwards.

Phase I was composed of individual one-on-one dream consultations involving one manager and one dreamworker lasting up to an hour each week. Dreamers were requested to bring in all dreams recalled in written form. Dreamers were assured of confidentiality if requested. Dreamers' comments and acknowlegements were carefully respected and dreamworker projections were purposely minimized.

Dreamworkers would review the week's written dreams, searching for symbols with prima facie reference to the workplace, especially fellow employees, locations, and office paraphernalia. Dreamworkers focused attention on the dreams which seemed relevant to the organization and its problems. If a manager had no current dream, the dreamworker encouraged the manager to remember a long-past dream, or instructed the manager in recall techniques.

After the week's individual consultations, the dreamworkers gathered in a short caucus to review all the week's dreams and decide which few merited group discussion. The hour-long plenary conferences were devoted primarily to selected key dreams, their possible meanings, and their possible applications to the organization. Participants were encouraged to talk freely and several lively discussions were generated. Homework assignments concluded each weekly session.

SESSION 1 (January 27, 1986)<br>The project got off to a good

start, with 7 of the 8 managers present. Six of the 7 had dreams for processing, usually written and often typed. Assignments were made and the individual consultations were held in the managers' private offices. Each dreamworker worked with the same two managers throughout the project.

The general conference started with 2 short presentations by two dreamworkers: one on "Intuitive Management," the second on "Dream Skills." The first dream discussed (from the Marketing Manager) showed her desk bombarded by reports of all kinds. The group easily related to the avalanche of paperwork and sympathetic comments echoed around the table. The second dream (by the President's Special Assistant) depicted a female figure dying. This sparked a discussion of "female" qualities like intuition and feelings and their subordination to "male" logic and numbers in the organization's decision-making.

Participants were instructed to incubate a dream on an organizational

problem of interest to them over the coming week.

## SESSION 2 (FEBRUARY 3, 1986)

All 8 managers were present for this session, 7 of them with written dreams including one with 4 dreams. The individual consultations went more efficiently and smoothly since the partners knew each other better. In the joint conference, the first dream (by the Branch Manager) concerned job confusion and inspired her to devote an extra Saturday to cleaning up her messy desk.

The highlights of the session were the two dreams (by the President) photocopied and circulated to the group. The first, in apparent response to the incubation question, showed him how to become more effective in marketing by being more like "Tip O'Neill." The second showed two brothers, one more idealistic, the other more practical, and their inter-dynamics. Both dreams provoked very intense and emotional discussions.

Participants decided among themselves to incubate dreams about marketing and/or employee teamwork for the next session. Electricity was in the air as the participants filed out of the room.

## SESSION 3 (February 10, I986)

Five managers had dreams for the final session, one had no recall, and 2 were absent, including the President and the Division Manager. The individual consultations proceeded smoothly.

The general conference focused on 4 dreams. The first (by the Marketing Manager) apparently responded to the assigned incubation and showed how old methods, old images, and a "weird" name were hampering PT's marketing program. The second (by the Administrative Assistant) and the third (by the Special Assistant) showed aspects of personnel relations in the organization comparable to a "CIA surveillance system" and a "bleak and gray" landscape with a "fortress." The fourth dream (by the Branch Manager) involved a group of teenagers in a fancy car on a holiday off on a wrong track. The dreams generated some commentary, but considerable reluctance to discuss the apparent issues in a completely open manner was evident. One issue, the managers simply refused to talk about whatsoever. The absence of the President also dampened enthusiasm.

The dreamworker team summarized the results they believed had come out of the sessions and listed a set of options for continuing the project in the future.

## DREAMWORKERS' DREAMS

Although the main substance

of the sessions was the dreams of the managers, the dream consultants shared several significant dreams which they had themselves. Two seemed to suggest that the 3-week duration for the project was too short. Another showed that the dreams should not be hidden away in the private consulting sessions but were meant to nourish the entire group in public. Another pointed to important personality aspects of a key manager. A final dream said very firmly, "It's results that count."

## RESULTS

To the dreamworkers, corroborated by the managers, five major findings emerged from the project:

1. That dreams are meaningfully related to managers' personal and professional lives.
Dreams showed the managers things as they are, not how they wished they were or feared they were.
2. That dreams can be targeted for insight and problem-solving in the organizational setting. Seven of the 8 managers reported successful incubations on topics of personal concern.
3. That dream interpretation skills can be learned by managers. Five of the managers achieved successes working independently with the dreams of others. They felt confident, given more time, training, and practice, that they could learn the dream definition analysis skills.
4. That dreamwork can improve managerial decision-making. The incubations on better marketing and the dreams about overwhelming paperwork and disorderly desks were the most prominent examples. Other dreams, kept confidential by managers' requests, also proved strikingly insightful.
5. That dreamwork can open important new lines of communication between managers. Even though the 8 managers had worked together for the same organization for years, dream sharing revealed areas of deep concern which were widely felt, but not communicated. It was like fresh solvent freeing up rust-bound structures.

These results were the concensus of the dreamworkers, supported by the comments of the managers. No systematic survey of the participants by interview or questionnaire was undertaken after the project. The findings were based on expressed opinions only. No organizational performance data was evaluated.

## DISCUSSION

For such a novel effort, many components of the project worked well. The dreamworkers' team

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_a4a35e3c71e19f5b3b30g-16.jpg?height=215&width=1909&top_left_y=2351&top_left_x=86)
functioned very well together and worked effectively with the managers under severe time constraints. The team members enthusiastically shared dreams, techniques, and insights on the hour's ride back and forth from San Francisco. The team functioned harmoniously because of considerable dreamwork experience, past working relations, uniform techniques, and mutual respect.

The managers were prolific in recalling and recording their dreams. Of 24 scheduled consultations ( 8 managers over 3 weeks), 18 involved 1 or more dreams. The team -- which initially expected far less, about $50 \%$ productive consultation sessions -was surprised at the volume of available dreams and the managers' willingness to recall and record them.

Many of the project's procedural decisions turned out to be correct. Weekly sessions allowed for sufficient dreaming time between meetings. Private consultations and strict confidentiality were essential for safe participation. The pairing assignments were excellent -- never a complaint. The text and the homework assignments kept the managers focused and attentive. The joint sessions were tightly organized and several discussions were quite productive.

Several aspects of the project, however, caused major problems. The time allowed - - 3 weeks -- was much too short. Although such a limited commitment of company resources made the initial decision to go ahead with the project much easier, the truncated time framework made it impossible to achieve the ambitious goals.

Throughout the general sessions, most of the managers held back from expressing their deeper feelings on crucial volatile issues. What managers easily revealed in the private consultations was time and again never voiced in the plenary conferences. Fear of job security prevented much serious discussion. The managers knew the underlying power relationships and dynamics and were unwilling to risk challenging or even discussing certain vital policies. The team greatly overestimated the willingness of the managers to talk freely.

The team also failed to secure a commitment from the company to continue the work in some concrete form. Although "continuity" was stressed and follow-up options presented, none were accepted before the project ended.

Future dreamwork projects with organizations could be better designed from lessons learned from this pioneering effort. We recommend:

I. That the time framework be doubled or tripled. Two to 3 months of weekly sessions seems the minimum productive duration.

2. That the top manager or CEO be strongly supportive of the project from the beginning. The CEO should probably be worked with initially alone successfully before others are involved, should be publicly vocally supportive, and should lead the way in sharing dreams and honest nonthreatening discussion.
3. That fewer managers be involved in the project and that they be as near as possible equals in terms of power, responsibility, and dream enthusiasm.
4. That more systematic objective study of participating managers' reactions be undertaken before, during, and after the project to better monitor changes and results.
5. That the outcomes of specific decisions influenced by dream insights be carefully investigated to test the key hypothesis that improved managerial decison-making results from informed professional dreamwork.
6. That careful study of measures of organizational performance in terms of traditional indicators such a revenues, profit, ROI, turnover, and absenteeism be undertaken, particularly for projects of longer duration.
7. That additional dream consultation projects be launched with other management groups in different kinds of organizations from both the public and private sectors, particularly government agencies, non-profit charities, foundations, and manufacturing companies.

The results from this pioneering project, we feel, are very promising. We were particularly impressed by the professional teamwork of the dreamworkers, the dream production of the managers, and the accuracy and power of the dreams themselves. We are convinced that the whole field of dream consulting has extraordinary potential for improving whole organizations. We encourage other dreamworkers to explore and develop this enormous potential.

## THE EGYPTIAN MUMMY:

## A REINCARNATIONAL DRAMA

## BY KATHERINE MARK

## THE DREAM

Tuesday, March 2nd, 1982

I stepped into the kitchen of my prior home, where I had lived for many years. A large white pot, containing homemade chicken soup, stood on the gleaming white electric range. I touched the side of the pot to see if it was cool enough to remove the chicken bones from the soup. It was. I reached into the cupboard and brought out a container to put the bones in. While I was struggling, deboning the chicken, some of the greasy soup stock splattered onto the counter and dripped to the floor. When I was finished, I realized that before I could clean up the mess I made, I would have to go to the store to buy some soap.

I walked outside and proceeded to the corner store, where I purchased a gold colored plastic bucket that contained loose soap. When I returned to my kitchen, I sat the bucket down on the white Formica counter next to the stove. Then, I noticed the container with the chicken bones was gone. Iglanced around wondering what had happened to it. I noticed the white and gold chip vinyl floor covering had much more chicken grease on it than I had spilled. It trailed to the landing and steps that led to the basement. I followed the trail down the steps and entered the basement.

I was surprised at the amount of grease that was splattered on the basement floor tile, but only at the entrance area. The recreation area looked like a business office of some kind, with many books visible. I glanced at the far wall and saw a package wrapped in plain tan wrapping paper, laying on the floor. It was about a foot wide and long. I thought someone from the family had taken the discarded chicken bones and wrapped them, but instead of taking them outside to the garbage, had brought them down here.

I walked over and picked up the package. I decided l'd better investigate the contents to make sure what was inside. I started to unwrap the package, and discovered the wrapping paper had turned to burlap. I became uneasy because the package began to grow. The more I

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_a4a35e3c71e19f5b3b30g-18.jpg?height=672&width=1162&top_left_y=1819&top_left_x=186)

unwrapped the package, the heavier and larger it became. When the wrapping at the ends became loose, the package became too heavy for me to hold. With trembling arms I carried it to the green counter and laid it down.

One end of the package came undone to expose the wrapped legs of a mummy. As I stared dumbiounded at it, the mummy began to kick off the ancient leg wrappings. I was shocked that it was alive and moving. I thought I was about to see a skeleton, when human female legs appeared. They were quite slender and were shod in soft footwear that looked like moccasins. A beige colored garment with some dried blood stains was ankle length. The purple-blue trimming around her moccasins and hemline made me think she was an Egyptian mummy.

Ibegan to feel very uncomfortable with the mummy unwrapping herself. I thought it would not be healthy for all that was hidden all these years to come into the air suddenly. It should be covered up and opened properly later. Suddenly, the Egyptian mummy's head appeared. She had long black, unkempt hair, dark eyes, and spoke. "I want to get out."

"No," I answered her. "The air isn't good for you." I picked her up and laid her down on the floor against the knotty pine wall partition. Then I covered her up completely with a powder blue blanket and said, "Now you stay covered up and don"t move."

I was more concerned about who was going to clean up all this greasy mess from the floor. Who, in my family, was going to do it? Hearing footsteps coming down the basement stairs and the creaking of the door slowly opening brought me to attention. I was mildly surprised to
see a lady I knew from the family business I was once involved in. She approached and said, "I have teenagers who will clean up this mess if you'll give them one of your records."

"Why?" I asked.

"Because, a teenager will do any kind of work for a record."

"These records aren't mine to give away," I replied. "I don't really own them; I just have them." I left her and walked up the stairs, still wondering who was going to clean up that chicken grease and who'd take care of the Egyptian mummy?

I walked into my living room and sat in an easy chair. Someone invisible said, "All your books would be better for you if you'd transfer them from the basement and use them here where you can enjoy them."

## THE INTERPRETATION

The basement represents my subconscious. The house described was exactly as it had been during the many years we had raised our children, except at that time, there wasn't any office in the basement recreation area. It seems I still had some unresolved family problems buried deep in my subconscious from the past as the Egyptian mummy symbol represented. Chickens represent a family atom and this was a messy situation because of the chicken grease on the floor (my foundation). It was going to be coming to a head now and taken apart (deboning the chicken). This could also have been a repeated situation from a past lifetime where I was killed (dried bloodstains on Egyptian mummy's clothing). But in this lifetime it would be resolved. I would enjoy it and someone else would take care of it, because someone invisible said, "Transfer your books (Akasic records) upstairs and enjoy them." The lady that appeared in the basement was someone I knew from the family business, plus the business office, so the situation would have to pertain to this.

In its formative years, I had always felt that the family business would some day be turned over to our children when they became adults and my husband and I retired. Unfortunately, by the time they became adults, the business was incorporated with strangers, and my husband and I were divorced. The ownership of the stocks changed hands several times through the years. Recently, I was pleasantly surprised when I was informed that the majority of the stocks from the family business were signed over to my children. Someone else did clean up that chicken grease, and I could sit back in my easy chair and relax. It was written in my Akasic records.

Doctors measure my emotion with stethoscopes and tongs. I carry a camera, my cassette recorder and roam.

Family, foes and friends cameoed in this series of my visions. Dead ones call, leave word to "keep in touch."

Floor to floor, wing to wing in the room of my construction, I meet symphonies in progress, a corridor of actors rehearsing my lines.

Appraisals whispered in the galleries of my collage, my mixed media of impressions.

Here I taste blues, gray and gold.

Floors not so final as they roll. Ceiling nothing more than porcelain sky.

Guns melt away my palms.

Snow covers a sweltering June.

February 34 lives

on the calendar of my formation.
Moon an ocean of frozen brine. Cbuds turn stalactite and fall. Spacecrafts land on Main Street and the tea party chatter not so mad after all. The subject aesthetics, the lesson a docile fingernail weapon enough on the neck to draw blood. Asleep, my senses still keen to the scent of plant and perfume, the feel of concrete grit underfoot.

Carousels in subways whirl me to new connections.

Down the tunnel to those long gone, a front door at the end stands open. Inside on walls photographs are moving,

animating all my constant past dream meetings.

After all the chimeras, after all this life I may awake to find all was reverie and will ask what then is real.

story is right. Telling the story is one of the steps. It's like suddenly being recognized when you first come into a room.

Then I had another mental dream just before rising which cinched my decision:

RIGHT GEAR

A shifting into the right gear due to an influx of money and energy...

Part of the money and energy were contributed by my husband, Manny. Although he had previously been rather lukewarm about my dream interests, he suddenly became very interested in concrete creativity. As a computer graphics art instructor, he provided me with technical backup for the Macintosh computer which we purchased to format DNB.

The decision was confirmed when in early December, I had a dream of flying with Bob (as Superman). Suspended between the two of us was a young man wearing a NETWORK of hamess straps. The baby was growing up quickly!

Afterwards I began dreaming of introducing myself or being introduced as Editor of the Dream Network Bulletin--all this in non-lucid dreams:

## DNB INTRODUCTION TO

## DREAMWORKERS

$12 / 26 / 86$

I walk into a huge dirt, grass and gravel parking lot with cars fanning out in four directions from a central point (like the four points of a compass). At other times the cars appear to be metal barrels and sometimes just people! At any rate, a male host standing in the center introduces me as the new editor of the Dream Network Bulletin.

"Thank you very much,"I acknowledge the introduction. "I would like to ask you, my colleagues, for ideas on the Dream Network Bulletin."

First another gentleman asks for an article with a scientific or health bent. What he has in mind may be too analytical for the general readership, but I take out my secretarial notebook and dutifully write the suggestion down. Then a younger fellow off to the left calls out another request. "What? I can't hear you." I respond. He repeats it, but standing behind a group of barrels, he's hard to understand. "Could you come closer, I just can't hear you," I say and he comes over to where I'm seated in a long white gown, on a grassy curb near a single sapling. Iget the impression he's from Hawaii. "How about dreams that help people get jobs?" he says. Well, that would be a real interesting article, I think, but how in the heck am I supposed to come up with such a piece? I realize these people must think that all they need do is suggest articles and they'Il magically get written.

"Excuse me, I think some of you may have the wrong idea," I call out to the crowd, striding to the middle. "I'd like to clear it up..."

"...DNB gets articles in two ways:" I begin, "first of all from columnists and contributing editors-staff who are VOLUNTEERS." As the word "volunteers" echoes back to me, I continue, "and secondly from readers or contributors like yourselves....and possibly reprints." By the time l've finished my speech, I am awake.

The dream clearly emphasized the care and feeding of volunteers. I reaffirmed my intention to provide support and encouragement and began thinking up and initiating concrete ways to do just that. A "complimentary copy" of DNB for contributors was one idea.

I had already received some articles from Henry Reed which were included in the last issue of DNB, including Art Strock's "Health Related Dream Guidance". Then Richard Lind agreed to rewrite and shorten his article "Objective Content Analysis" in time for the first issue. Former editor Bob Van de Castle forwarded Walt Stover's "Dreams and the Big Career Change" to me. Because I had to do so little soliciting for the material, from my point of view, the articles were indeed written "magically".

I can't wait to see what comes in next!

DREAMS OF DNB

Contributing Editor Linda Reneau (Ravenwolf) and I met in person in April of 1985 . That first night, she had a dream about our Seth Dream Network collaboration which featured special kinds of shoes: casual tennis shoes with formal high heels (she shared this dream in Henry Reed's "Shoe Dreams" article). So "shoes" came to represent for me the characteristics of a combined dreamwork project.

In August of that year I had a dream of Linda which used the same symbology:

LASTOF OUR SPECIES 8/9/85

...I'm flying free, high above the Earth. From this height the ground looks misty. I am joined by some of my colleague/friends and we fly, hand-in-hand. On the right is a dark haired woman (Linda Ravenwolf) with her baby. On the left is a dark haired man (who I later identify as Bob Trowbridge) and a younger person.

The woman hands me the baby. A shoe falls off his right foot. Oh, oh, it's gone, I think, then remember that my male friend can fly quickly, so I tell him about it. He dives down after the falling shoe, retreives it, and brings it back. As I put the shoe on the baby's foot, I think about different ways of assuring that it won't fall off again: tying it tighter, changing it into a high, laced boot, or a shoe with a long sock top, etc.

Then I turn the baby (he's a bit stiff) so he won't get a "chapped face" from exposure to the wind. Ialso think about putting up a mental shielding to stop the wind altogether. But at the rate we're traveling, the wind is only lightly ruffling his blonde hair and he's sleeping soundly...

When I had heard Chris Hudson speak about DNB at the June 1985 ASD Conference, his "baby dream" resonated truly for me (See "Letter from Chris Hudson" in this issue).

For two years I dreamt about either being pregnant or with a baby. Knowing this wasn't to be taken literally (I've two children already), I wondered what I was "birthing" and attributed the dreams to my various projects. Finally, I had this dream: GOING INTOLABOR

I am staying in the very small, very crowded apartment of a close girlfriend in Southern California. I've come to a 3-day conference, even though I'm pregnant and close to term.

I suddenly feel the first contractions of labor. It's too far to go home, so (my husband) Manny will come to me. I get the feeling / will deliver the baby here.

The following month I traveled with Bob Trowbridge to a conference in southern California where Linda Ravenwolf and I were giving a presentation entitled "Dream Guidance". I stayed with Linda three nights before driving back home with Bob. Along the way, Bob and I talked about the possibility of a shared project. Four hours after returning home, I received a telephone call from Henry Reed offering me the Dream Network Bulletin. I immediately called Bob to ask if he'd like to be co-editor. He was as amazed by the synchronicity as I had been. We felt like the universe was tapping us on the shoulders with an "Ahem, you were saying?"

Thereafter, I began a series of dreams which brought up all my fears and worries surrounding the assumption of DNB: I was underground with emaciated chickens; trapped in a crazy house; suffering from the criticisms of other newsletter editors. Linda R. wrote me, "Are you sure you want to do this?"

So l incubated "Go" or "No go" with DNB? In response I had a "mental" dream--the type that makes perfect sense until I "click" into my usual waking consciousness and lose most, if not all, of it. This time there seemed to be interim steps where I was able to form sentences from the impressions I was perceiving. I was aware that the translation was far from being one-on-one; rather, the sentences were a shorthand for the entire experience. ("We" refers to everyone l'd contacted and who showed a willingness to contribute to DNB):

WEARE THESTORY 11/2/86
