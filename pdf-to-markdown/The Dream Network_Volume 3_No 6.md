## THE DREAM NET PROJECT COMPUTOR ASSISTED DREAM INTERPRETATION

## by

Henry Reed
Imagine telling your dream to your friendly personal computer. Upon hearing your dream, your computer interviews you about your feelings in the dream, your associations, to the various symbols and your memories for recent events. The computer then reminds you of similar symbols and themes from previous dreams and what was going on in your life at that time. The computer then helps you to create an animated cartoon of your dream while it analyses the movements in your cartoon in terms of your typical animation style and feeds you back insights on the feelings expressed in the animation sequence. If you wanted to dialogue with the images in the dream, the computer would analyse thematic sequences to your dialogues, explain how you were feeling in past times during the expression of similar themes and suggest areas to explore.

Upon request, your computer displays text and pictures concerning universal aspects of particular symbols in your dream, selected on the basis of your personal associative context. To help you distinguish between aspects of your dream symbols that are personal and those aspects that are more universal, the computer displays dreams from a

large dream bank containing the same symbols appearing in your dream, and helps you discover your dream's relationship to these more typical patterns. If your dream contained some important references to apparently external events, the computer would provide you with a survey of dream themes and symbols collected over the past 24 hours from around the world, and by providing you with visual statistics, helps you determine if your dream was unusual and idiosyncra-
tic, or if a significant number of other people were currently having dreams with similar themes or symbols. You could determine if your "earthquake" dream this morning, for example, was conveying a personal upset in terms of a personal metaphor or in terms of an objective event that was being used as a symbol around the world. If the nature of the dream was such that you wanted to contact others who were having similar dreams, the computer would promptly inform you of how
to contact those individuals.
This bit of science fiction fantasy may or may not seem appealing. Dreams are intimate and from the "right brain," while computers are definitely extensions of the "left brain" world. Dreams and computers have in common, however, the ability to process enormous amounts of information in order to create their respective products. When trying to interpret our dreams, our limited conscious knowledge is often meager compared to the amount of information condensed in a dream. What would happen if the computer's information processing ability were put into the service of helping us understand the information the dream has processed?

Everything described in the above imaginary scenario is possible, either now or with computer systems of the not-so-distant future. Working toward this future, I have been administering a far-reaching program called the "Dream Net Project." Like the initiation of the space program, it is amibitous, requiring the coordination of many different component projects under development by many different people and should lead to many interesting beneficial spinoffs in the process. It certainly has some profound implications for networking among our community of dreamers. Even if the "Dream Net" project can not, for some years to come, yield the type of incredible results depicted in the above imaginary scenario, there are many useful things that today's personal computer can do to relieve some of the drudgery of dream collecting and analysis, both for a dreamer's personal use and for research purposes. For example, a dream journal wordprocessing and filing system would make it easier to write down dreams (it is easier on a word processor), to modify and manipulate the dream text in the process of written interpretive
work, and to store, sort, and retrieve past dreams that may be relevant to the dreamwork at hand. That much is quite possible today.

In fact, rudimentary versions of such a computer-aided "dream interpretation journal" have been constructed. These are rather simple tools that store your dreams by title and compile your "dream symbol dictionary" from information you provide. The interpretation routine is based on a simple "symbol definiton substitution" method, prompting you to define your symbols, then substituting your definitions for the symbols in your dream, giving you a very rough "interpreted" dream text. If you have a "communications device" (a modem), instruct your computer to call 1-303-722-6210 and you can play with this symbol substitution "dream interpreter" routine. When you call in, select the "Dream Net" menu. Here you will find, besides the dream "interpreter," many other items of interest to dreamers. It contains my initial attempts to introduce the dream community to on-line computer networking. This service is part of a larger computer network system called "Parapsychological Information Network" (for more information about P.I.N. and its newsletter, write to William Tedder, P.I.N. Systems Operator, P.O. Box 10456, Denver, CO 80210).

At this particular point in time, I am working to develop a more useful filing and retrieval system for personal dream collections. Currently, the only commercially available "data-base" program that seems suitable is the rather expensive program called "Sci-Mate Personal Text File Manager." Its "bit-mapped" memory system allows you to retrieve all stored dreams that contain the word, or words, you specify. As I make contact with more dreamers who are computer specialists, I hope to be able to de-
velop a less expensive dream filing system that incorporates this amazing feature.

Being able to work with large files of dreams becomes especially important when dreamers wish to learn from one another, as in group projects or in research. In the Sundance Journals I began a rather tedious project called "The Book of Dreams." Its goal is to gather collections of dreams and organize them around particular symbols. You will be able to look up "snake" in the "Book" and read many different dreams involving snakes and get some idea about how snakes behave in dreams. This information could help you determine the meaning of your snake's appearance in your dream. The experts on symbology whom we respect -- such as Carl Jung or Joseph Campbell -- are essentially historians of mankind's symbolic output. One way these experts answer a question such as, "what is the meaning of 'snake' in a dream?" is to present many different dreams, stories, and legends in which a snake appears. I have boxes of dream collections sent to me by people responding to the original announcement concerning "The Book of Dreams." With access to computers, it is now a reasonable task to begin entering and compiling these dreams. I am now interested in locating other persons who are interested in contributing dreams to this collection, or in other ways helping to work on the project. As the "Book of Dreams" develops, printed versions will be made available, although the ultimate use of the collection will be to store over a million dreams on a computer for instant access by the dreamer.

The original "Sundance Experiment" concerned the emerging apocalyptic imagery in dreams, and attempted to integrate these dream themes in search of an emerging "New Age" mythology. Today there have been several
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_31_b9d223271f928d4d1f7cg-03.jpg?height=736&width=1946&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=76)
attempts to stimuate a group to dream about a particular topic. It is difficult to process the information in these dreams, to determine what themes the group dreams have in common, to what extent such themes might be expected by chance, and to pinpoint group dream themes that are suggestive of a transpersonal or psychic connection. It was this particular problem that stimulated me to begin the "Dream Net Project."

The method of "content analysis," developed by Calvin Hall and Robert Van de Castle, is a useful tool for analysing dream series or large groups of dreams for certain themes. It has facilitated dream research in many ways, and it has the unique advantage of being "theory free." George Baylor, at the University of Montreal, has created a compu-ter-aided content analysis program on a large, main-frame computer. His work may be helpful in developing a personal computer version that would prompt the individual dreamer in content analysing a series of dreams. It would also facilitate the content analysis of the results of a group dream experiment, such as the "Dream Helper Ceremony" devised by Bob Van de Castle and myself (see Omni Magazine, Decem ber, 1983).

This particular group dream
dreamers who attempt to have telepathic dreams of healing and guidance for a target person whose problems are unknown to the dreamers. A computer-aided content analysis program, coupled with a large collection of dreams, would be able to show what themes are emerging in the dream helpers' dreams and whether or not such a focus of dream themes would be expected in a random sample of dreams. This system could also be used to compare the group's dream themes with other group's dream themes to show that this particular group of dream helpers are focusing on a narrow target topic. This particular application of computer-assisted dream interpretation is the one that I am most interested in at this particular point in time as I believe that it will help to focus more attention upon the "paradigm-smashing" potential of group dreaming.

One of the spinoffs of working on such a project is that creating a computerized dream interpretation program requires you to examine your assumptions about how dreams are to be interpreted. To clarify my own thinking about the processes involved in interpreting a dream, I developed a "programmed workbook" for dream interpretation. Entitled Dream Realizations, it leads the user through a 28-day period of
experiment involves a group of dream recording, dream interpretation through journal writing, and daily application to problemsolving. It is an attempt to lay out a "program" (although no computer is involved) of creative problem-solving using dream interpretation as the major source of inspiration. In testing this workbook with hundreds of others, I have found that the majority of users report favorable and exciting results that fit their own needs. Such results show that a "programmatic" approach to dreamwork doesn't necessarily have the pitfalls you might imagine. It does seem possible to develop instructional material for dreamwork that is capable of being adapted to the computer.

If you find yourself interested in any of the topics mentioned in this article, if you want to keep posted on developments and to learn how you might participate in this project, send me your name and address. This next June (20-23) at the 2nd Annual Conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams, which will be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, I will be organizing a "Special Interest Group on Dreams and Computers." I hope to meet you there where we can all exchange notes on this topic.

## PRECOGNITIVE DREAMS

by<br>Marcia Rose Emery

I awoke, my heart beating rapidly, heavy beads of perspiration on my face; even catching my breath was difficult. I looked around my bedroom for some trace of reality, something to tell me I was safely at home and not frantically running to catch a connecting flight at the airport. In my dream I had lost my luggage and missed my flight. I couldn't help wonder what connection existed between the dream and my coming flight later that morning. I dismissed it as a nightmare. Several hours later, however, the nightmare became reality when I missed a connecting flight because the plane was three hours late. I had to rush to another airline, catching a flight with a minute and half to spare. As in the dream, my luggage was lost.

There are many examples of "dreams that come true" in my life. One time I dreamed of the theft of my red pocketbook. Days later, the pocketbook was stolen, with my wallet, keys, and new prescription glasses. If I'd paid attention to the dream, perhaps I could have taken steps to prevent the loss.

For some time now I've been recording my dreams, and my "dream book" is filled with many warnings and glimpses of future events that came true. I am still amazed at how this information comes to me, outside the realm of the known five senses.

These premonitory dreams, going forward in time to provide a glimpse of future events, are called "precognitive dreams." You can train yourself to be receptive to this "inside information" as your dreams provide warnings as well as signal more pleasant events.

My first precognitive dream
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_31_b9d223271f928d4d1f7cg-04.jpg?height=714&width=1280&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=780)
was startling and overwhelming. Knowing that I was in my bedroom and not in the middle of a car accident after my brakes failed, took only a few moments, but experientially it felt like a life time. I had been teaching on the college level and was very much immersed in my students and extra-curricular dance activities. I look back and describe myself at that time as a "straight psychology professor" having no knowledge of metaphysical events or higher consciousness studies. I was always taught that dreams went backward to reveal repressed sexual and aggressive impulses. Nowhere did I ever learn of a dream going forwrd in time to provide glimpses of future events. In fact, when I awoke from my accident dream, I looked at the car crash symbolically and wondered why I was trying to hurt or punish myself with such a violent action. Can you imagine my surprise, when I experienced the car accident three weeks later, in exact detail, as my brakes did indeed fail? This dream was the first of many informal lessons to follow.

Weeks after this spectacular car crash, I dreamed of another accident with brakes failing. Of course, this was ridiculous since I had purchased a brand new car to replace the totalled wreck.

This time, sound effects were added to the dream as I heard a snap when I put my foot down on the brake. Again, wondering about my punitive gesture toward myself, I dismissed the dream since this couldn't possibly happen to a brand new car. Again, the inside information was correct, as the brake cable snapped just days later. Finally, I started keeping a dreambook to scope future events and be wiser by meeting impending situations with forewarning.

For me, precognitive dreams are characterized by their crystal clear quality. When I awake, it is most difficult to tell the difference between the dream and reality. The bewildered feeling leads one to cry out and ask, "Is this scene for real?" When this happens, train yourself to look around the bedroom to note the clock or some part of the room that reminds you where you are. Perhaps the strongest advice I can give is don't run to a dream book when you have such a clear dream. Your first responsiblity is to record the contents in your own dream book. The symbolism that comes through is not only private but meant for you. You are truly the best interpreter and expert for your dreams. Many people have overlooked the vital warning or message that was telegraphed
in advanced because their heads were tucked in some dream book looking up symbols that did not apply. The precognitive dream will be presented to you either as a literal picture or as a symbolic representation that needs decoding. As you receive "inside information" about forthcoming events, you will learn to rapidly intuit the significance of the precognitive dream.

For months I dreamt of a man named Leo, an acquaintance through my meditation group. In the dream we seemed loving and warm. Yet in reality we were "just friends" and social intimacy had never been suggested. Leo was a construction worker, tall, blond and a Pisces like myself. After the first series of dreams, I met another tall blond Pisces man I started dating. Obviously Leo precogitively signaled the new man in my life. Well, Leo came to the fore to signal two more relationships, each a very karmic attachment that bore some resemblance to Leo. The last dream about Leo signaled a dramatic event: 1 met my husband three days later and no longer dreamed of Leo. The point is that anyone can appear in a dream and we have to consider characteristics of the person symbolically such as their name, physical appearance, zodiac sign or profession. There is a clue somewhere, heralding the imminent appearance of such a person in your life.

Your dreams will become your private theater for previewing forthcoming events. As in the phrase "for better or worse" we know that omens can be both positive and negative.

Set yourself up to receive this invaluable inside information by first daring to believe you can get a sneak preview of forth coming events. Ask specific questions during your morning or evening meditation periods, and watch the answer surface in your dream drama over the next
few days. Keep a pad and pencil by your bed for recording the inital impressions. The literal precognitive dream will be easily identified by its clarity and the relevance to your current affairs.

Symbolically, tease out the meanings through the amplification technique initially suggested by Carl Jung. Each time you arrive at an association with the central symbol, go back to form another association. For example, the flaming red cape presents itself and 1 amplify it to associate it with the theater, and then go back again to relate the cape to a magic carpet and once again, return to the cape to see it associated with physical sexual overtones. We can also apply Freud's word association, as one word or thought triggers another until the "real meaning" stands out. Gestalt adherents would suggest role playing each symbol until some insight is achieved.

With practice, you will become the best detective finding clues in your dreams. During one dream I saw myself getting of $f$ an elevator on the tenth floor. Not surprisingly, on the tenth of the month I received "uplifting" news by way of recognition for my professional work!

You will be given a wealth of information to help you make better decisions in your business and personal life. Simply stay tuned to your inside channel presenting information though precognitive dreams. The only dream file I now keep is titled, "Dreams I will always respect and acknowledge."

## WORKING WITH YOUR DREAMS

by Ruthann Forbes

Recurring dreams have held a fascination for me for a long time. In some cases I have found that they occur because of a flaw in our attitude that prevents us from responding properly or completely to an emotional experience. And when we are confronted over and over again to similar situations over a period of days, months or even years, we continue to think and react in old patterns. Therefore it may be that we are presented with these recurring dreams to show us areas of our life that need to be worked on so that we can develop more fully to our inner potential.

I used to have a recurring nightmare which began in my early childhood and continued until I was twenty-seven years old. The dream started out with me walking along a path until it led me to a secluded log cabin restaurant, nestled in the side of a mountain. I sat down at one of the wooden tables and found a small silver knife; fork, and spoon set before me. Things change quickly in dreams, and suddenly I found myself standing alone in broad daylight on a strange street. Disconsolation filled me with such unrest that 1 began to run up the street, trying frantically to search for the right house. Finally I ran into a white house and walked toward the back screen door. In the back yard was a vegetable garden. Under the facade of this pleasant looking garden, I knew that something was dead and buried there. It was at this point that I woke up. Having never before seen the garden in any of my other dreams, I knew it was highly significant.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_31_b9d223271f928d4d1f7cg-06.jpg?height=394&width=1302&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=89)

The next day I tried to put the dream out of my mind, so I went shopping. I was walking toward a newspaper store when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw animals for sale in the window of a shop. All of a sudden a brilliant flash of light burst into my consciousness. For a few minutes this all-encompassing, blazing light, remained, temporarily blinding me. For the next few moments I could actually see and experience myself as a four year old child again. My pet had been killed and none of the adults around would listen to me. I could actually feel the fear and remorse again that $I$ had experienced as a child. This traumatic incident of my pet being killed had been erased completley from my conscious awareness up until this point in my life. In my case, the recurring dream was caused by hidden emotions that stemmed from an early childhood event that I was no longer consciously aware of. If I had been into the study of dreams then, as I have been for the past nine years, I could have used various techniques of interpreting the dream and working with it in order to being about more immediate results than waiting around years to have it solved.

Many people feel, as I do, that the average dreamer is perfectly capable of interpreting his own dreams. The dream imagery is created by his own mind. They are his own symbols collected over many years of living, and with a little effort he should be able to understand his dreams.

Over the years I have worked through a number of recurring dreams for both myself and my students. In preparation for dream work, write down your dream and any insights you may have on it. Then write down the days occurrences to pinpoint any conflict areas in your life. Any one of the following methods of interpreting dreams can be used separately or combined in order to understand dreams.

1. Is the dream symbolic or literal? Can it be applied to thoughts, words, or activities that have occured recently?
2. Decode any major symbols by asking yourself "What does this symbol mean to me?" After decoding the symbols then reread the dream with the new definitions in place of the symbols.
3. Is there a message or lesson in the dream? Look at the dream objectively and ask questions like "why," or "what" can I learn from this experience.
4. Relate the feelings that were experienced in the dream to that of a real life situation that has occurred recently. Ask yourself "What and under what circumstances have I had this same feeling?"
5. Have a dialogue between yourself and one or more of the dream symbols. This can be done in your imagination or written out on paper.
6. Draw your dream. Allow the subconscious to express itself through a drawing and take notice of anything you may have overlooked in the dream.
7. Ask for another dream that will give insight into the
reason for the nightmare. You can either program the subconscious by a presleep suggestion that you will have a clarifying dream or you can use prayer. The answer doesn't always come in a dream but it can also come spontaneously as inspiration during the day.
8. Discuss your dream with a partner to gain added insights.
9. Confront and conquer fearful enemies or situations within a dream. Try to train yourself to do this by using a conscious suggestion repeated to yourself during the day. This will help you to respond better when having a dream. You can also ask the dream enemy for a gift once you conquer him.
10. Rewrite the dream, bringing it to a positive outcome thereby dealing with the dream on its own level.

After you have done one or more of the methods above, review your dream and record any insights. Also, make your own dream dictionary by collecting and recording the meanings of your symbols. These are just some of the methods that are easy and not too time consuming for the average person to use when working with a dream.

I would be interested in hearing from other people who have had a similar experience of a blinding light either within a dream or consciously, and what discoveries they may have made in their life from their experience. This is an area that I would like to do some research on. Please write me:

## DREAMS

## Stase Michaels

Learning to analyze dreams is like learning to ride a bicycle. Someone can tell you about types of bicycles and what riding feels like, but if you sit on the bike and pedal you get your balance quickly without theory. In the same way, by recording your dreams and beginning to notice patterns, you begin to understand your dreams by experience, as a legitimate method of learning dream analysis.

Dreams are the tools our psyches have at their disposal to be able to lead life in a more stable way. We have external tools such as cars, and physical tools such as hands, and similarily dreams are a natural tool of the psyche for understanding ourselves. Just as any average person can learn to drive a car, so can most people learn how to use dreams as a form of selfcounseling, to "get around" more easily and comfortably in life.

We can compare dream analysis to nutrition, keeping in mind that just a few hundred years ago, people died from scurvy because they didn't know that eating fresh fruit provides vita$\min C$ which prevents scurvy. Yet nowadays any school child can tell you about vitamins and what a well-balanced diet consists of and as a result, we tend to have much healtheir bodies than did our ancestors of a few hundred years ago. In the same way, we now have enough knowledge and experience with dream-analysis for it to be accessible to most people. Not everyone becomes a Dream Analyst, or expert, yet anyone can learn to monitor themselves via dreams in terms of emotions, talents, and effective decision-making.

Dreams are not a way to avoid personal growth, or bypass struggles and challenges in life, nor do they provide shortcuts. Instead, they help to define problems more clearly by pointing out causes and showing ways to meet problems more constructively. The responsiblity, however, is still in your hands to take insights and apply them in a practical and consistent way in everyday life.

For example, if you feel the pinch financially, dreams won't provide the number of a winning lottery ticket as a way of solving financial needs and desire; but they can help zero in on talents that are perhaps lying dormant and that could be used to increase earnings. [See John Perkins' article in the DNB, SeptOct. 1984, for a different point of view.--The Editors] Or dreams can help us if earnings are hampered by personality traits. For example, if someone is bad-tempered and can't get along with colleagues, dreams can help turn this trait around so the person will earn more due to more constructive attitudes and actions.

Nor will dreams tell you how to change your boss, your spouse, or that in-law who is a thorn in your side. Instead, they help you work on your own attitude so relationships improve as a result of personal growth. An important ground rule is that dreams, first and foremost, work on yourself -to change yourself constructively -- not others. Yet, like a tuning fork effect, if you become more effective and whole, those around you automatically begin to change in that direction too.

There is a wider promise hinted at in dreams, as well, if you do work consistently and have the intention of using dreams as a tool for self-growth and help for others. At an advanced level dreams can be a source of help to others and can help consolidate creative ideas, such as they did for Singer, whose breakthrough for the sewing machine came through a dream, and for Daniel DeFoe who saw the outline for Robinson Crusoe in a dream. These other levels are available to us too after we put emotions and talents to use in a stable, wellrounded, and practical way. Then, when we are motivated to helping others, wider horizons are available through dreams.

One of the most important functions of dreams is to deal with emotions. Dreams mirror the emotions we are experiencing. They also create emotions to bring about change. For example: a dream frightens you -- but makes you look at yourself and your life in a way that shocks you into a more constructive path or attitude. Like a thermometer, dreams tells us if we mis-handle feelings, or have to little or too much of one or another.

During the day, our minds record everything: emotions, actions, reactions, everything going on externally as well as internally. But our attention rarely has time to sift the relevance of it all during the day. So while we sleep, our brain scans this recent input and compares it to our "master file" -that is, the permanent record or our overall goals, standards and kinds of feelings we strive for. Dreams then play back summaries of this comparison and give feedback showing us whether these recent actions and attitudes are bringing us closer to or farther away from our real goals and "balanced" selves. Because dreams are a summary-report system drawn from the total information we have stored in our
brains, they can help with decisions, providing data we may have overlooked during our waking state.

Notice that our minds compare this new daily input with personal standards -- not those of relatives or society. In light of this sort of feedback, it is helpful to ask what goals and standards you are consciously working by and therefore unconsciously measuring yourself by through your dreams. You may reset these as often as your wish or keep them the same.

Sigmund Freud was not the first to study dreams within the scientific community. But he was the first to identify the subconscious as the storage compartment of memories and desires -- and one of the first in modern times to investigate dreams as linked to daily activities and motives that reflected the psyche's contents. Thus he revived the idea accepted by the ancients that dream content is linked to our waking life.

A major breakthrough in understanding the processes of dreams came with the work of Professor Nathaniel Kleitman, a physiologist at the University of Chicago, who set up a "sleep laboratory." In 1952 he noticed that as a person slept, the eyes sometimes moved rapidly back and forth as though the sleeping person was watching a tennis match or a movie with the eyes close. He called this "Rapid Eye Movement," or "REM sleep" for short, and thought this might indicate that a person was dreaming. Later studies confirmed this and revolutionized our scientific understanding of dreams by making it possible to monitor dreams accurately when they actually occured. Electrodes (tiny metal plates ) were attached to the eyes of a sleeping person and linked to graph paper, allowing Kleitman and his colleagues to tell when a dream began and when it ended.

Later research on content in dreams led to crucial observations: first, that dreams in one night are linked to themes related to activities or problems going on in waking life; and second, themes tend to be serious emotional statements, even if at first dream snatches appear to be light or insignificant.

Personally, I believe life is an eternal spiritual journey. By constructively meeting daily obstacles and challenges and developing talents, we attain some sort of growth and "wholeness." I believe there are spiritual and universal laws to live by which are as real as the physical laws. Just as there is a law assuring that anyone who touches fire under normal circumstances will get burned, whether or not they know about fire, so are there equally real spiritual laws.

I believe dreams are a monitoring system, stemming from the soul (if one wants to look that far inwards) to help us through the concrete, here and now part of this journey. One doesn't have to subscribe to spiritual beliefs to get benefit from dreams, but my perspective is one enunciated by psychologist Carl Jung, my first mentor in dream analysis. He used dream analysis as well as astrology in his personal life and with his patients (a fact confirmed to me personally in a letter from his daughter), and following his experience, I do the same. Also, I accept each of us as a unique individual, like a snowflake, with talents and purposes no one else can fulfill as well in the place and time we find ourselves. Like notes in a symphony -- we need to express our uniqueness in cooperation with the whole, for the good of the whole and for our personal satisfaction. And dreams help us do so.

Using this technique, scientists were able to see that people do dream every night, whether or not they remember their
dreams. In fact we dream like clockwork every hour and a half for a total time of $20 \%$ (or 90 minutes) on an average night of sleep. A dream lasts from 10-30 minutes and tends to be longest and clearest just before waking up.

Dream researchers William Dement and Charles Fisher of New York's Mount Sinai Hospital were the first to show that we sleep in order to dream, not for physical rest alone. In their "dream deprivation" experiments, subjects were awakened whenever a dream began and were not permitted to go through with the dream. No dreams were allowed for up to six nights, nor were subjects allowed to nap during the day. In their waking lives these subjects became more and more anxious and irritable, and their judgment in decisions became poor and less in accord with standards they would normally have. Subjects drank more, smoked more, and overall showed more and more hositlity, resentment, and disintegration of the personality.

Another group of subjects was kept awake for the same amount of time, but during a nondreaming portion of sleep. They showed no change in personality or behavior. This showed clearly that the purpose of sleep is related to dreams, which are in themselves related to emotional and psychological stability and well-being.

## Striving For Acceptance

I am a cabinetmaker/freelance writer, and teach a course in dream interpretation here in Orlando, Florida. I feel confident about the course I have put together, but was at a loss as to how to let the public know about its existence. Then, I had the following dream:
"I receive a call from a young woman about a woodworking job. Upon arriving, I find that she is remarkably beautiful and her home is a delight to the senses. It is filled with shiny mechanical sculptures of all types and colors. Most beautiful of all are dozens of live tropical fish in every color imaginable, which "swim" in the air all about the house, about a foot above the floor.

The young woman is a psychologist, and I find myself going to great lengths to impress her with my intellect, though she seems cold and unfeeling. The only acceptance I gain is from her next door neighbor, who developes genuine respect for my earnestness.

After failing in all attempts to win the trust and acceptance of the young beauty, I feel it is time to leave. As I do, I notice that her mechanical sculptures are much noisier than I had first noticed, and her skin now seems unnaturally white. Only the mult-colored fish are as beautiful as they had first seemed. One even comes close enough for me to touch before I leave.

Once outside, I see a bus just loading to leave. I encounter great difficulty in trying to catch it, and finally decide to let it go and wait for one at a more relaxed pace. As soon as I decide it isn't worth the effort, there is a delay, and I find myself able to board the early bus"

1 interpreted the dream as outlined below:
Beautiful woman= the part of me placing beautiful appearances and social prestige at top priority, feeling those things are powerful.
Tropical fish $=$ the natural, intuitive part of me.
Struggling to catch the bus= wanting to acheive social prestige now; not wanting to wait, yet deciding that it's not worth the effort.
Message:
This evaluative dream reflects my heart's perception that I'm "putting on airs" in an unsuccessful attempt to be accepted into the glamorous world of beautiful appearances and social prestige. I decide that such acceptance is not worth the effort, for surface beauty and social prestige are illusive and short-lived pleasures, The only true beauty is that of the authentic and flowing intuitive creature within, which strives to impress no one. Surprisingly, however, just as I decide that struggling to "catch the early bus to fame and fortune" isn't worth the effort, I find myself able to easily board it.

I finished this interpretation at 4 pm , and at $6: 30 \mathrm{pm}$, I actually received a call from the "beautiful young anchorwoman" on the channel 9 news, requesting an interview about the dream class. As I left in the morning for the television station, I reflected on my unsuccessful dream efforts
to impress her with my "intel-
lect", and reminded myself to relax and meditate, so that viewers could see that I'm earnest, at least.

When I arrived, I watched the young woman and the weatherman on the monitor while I waited to be introduced. Entering the studio, I was confronted with the blatant illusion of television. The TV monitor showed the weatherman pointing to a map of the U.S., when in fact it was trick photography and he was simply pointing to a blank wall. The heavy make -up required for television cast a whitish hue on the young woman's face, and though I'm sure that off-camera she is a genuine and caring individual, her role as anchorwoman required her to elimiate all expression of emotion while we talked. During the interview, I felt comfortable and unpretentious, occasionally reminding myself to play no roles to win acceptance.

The anchorwoman expressed no further interest in the class, but I received a call the same day from another young woman at a radio station (radio being the "neighbor" of television?). She expressed respect for what I was doing and not only requested a radio interview, but signed up for the class herself.

Hopefully, the broadcasts will lead a few individuals to touch the intuitive and beautiful creatures within themselves.

## EDITORIAL

It is a cold，windy day in Brooklyn as I write this．My dreams this morning remain in the back of my mind，unwritten and unfortunately，soon to be forgotten．But I know that if I took the time to write them down in my journal that new and myster－ ious possibilities might emerge from that effort．It is a small effort that yields big rewards．Last night I dreamt of a high resolution computor monitor，which meant to me that I＇m looking for a high degree of＂resolution＂in my activities，in which the DNB plays a major part．

The Bulletin has finally been edited，formatted，and laid out on the paste－up boards．Dale has done her last illustration and our weekly dream group has had a chance to look the text over for mistakes．I＇m sure there are a few errors we missed．It seems a good issue to me．There is sharing going on from all levels of dreamwork．Each issue is an attempt to speak to those levels，so you will find very different perceptions side by side．

I have been publisher／editor of DNB for a full year now．It has been one of the most rewarding yet emotionally tiring exper－ iences I＇ve had．Some days I wake up thrilled to be a part of this movement toward self－awarenesss through dreams and other weeks when the subscriptions trickle in like molasses I get discouraged and wonder how to pay the printer and post office．I then feel lonely and wonder if DNB is important enough to the readers to help get more subscriptions through friends，gift subscriptions to family，or in feedback through letters and sharing．This is not a pyramidal hiearchy like many publica－ tions．We are a network and depend on a high level of commit－ tment and communication from those participating．Articles， letters，contacts，poetry．．．these all come from you．The editors don＇t go hunting this stuff up to fill in the spaces between slick ads．

One way you can truly help is to resubscribe without me nagging you．Check your label and note the four numbers on the upper right． 0984 means your subscription is due on August＇ 84. 0784 means July＇84，and so on．It＇s a hassle to have to send out a lot of little reminders．Remember，you can resubscribe before your sub is overdue and the remaining time will be cred－ ited accordingly．

My usual exhortation：share，share，share！No＂dreamland diploma＂is required，as Lynn Hallam（page 17）thought．If you are an isolated dreamer who wants to join or start a group，send in your name and address and we＇ll put your name in the Dream Calendar and crank up Little Blue，our computor，to see who is in your area．If you already are in a group，we＇d love to hear about it，even if you＇re closed to new members．Your experiences are invaluable to others who feel more tentative and need a confidence boost．

Edith Gilmore will be regularly reviewing books starting next issue．We will be featuring an an article by Jeremy Taylor， whose book I highly reccommend：Dreamwork，published by Paullist Press．It not only has the best bibliograpy but is the most dedicated to non－professional dreamwork that I＇ve seen in years． He is committed to his work and the reader feels inspired．Look
for a review soon. Also recommended is Stillpoint Press, a small publisher of spiritual books from New Hampshire in my old stomping grounds. An excellent selection is available through their catalog. Write:

We are also getting our own book list together. If you don't find one in this issue, look for it soon or write for one.

Here's a dream I had recently:
"I am helping a man with an underwater project. There are some cages that need to be disassembled and brought to the surface. A hysterical woman has tried but was unable to bring them up. Without asking anyone, 1 strip to my underwear, grab a mask and snorkel and dive in. The water extends under the land. The "cages" aren't deep (they are valuable) and the job is easy. I relish the challenge and can hold my breath for a long time. A dog-companion is underwater with me. I successfully disconnect the cages from one another and they're salvaged"

What this dream meant to me is that I have an ability to solve emotional problems by examining and taking apart old feelings of negative control (cages). The unconscious, or water, can be entered with confidence and success. The hysterical woman is my own tendency to "flip out" when problems arise, but my dream self easily takes matters in hand. The cages are valuable because of the insights they offer when raised to the surface, brought to waking awareness to be consciously examined much like an archeological dig reveals the lives of ancient inhabitants.

The day I had this dream I was full of confident excitement and anticipation, though 1 didn't know why. I realized after reflecting on the dream and discussing it with Dale that I had been avoiding looking at some personal problems connected with my past because of the emotions involved. But it turns out the self-examination was successful and fun as well. My "dog companion" is particularly touching. He was there to support me and have fun too!

There are times when I forget to do dreamwork and think that I can solve my problems simply by thinking about them intellectually. The result is the "hysterical woman." Entering the undewater world of my unconscious, where my patterns and feelings are laid out in story-fashion, is the best way to take care of personal problems. The only impediment is fear of the unknown and procrastination. The best attitude (for me) is one of "damn the torpedoes" and diving in.

In waking life I don't have nearly that level of confidence. My dream mind is a fearless explorer, eager to help. If only I might heed the message: Confidence furthers success. May you also have such pleasureable adventures! Chris Hudson

## DREAMS COME TRUE

On August 3, 1972, I auditioned as an actress for the producers of four CBS-TV soap operas.

On October 12, 1972, I dreamed:
"I was offered a part on 'Love ls A Many Splendored Thing' on CBS-TV. When I appeared for the show, I was told I was at the wrong door and would have to go to the other one. Arriving at the second door, I realized no one knew who I was or where I could find the staff and crew of the show. They demanded I identify myself. I told them this was my first day and that I had not yet received an ID card. I broke away and began running through several hallways trying to locate the right place. I felt desparate because I knew I was late."

I interpreted this dream as meaning that, for me, pursuing a career in a soap opera was "knocking at the wrong door," and that if I persisted, I would encounter confision and frustration in trying to find "my right place." I was amazed when the following events unfolded:

On November 3, 1972, I received a call from CBS and was offered a principal role on "Love is a Many Splendored Thingn (LIAMST). I was advised to join AFTRA (television union) immediately because this was a major part and could turn into a longrunning role.

On November 14, 1972, I appeared at CBS for my first rehearsal. New York City was experiencing its second disastrous rainstorm in one week. The cab let me out at the corner. l struggled across the street, shielding myself with an umbrella. I looked up as I approached the door. Men with picket signs cont. on pg. 14

(Later I was told that CBS-TV engineers had been on strike for months, and vandalism of major equipment had taken place the preceding evening. Police had been put on guard everywhere.) I ran through the rain to the second door. When I entered, police and uniformed gaurds blocked me, demanding my identification card. I told them this was my first day and I didn't have one. I began to feel desperate about being late. When the guards became distracted, I sneaked through in the confusion and went to the LIAMST of fice. No one was there. I wandered the hallways for 10 minutes before I could locate someone with directions to the studio. All the employees were standing in as engineers and no one was in the offices.

The rehearsel and the next day's taping were chaos. I was new and naive as to what to do or where to go for costumes and make-up. No one was available to advise me because the production assistants were manning the cameras. I was not called back after the first performansce, and the show iteslf was cancelled by CBS and went off the air in February, 1973.

Having grown up in a family that had frequent precognitive dreams, I wasn't surprised that the dream came true, but I was stunned by the accuracy of the details. This was probably the most exact duplication of reality I'd ever experienced in a dream. Also, my initial interpretation turned out to be a foretelling...soap operas were definitely a "wrong door" for me at that time.

1 want to share a tip with your readers. During sleep, say, 6 hours into it, people normally become semi-conscious off and on until they get up. It is at this time that I try to influence my dream content or mood. When I awaken, I remember that it's a good time to do this so I think of a pleasing subject or situation or simply say to myself, "I'm so very happy, I'm going to have a fantastic dream!" This may seem difficult at first but if anyone is as interested and enjoying their dreams as I do, then they will catch on in time. This usually works for me, producing a dream or two that leave me happy and satisfied when I awaken. What do you think of this?

I feel I do have a vivid imagination and have eventful dreams every night. I did write some down at one time, but since stopped. I do collect details, images, pictures and perceptions and try to make sense of it all. Being stationed in West Germany, I don't know of any dream groups here.

I'd like to share some of my dreams once I get some some down on paper. I should start doing that, correct? Most of my dreams I'm so involved in what's going on that the colors do not leave much of an impression -- does anybody have a theory on this?

[I'd recommend writing your dreams down as often as you like. Sometimes one dream a week is plenty to work with, while some people write down 3 a night! 1 personally need to write my dreams down or 1 forget them. I recommend Stase Michael's little book (see her article). I'm sure there are at least a dozen theories about the color thing. Theorists, please write to Gale...C]

Dear Editor, I have hesitated writing you about this dream which I had about two years ago, but am responding to your request for "shares". Please sign my name with initials only, because the dream is really unbelievable, to most people at least. I had this dream on a Friday night in May, while preparing for a major vacation trip. " 1 am standing alone in a rural area, and am approached by a middle-aged man, a stranger, who says to me, 'Go to the track and bet on Gato del Sol.'"

The following morning I was sitting with my travelling companion at a coffee shop. I did not recall having the dream. The radio in the shop announced that today was the Kentucky Derby. Suddenly, I remembered my race track dream. I told my friend and together we opened The NY Times to see who was running in the race. Sure enough, listed far down on the entrants list was Gato del Sol. A longshot, odds against his win-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_31_b9d223271f928d4d1f7cg-15.jpg?height=475&width=649&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=109)
ning were about 19 to 1 . Still, the feeling was eerie, and my friend and I decided we had better bet on this particular race. (Neither of us follows the horses and we knew nothing about this particular Derby). I went to the OTB where I was told that it would not be possible to bet on the Derby in New York State. I even asked at the coffee shop for names of local bookies but they laughed at me. I couldn't bet on the race, but $I$ did watch it later that afternoon. Gato del Sol trailed for the entire race, and then, at the very end, in the stretch, he edged ahead and won.

I certainly cannot explain this dream, and to tell the truth, I am not particularly interested in rational explanations -- the dream and subsequent events were very powerful. I have had other premonition dreams but nothing this dramatic. In addition, this is the first dream in which a stranger approaches me with information about the future. In other dreams, I just "know" what the information is.

I recently received your sample issue [samples are available for \$2...Editors] and I must say I was delighted! Finally a publication dealing exclusively with dreams and the mystique that surrounds them. I believe dreams are as varied as the people who have them.
[ find that many people my
age (almost 20, enrolled in a large university) have disturbing dreams. I find myself having excessively violent dreams. I find myself committing atrocities beyond belief, but it's always legal. the violence takes place in self-defense or wartime. What's even more threatening is the fact that I always remember the majority of my "nocturnal cognitions".

I've run across others with the same graphically violent dreams. I believe this phenomenon is largely due to the pressures placed on "kids" in college. A lot of people my age really believe when it's time to get out there in the "real world" we're going to have to step on some faces to make it to the top, thus you can see the correlation to the dreams.

Another theory of mine is the effect of broken families of children. Many of my friends, myself included, come from broken homes. All of us took our situations very well. (I can't even remember crying from the actual confrontation). These types of situations have a deep effect on the minds of those involved. I never thought it bothered me, but as I get older I'm realizing it did have a profound impact onme.

I am interested in correspondence with anyone that might be interested in this. I'm seeking any input from anyone! Thank you.

[We get many letters from young people seeking dialogue about distressing dreams. Would you consider dropping Jason a line of sharing/encouragement?....Editors]

Recently I received the Oct/Nov issue and I read it as though I were starved! It's like attending a dream group meeting/gathering. I get all charged up and usually remember more dreams than I do a month later.

I would like to share a dream experience. Periodically, I review my dreams to gather new insights, etc. In doing this I noticed a trend: certain symbols and "2-3" images were occuring in an unusual cycle. Because of their nature I suspected a connection with my menstrual cycle. So I went back and matched dream dates of these particular images with dates of my period. These images generally occured 4-5 days prior to the first day of my period. I would like to know if any other women have noticed a similar trend/cycle of images in their dreams. Thanks.

I am currently working on an article on dream modification arising from dream practical experiments in the last few years. Also I have an honors student doing a study of dreams of postnatal patients who are still in the hospital after giving birth.

Margaret King-Boyes, an anthroplologist who is married to an Aboriginal Witchdoctor here in South Australia spoke to our psychology department at a staff seminar a few years ago. The part of her talk I remember best is an anecdote:

A few months after her mother died she received a traditional aboriginal "mourning stick" from her husband who was living a thousand miles away and had it sent to her. When she later saw him she asked how he knew her mother had died. He said that he was sitting one evening when a cloud came over the morning star and a raindrop fell. (Her name in the aboriginal dialect means Morning Star.) She asked, "How did you know it was my mother? He replied, "A raindrop would not fall for anything less than a mother."

Ten minutes past twelve on a sunday evening most people are riddled
by each other's dreams. A large hawk descends into my memory
with black wings and a gibblet stolen in silence above
a night stream inhabited by trout
in the excess of Spring. Monday
curves this way, that way, up and over the imaginary time-piece
that snap-shots, paces
what I need or wish to see.
1 am repeated a billion times, few hear the pulse, the beam. lam
entering the mirror's doubles, the condensed tissue of the dream.
everywhere the highway to eachother is incomplete. Trees stick,
plug the air with sterile seed. O more than the sun is missing.
II.

It is now twelve and twenty, seconds are clipping
through my tiger-eye watchface
I bought in Luscern. Again
the commonplace paralyzes me.
Today everyone collapsed time
into nothing for an hour, Day light saving it's called, a relativity
conception without all the numbers. Einstein my trajectory is
off course. l'm headed for Dixie around 1862. A soldier is bleeding
in Shiloh, named Courtney or Court. He closes his eyes, collapses
his corpse. Eternity works him into a voice. Then chords survive, the air
is alive, a new born breaks into his lungs.

I am interested in corresponding with people interested in the following ideas:

1. ESP "signals" from others' lives (both past and present) that seem to intrude into a person's dreams.
2. Discarnate entities that may affect and intrude into our dreams.

Samuel Menahem (DNB, July/August issue) suggests that dreams are merely rehashing daily life and are there to offer solutions to our problems. I also think that "residual garbage" (for lack of a better word) of ten intrudes within dreams since many show simple rehashing of the dreamer's concerns. I also believe that other dream types occur.

1 suggest that if a person is empathetic he or she may pick up "signals in the noise" of everyday consciousness. I accept the theory of a life after death or of a parallel universe to ours. I believe that dreamers sometimes receive messages from such alternate realities.

Let me relate an example of one such dream. I dreamed I was within a small-framed woman's body (not mine) who was dressed in wealthy clothing. The woman was preoccupied with a collection of lavish and beautiful art deco furniture, vases, and jewelry. Water was flooding into her quarters and she was panicking. I knew she was on board a ship when I awoke.

Later I received further
dream information that the woman whose body I was "in" was named Miss Helga Nordstrum. The "information source" went on to inform me that my dream was associated with an actual historical event. In 1938, a German, Captain Kirk Vogler torpedoed the ship, while it was sailing off the coast of the Canary Islands. I have no way to check or verify this information. I wish someone would check this, because presently I am living with my husband in Asia and it is impossible for me to be in a dream study group. My husband is working in the Philippines but will be transferring to Okinawa in March. I would gladly correspond with anyone who is interested in these topics. I can be reached through this address:

I was gratified to see "Meditation $\mathrm{O}^{\prime \prime}$ so prominently displayed among the letters [see sept/oct issue]. My pleasure in reading it was slightly diminished, however, when 1 reached the last line. Unfortunately, the typist inserted "my" where no word was intended. This reverses the sense and destroys the meter. Would it be possible to note the correction in the next issue?

[Sorry, Mark. I typed your poem into our computor in the wee hours when I should've been dreaming instead of staring into a video monitor (plus I can't type for beans) and we skipped our "final proof"....Chris]

This last bulletin was definitely the first I have found to be more sharing than analytic. I mean, I actually understood everything in it. Deborah HilIman's article, in particular, was very helpful.

I've had one completely lucid dream as a result of visualizing a situation I wanted to change. I never actually fell asleep in my usual way but during the sudden dream that followed I found myself trying to button my shirt. I was aware that I couldn't really see what I was doing. I was observing myself trying to button so I told myself to open my eyes. When I did "open" my dreaming eyes, I was in a lucid state and there followed the most fantastic dream of my life.

Some 12 years ago, I dreamed that a maitre'd in a nightclub (how perfect) gave me a letter written by an Indian woman I went to school with. The letter was
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_31_b9d223271f928d4d1f7cg-17.jpg?height=890&width=636&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=796)
unreadable except for one line: "Although Werner Erhardt and the Tituca Indians don't actually say this, they believe: Open your eyes and dream." (Erhardt I had heard of but am still looking for the Tituca Indians). The only reference I have seen to opening one's eyes prior to lucidity was in "The Eagle's Gift" by Casteneda. Casteneda also writes about the eyes and intention, as well as describes in detail states of consciousness he experiences prior to lucidity.

I mention all this because of two things in the last DNB. One is Deborah's reference to bodily "feeling" and how she uses it as a means of holding onto lucidity, and the other was Chris' mentioning "hearing a voice" [editorial, sept/oct]. I have recently heard about NeuroLinguistic programming which is sort of a science of thought describing how people access internal information initially through either seeing pictures, hearing a voice, or feeling. In this world, I am very visual. What I see is my delight and beautiful things enthrall me. I feel certain that it is this sense dominance that I use to stimulate my lucidity because it
is my most comfortable and sophisticated sense. After reading about Chris' experience and Deborah's highly developed dreamstate, I wonder if Chris is very auditory and Deborah very "feely". Could these experiences be used as "triggers" for lucidity?

Hey, what do I know. I have wanted to participate in the DNB for a long time but truly felt like an ignoramus. I don't keep a dream journal and rarely even remember dreams. The DNB seemed so academic to me that I thought I needed a Dreamland Diploma just to write a letter. [ want to thank Chris for the remark he made asking Deborah "if that was a lucid dream" and the invitation to write. I realized he didn't have a dreamland diploma, either.

On top of this, if you can believe my audacity, I actually wrote a children's picture book about dreaming, even prior to having remembered a lucid dream. My little one was having scary dreams about a tiger. I couldn't find a book that actually told him how you deal with it, so I made one up. And it worked! He was able to turn the tiger into an ally and now and calls on the "tiger police" when he runs into other monsters. I am looking for a publisher. Thank you for listening.

[Lynn, when you get your book published, we'd love to help you sell it through DNB. As a matter of fact, I am a very auditory person, and though I can't speak for Deborah, she certainly is a deep feeling person. She will be presenting a follow-up to her Lucidity article in the issue following this one which is fascinating and may answer some of your questions. Stay tuned. Also, lucid dreaming is not a measure of "dream expertise", though they are generally more distinct and powerful in our memories...Chris]

## POEMS

by
Norma Churchill

## Grandmother Power

The long dead grandmother stood in the dream opened armed, clothed in power and beauty
My heart stood still to see her there
in bright kitchen where childhood's memory strung
Life's puzzle pieces together in jagged harmony of laughter and tears
The aunts were chatting playfully
and sun rays danced through glass french doors
I then, gliding like a summer sail, past stove
she used like an altar burning
Fire bright eyes darkly calling me to her embrace all loving
Grandmother power with transcending grace
sweeping me up into her mysterious strength
Melting one into the other now
I watch as her face becomes my own.

## Night Partner

In the void appeared a circle of misty light Whose boundaries brought forth the man Darkly handsome, container of Pluto's power Veiled light within the surrounding night

Speaking softly past my flesh, to the very bones
Containing soul, he said, I am Scorpio
The hum of his vocal chords fell over me
Like a magic net of spider silk
Cascading down like a bridal veil
Sparkling dewy jewels of the night
Drifting against me like a lover's embrace l, whose dark moon shadows his name.

Dream
Holy Rock up in the dark sky
Riding the moonstone disk of light
In outer space so deep no eye can see
Yet these simple orbs are witness
To the Holy Thing that drifts on waves
Of silence, and pulses my heart
To beat in time
with the stars.

## Up From the Depths

Humility hangs upon this neck, unseen iron weight resting there from sudden understanding
Shame flushed cheeks accepting new intimacy so natural two breaths are as one
He reclines upon the couch in mortarboard and tassel
black gown falling away from naked thigh
My hand resting quietly against the flesh suddenly familiar as my own heart beat
How is it he reclines so calmly by my side noble profile caught in the sun's bright rays
Natural place for this golden haired scholar so long held beneath the doorless cellar
No wonder he raged and painted himself white Murderous Knight of the shackled depths
How is it I did not know he belonged to me and longed only to lie serenely by my side.

## Norma Churchill <br> 2523 Steiner Street <br> San Francisco, CA 94115

maybe while you were mulling it over while doing something else, a line or phrase suddenly flashed across your consiousness and you knew exactly what the poet was trying to tell you. Creative ambiguity is what makes a poem rich with meaning and worthy of many re-readings.

Keats called the state of mind that can live with ambiguity "negative capability"; that is, poet and reader must slip into a state of awareness in which they are "capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts; without any irritable reaching after facts and reason." When you become capable of "negative capability," you feel at home with doubt and uncertainty. You make friends with ambiguity and mystery. You are ready for the sudden insights and perceptions that dreams can flash across the mind.

Keats' prescription for intuitive, poetic understanding is indeed threatening to those who want certainty, facts, and reason. Those who hunker for certainty will have difficulty understanding dreams that reflect the fluid, malleable nature of reality. To believe in the "gray" nature of reality and to discover in it the various directions our lives might turn is the starting point for working with ambiguous dream images that don't reveal their meanings immediately.

Of course, crystal clear dreams are more satisfying to work with because they fit into the established categories that explain what our life is all about. But the fixed categories usually don't lead anywhere. They keep us where we are. And dreams are always leading us in new directions simply because they are agents of change and growth. We should not let ambiguity or doubt become the hidden monster in our dreams, the one we are afraid to deal with, to confront and make our ally.

A rich dream life is meant to counter balance the rigid dichotomies that structure our waking lives. In dreams we can see how our feelings, our relationships, our work, our homes, and acquaintances might be transformed and thus transform our own lives. In dreams we discover that many of the fixed assumptions about our waking lives are as illusory as we think our dream images are.

For example, many people confess that they often feel like two or more people, each at odds with the others. The dutiful son who would like to run away from home. The doctor who would like to be less disciplined in private life but knows she has to be ready for emergencies. The teacher who doesn't believe in the value of his subject matter. The priest who envies the sinner. None of us are completely unified in our desires, wishes, public personas, and career choices. Walt Whitman warned his readers that he might "contradict" himself but not to worry because, as he said, "I contain multitudes."

Dream images, like life itself, have gray areas that need ongoing interpretation and reflection. Trust in them. Remember, it is not just Walt Whitman who contains multitudes. It is you.

And so do we all. While there is a connecting strand that holds our multiple personas together so that we can function predictably and reliably in private and public, there are also loose threads, looking for their own means of self-expression, seeking the hooks to which they might tie themselves and become anchored.

Dreams recognize the multidimensional character of life. On unconscious levels they show that there's more to us than the public selves we wear into the world each day and the private selves we relax into when we're alone. The more we become conscious of these many faces with their unique and varied expressions, desires, and fears, the better we understand ourselves. Self-knowledge, like love in the classic song, is a many splendored thing because each individual self is many and splendored.

Don't ignore or give up on dream images that are ambiguous and confusing. Too of ten we only "work" on the images that are already clear to us because they are easy to figure out. Keep meditating on the gray images and have confidence that the dream itself (or another one) will provide the meaning. Remember that even the most obscure image
is still a product of your own genius. Maintain a willing suspension of disbelief and accept the gray images on their own terms as a reflection of some aspect of your many-layered soul waiting to come into focus.

To ignore the clouded images because they are troublesome and ambiguous is to deprive yourself of a rich reservoir of selfknowledge where your genius resides. Don't be discouraged if your dreams are filled with ambiguity. Most people's are. And the reason is simple and obvious: people are ambiguous.

Committed dreamers, however, usually find that believing and living in the midst of ambiguities is challenging and liberating. It releases us from the trap of categorical thinking. Dreams, speaking from the source of of our genius, transcend polarities, unite opposites, and reconcile what appears to be contradictory. The genius of our dreams can use categories but is not confined to them. When necessary, genius can leap beyond them.

Let's use an example from poetry rather than dreams. Think back to a poem which seemed confusing, unclear, ambiguous the first time you read it. Then on the second or third reading, or
