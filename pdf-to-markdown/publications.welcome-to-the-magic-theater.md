## Introduction

As the subtitle indicates, this volume dreams. And as a handbook, it is my hope that it will not only stir a new interest in dreams, but also serve as a useful tool or vehicle for those who decide to pursue such an interest. Taken by itself, apart from your use, much of the material may seem quite abstract and dryly intellectual. But as you begin to actively inhabit you dream-worla, learn from your dreams and life, les.

The central focus of this book is simply dreams: Those dynamic movies that unsuggestion is that we begin to listen to and respect our dreams as they are. For many this is not as simple as it may sound those voices of hard rationality that put our dreams down as meaningless nonsense and step into our unknown inner world. But if we decide it is worth the effort, perhaps we can let our dreams speak for From here the what they have to of fer ich we can go. In this book I am not promoting any one approach, but will instead present many approaches to dreams and numerous ways of working with them, that you can learn from many rather than just a few. However, this is not simpiy an overview of the field. Instead, intend to put forth the material that makes sense to me and begin to set down some criteria by which we can start to sort out the garbage and misleading idea about dreams, which are certainly plentiful. I also hope to strike some balances and make some connections between various approaches to dreams.

I expect that many people who pick up this book will be fairly new to the subthe beginning of the book by briefly explaining how anyone can begin exploring their dreams. I would also caution read- to try finding an even pace at which you Trying to rush through it all at once may be overwhelming and, of course, real growth proceeds one step at a time. In working with dreams I have found that they always seem to be pointing beyond themselves, to something just around the corner so to speak. Because of this, while the starting point and central focus of this book is dreams, I have tangents that dreams have led me on, which still relate to what I'm presenting here. will try to make these relationships clear and hope this will make the journey more interesting.

The bulk of the material in this book is an annotated bibliography of writing that relates to dreams and a directory of people who are or would like to work with dreams. In compiling this information am trying to give everyone access to th basic information and the chance to contact one another. From there it is up to you.

This book is not meant to be a fina product, but part of an ongoing process.
This is important because ideas and view points on the subject of dreams have been changing rapialy as I'm sure they will continue to in the future. This volume is also an expression of my personal perspective, which is sure to change as I do. I will try to make my criteria, orientation and values clear as I go.

As you read thru this volume, you may have some comments, criticisms, or think of material and perspectives that I have left out. If so, perhaps you could jot them down and send them to me. I would like to follow-up this project, perhaps putting together a revised edition of a reality, I need your contributions and support. This is discussed more at the end of the book; for now, on with the show...

## Some Origins

To notice is to select, to regard some bits of perception, or some features of nificant than pthers. To these we attend, conscious attention is at the same time ignore-ance (i.e., ignorance) despite the pict that it gives us a vividey clear the picture of whatever we choose to notice.

Alan watts

To begin looking at our dreams mean being confronted with our ignorance, both
as individuals and as a means us are very out of touch with our drest of and it is important that we recour dreams, as our starting point. For, to a large thi. extent, our ability to recognize and accept this ignorance is necessary for us
to move beyond it.

How can we describe and understand perhaps it would be best at what it was like our past, to look society that does not cong up in be of much value; hardly consider dreams to attention.

And so many of us learned early to forget and ignore our dreams, as did our parents and their parents. This is the effect of a basic cultural message, where an attitude is passed from one generation ing that there a given, without considerWhat was your might be an alternative, can remember experience like?

There is a general knowledge that reams play a big part in Freudian psychotherapy. From this, many have the impres sion that dreams are only useful if you are cracking up and then can only be corrapist. It is well known that Freud believed many dreams were only wish fulfilments and that every image has a sexual symbolism (also know as "the hot dog and donut" theory). The Freudian approach may have some value, but for many people it has only mystified dreams further and prevented us from developing our own

These things and more are beginning to happen. And while many misleading and unappreciative attitudes towards dreams are as popular as ever with the general public, a change is beginning to occur
I am putting this book together as a means of supporting and encouraging those many individuals as well as affecting some changes on a larger scale

## The Potential <br> Value of Dreams

The net of the sleeper catches fish.

--Greek Proverb

Again and again I find that my own inner counselor, my secret dreaming self, is amusing as well.

... We do not sleep merely to live, but
to learn to live well.

-Synesius of Cyrene

I expect that most people who are reading this book have some curiosity or interest in their dreams already. And you may have a strong sense of why your dreams are important to you. But it is such a prevalent attitude in this society that there could not possibly be any value some of what I and outhers have mention our dreams. I cannet guarave gained fro get the same results, but only list these as possibilities. What you get depends on the effort you make.

1.) I have always found dreams to be an venture frcinating and enchanting adcuriosity, which is a joy to follow. Every night I am thrown into a new fantasy world full of surprises.

2.) Sleep becomes a more positive experience. I used to see sleep as a waste of time and tried to get by on as little as possible. Now I really look forward to it and give myse
and dreaming.

3.) Dreams challenge us to know ourselves better. Dreams are a biological part of everyone, even though we may feel very cut them and integrate them into our lives, we understand ourselves better. Often it
seems, dreams are pointing to something we have overlooked or giving us a new perspective on our situation.

4.) As we begin to explore our dreams we ust begin learning to think in uage of images and get in touch with ou dreams do make sense, but they don't bother speaking in our usual language or mode of logic.

5.) Dreams can be a method of tapping into our creativity. Every night we spontaneously create vivid imagery, complex with this energy greatly enriches our lives.

6.) In dreams we can discover our "personal myth," the story we tell by living the threads of meaning and continuity underlying our daily lives. We may discover in our dreams a part of our lise. Being in touch with our dreams helps us to remain centered and focused thru our ups and downs.

7.) Our dreams can point out conflicts in our lives, aid us in deciding what changes to make and provide a powerful moving force for following through on those decisions. I feel that a dream is not completely understoot 8.) Sharing our dreams with others is
sharing ourselves and enables us to know sharing ourselves and enables us to know work on and understand their dreams is an exercise in listening, caring for and supporting another person. Often we can see messages in another person's dreams that apply to our own situation.

9.) Dreams give us valuable information about our feelings and relationships with other people. Often dreams point out redreams with friends deepens and strengthens those relationships, as we 11 as pointing out struggles we have in common.

10.) Our dreams can help us see how various parts of our lives are interwoven. We may realize that feelings about our work are affecting a relationship, which in turn affects our health. By seeing these connections our lives don't feel fragmented and begin to make a ne kind of sense

11.) Dreams can give us a new perspective on the world around us and how it affects us. With this information we can decide what things we want to support and what things we want to try and change. Dreams offer a unique bridge between inner and outer worlds

12.) Dreams can offer us visions of future possibilities for personal and spiritual growth, meaningful work, relationships, social change or artistic creations. Keeping these visions in mind can greatly strengthen our chances of 13.) Dreams provide plenty of uncharted territory to explore. As I become fami1iar with dreams I develop strong contact with the great, wild mysteries of life. I am continually reminded of how much till have to learn and grow

These are some of the benefits that I think of. I do not suggest that dreams can provide a quick road to enlightenment or emotional fulfillment. Neither will they help you get rich, although they may prove helpful in re-evaluating such goals I don't feel that dreams are a simple, easy path for everyone. In fact, many of the potential benefits I have just listed require patient, persevering effort, persense, courage, and an changes.

But even as you begin to treat your dreams with care and respect, they will return the compliment. This may only happen in small and subtle ways at first. Yet over time these small changes add up and you may find your whole life turning, as I have, until it is an altogether new story. I can honestly say that my life a different place whe wise and healing mirror it through the wise and for me, but what about you? What might you get from your dreams?

Almost two years before I had dropped out of college and helped start an alte native high school. I was now on the
staff of the school, trying to learn ho to learn and to share that process with a community of people trying to do the same. It was an intense experience and I went through many changes.

I met a woman who had done some work with dreams and she offered to lead a group in the school that fall. I was very ed her mind. I didn't want to stop there so I decided to start the group myself. so I decided to start the group myself. share our dreams and see where that led us.

I made it clear from the start that although I had some knowledge, I was no here and I was simply trying to facilitate the process. I continually asked the group members to say what they wanted to do or speak up when something didn't sit right with them. Since we were all fairly new to this, everyone could have an influence on our directions.

It went very slowly at first. Sharing dreams was new to us and it felt awkward and uncomfortable. Some dreams were em barrassing, so we decided that no one trusting the group with it. Many had very trusting the group with it. Many had very "interpret" a dream. Some preferred to tell their dream without the group commenting on it. But the big struggle was forcing interpretations on it; to work on understanding it without diminishing its dynamic, living quality.

While some enjoyed reading Jung as I had, others felt uncomfortable with his thing on them too heavily. Mostly we learned thru the simple process of exper iencing the dreams. It was a major step to feel comfortable saying, "I have no idea what this dream means, but lets look into it; lets spend some time with it and see what comes of it." Still, the results varied greatly. There were ups and downs, people came and went from the group. Often it felt as though we were just wandering around in the dark. But slowly w were feeling more comfortable with our
dreams and learning from them more and dreams

The group had only been meeting for five months when I was forced to leave it because of a crisis in my own life. I sensed this had been coming for some time shoplifting. This had been a part of my life since grade school and I had already been arrested twice since turning 18 had spent a month in jail the last time and decided then that I really wanted to stop. But it was too easy to slip back
into the farmiliar patterns. Being busted this time was both a death blow and a this time was b.
welcome relief.

Throughout that fall I had dreams of shoplifting and was very bothered by them. I recall thinking, "look dreams, I know this is a problem, but why keep reminding me about it?" Since I did not really understand the nature and extent of the problem or how to change it, my dre
kept bringing it to my attention.

The next several months were a time of intense struggle and soul-searching for me. Legally, the solution to my problem seemed clear. I'd be sentenced to more time in jail and eventually, out of havior. But for me it was not so simple. I'd been in jail before and I dreaded the thought of going back. But worse, I wa afraid I could sit in jail for years and till begin stealing aqain after getting out.

I got a lawyer who was able to put off the trial while I began seeing a psychiatrist. When my court date came I plead not quilty due to insanity. The court jail again. I was very isolated during this time, which made my dreams during more important to me.
When I first met my psychiatrist I
it clear to him that I understand myself and wanted to me. But. it was very important the help work together and that he should not try to manipulate me or analyze me in ways that I did not feel comfortable with This worked fine as long as I really worked at it. However, he did not know how to work with dreams and could only isten and support what I was learning in this area. One day during my time in jail I saw him and related a dream that had been very helpful to me. His only
reply was, "Have you ever heard of Jesus reply was, "Have you ever heard of Jesus
Christ?" As it became clear that he felt I should give up dreams, meditation, and other practices that were genuinely helpful to me, and seek salvation in Jesus, our relationship deteriorated rapidly and was soon terminated.

While most of my energies were directduring this time, I was also and growth role society played in my situation what what ways was I being baiteduation. In erial society to want things I this matneed? What real needs were being deni e? Why was it that so many people I talked to said they would gladly shop lift, if only they weren't afraid of bein

As I examined these questions I rea ized that my stealing was a response to a crazy, poisonous situation. It was a des-
perate response that was a perate response that was ruining my life and also ineffectual in changing the sit uation. So, after getting out of jail I begin to look for ways I could re-direct change things. This led me to working with libraries and bookselling, but with a radically different perspective. Now I was on the other side of the fence, sow I ing for ways to provide people with access so they would not want to steal from me. I am still, years later, trying to follow through on the lessons I learned during
that time.

Siscoveral months after I got out of jail, Dream Power. I was very excited to fin that someone else was working al to find lar lines as I was and learned a great deal from her. Since then I have starte numerous dream groups involving people from a wide variety of situations. A1though there is still an initial period of awkwardness that a group goes through as has become more our work in these groups dreams become faniliare effective as the groups have built a territory. These ity support for individual sense of commungle that has become very important to me.

Perhaps the most intense experience I've had with my dreams occured about a with the image of my brother had a dream to be pointing to guilt I felt about my relations with women and my male conditioning to be aggressive. I went through two years of diaries and collected over 100 dreams that contained my brother or related to these issues.

As I worked on these, both by myself and in the group, many connections became spoke their piece, to whame to life and cried in reply whom I screamed and experience and I had to very intense effort to follow through o determined to avoid being overwhelmed by more learned material. One thing I did to follow through this experience was follow consciousness-raising (C-R) group. This was a way for men to get together and look at the effects of sexism in our daily
lives, to see how we oppress lives, to see how we oppress women, how to begin struggling together to hurt us and these things. This proved to change these things. This proved to be a very
good place to continue working through some of the things my dreams pointed to I now consider $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{R}$ to be an important part of all group work I do.

In addition to sharing dreams with others roups, I have talked with many friend nd strangers about dreams. I am cony people are with their drearms. It's a new idea to many people that they might writ their dreams down or share them with a friend and learn from this process. time and again I've seen a few sims lead to suggestions about explons life. So I decidbig changes in a pok together to present ed to put this book together people.

I've been working on this project for over two years now and it has grown and changed continually. In the process I have learned quite a lot. With a great deal of searching I have found some excel lent writing on dreams that compliment and deepens the knowledge that acquired in my work with groups.
best part of this project has been corresponding with others who are working with dreams. It is good to know that my work is not an isolated event. support art in the expressed has played a

Remembering And Recording S Your Dreams

proper respect for dreams will be a fund amental prerequisite for learning how to remember them. remember them. $\quad-$ Henry Reed

It has recently been proven scientif ically that everyone dreams every night bering their dreams. Some will even swear that they never dream. However, it's not that they don't dream, but that they don't remember. Why is this so difficult? Is it possible for us to learn to remember our dreams?

Part of the difficulty comes from the nature of dreams, but the attitudes that dreams are the big factor here. Our dreams are sensitive and our memory of them is fragile. But our society has not considered them important or valuable. Many of us have learned to view our drearns with indifference, fear, impatience, dis trust and ignorance. We have learned to
discount and forget our dreams and it is mpor some tim

ing something esoteric, weird or even crazy, And yet dric, weird or even peoples in all times. As we become familiar with the world of dreams, we can see that they use the same mode of expression, the same kind of "logic", the dynamic, emotion-packed language of images.
Our dreams are a natural part of all of us, an integral portion of the biology quite isolate them and grasp them as objects "out there." When we are looking at our dreams, we are gazing into a kind of inner mirror. Since dreams are a part of us, our memory of them can be improved by a change in attitude

How can you develop an attitude that is inviting to your dreams? You can begin with a simple curiosity, a desire to know yourself better. You can identify and reevaluate feelings and beliefs you have developed about dreams in the past. You can space for them in your daily by making deciding you will try to respect and by they send you way. As you come to show an interest in and respect for your dreams. they will return the compliment.

While attitude is the most important factor in increasing your recall of dreams
there are specific things you can do to complement this change in attitude. Since different things work for different peop try a range of things to see what wo kon't
best for you. Don't give up if you don't get immediate results. Some peopld habits and develop a good memory for dreams.

The time you spend sleeping and dreaming is valuable time. Make sure you recognize this and give yourseltivities an concerns of the day to rest and regenerate. Dreaming appears to play an important part in the process of regeneration.

Scientific research has uncovered useful knowledge in this area. It was observed in dream laboritories that several times during a nights sleep, people enter a light stage of sleep and their eyes move rapidly under the lids. This shows that the person is dreaming. If they are awaken immediately after these rapid eye movements (REMs) they wor to remember a dream. 1 heep and then are fall into a deeper sleep andten. This awaken, they may hed that everyone spends research also 25 percent of their sleeping time dreaming.

Just before you fall asleep in the evening, remember that you will dream tonight. Remind yourself that of a dream and catch it in your memory. Re-affirm your intentions to remember and record your dreams when you awake by placing a pen paper and dim light by your bed.

Even if you have never remembered a dream before, it's important to be ready for them. Since memory for dreams is so fragile, it's good to have some way to record them in permanent form. Furthermore, when you have been keeping a diary of your dreams for some time, you wly what able to look back and review exactyeries happened in a dream or ientify that can or development in your dreans the find only be recognized be easier than writing dream down, but it may prove harder to the dreams later. Whatever works for you...

The point of waking is a crucial time for catching a dream. If you are jolted awake abruptly by an alarm and have a list of the days activities in mind which you have to jump right into, you won't have much chance of remembering a dream. I will make a big difference if you can arrange a little time in the morning to urn your attention inward and quietly reflect for a while.

As you awake, gently focus your atter1tion on whatever is in your mind. It may be just an image, a feeling, a thought, or thing there, no matter how small or insignificant it seems, focus on that, get into it and follow it. Often a small fragment or vague feeling can unfold into a longer dream-memory if we stay with it. If we discount it and decide it's not worth our attention, we can easily loose the only clue we have.

once you have gone over what you remember in your mind, write it down immediately. Don't wait while you do something your memory can fade. I always write the dream down in first person present tense as though it were happening now--this keeps me much more in touch with it. Record the date and exactly what you remember of the dream--no more, no less.
You may wish to save some space between dreams to note any feelings or associa tions that come you. Record these separately; the dream down as it happened.

There are a wide range of things you can do with a dream diary. You may wish to leave room for notes about your waking life or to do further work on the dreams. How thoroughly or briefly you describe the dream (drawings?) may vary depending on how important it is to you. If you are remembering more dreams than yout we cord you can let some go by, but do what you can. it to get it written down rasses it may prove valuable later. consider my dream diary private until I feel ready to share a dream with others. This makes it more comfortable to record all of my dreams.

Gradually, as you work on it over a period of time, you can learn to be more sensitive when you awake. Tere may still be times when your and seems beflecting morning. minute. Henry Reed suggests laying in different positions in which you have been sleeping to see if that brings any memerorry, there will be more chances on fol lowing nights. You cannot force yourself to remember a dream and trying too hard may chase them away. But if you are patient and keep following this basic steps; your night will come.

If you continue to have trouble, Ann Faraday has suggested that you might try having a conversation with your dreams. Ask them why they don't come to you anc listen for their reply. Jack Johnston suggests that. you look at the last dream

Again, attitude is the important thing and as you decide you really want to re member your dreams, you will probably start to do so. With each dream you remember and record, your dream-world will become a little clearer and more familiar. Some dreams will make sense and seem val uable immediately, but others may seem

## Sharing and Working On Dreams

A dream not understood is like a letter. not opened.

-The Talmud

Remember, that with your dreams and the dreams of others, the object is not to but to learn to live there.

- Tolbert McCarroll

Dreaming is a private act. There are ways that we can observe that a person is dreaming, but here even science has its observe what another person is dreaming. observe what another person is dreaming. may enjoy having your own private dreamworld. You might also want to share some perspectives on the dreain.

Whether or not you share any particuar dream is always your decision. Since people in our society don't share dreams very often, i.t may initially seem awkward or strange to try doing so. I have bee sharing dreams with others for several years now and feel I have benefited great-
iy from it. I have al.so found that. there is an art to telling, listening to and working on dreams which can marience. easier and more valuable experience.

First, let me share some thoughts about how dreams seem to work. (I cannot prove this theory, but it feels right and has proven usefu1 to me.) In the proce of growing up we learn co consc lous focus our attention so that we are better able to deal with and manipulate the wo around us. This is a valuable ar but it is also a dangerous one. Kor focusing on one thing means ignoring of us others. And as a consequer picture, as well 1 as our real feel.ings and the real-
ities of our inner world. Our lives become a series of parts that we can focus on one at a time--our work, relationships, spiritual growth, sexuality, artistic expression, taking out the garbage, etc.mented and without a center.

At night, when we sleep and can forget about dealing with the world, our dreams point to parts of our life situation that we have overlooked and revea the way various aspects of our lives are inter-woven. We could say that dreams are drawing attention to our conscious awareness. Yet, when we first look at awareness. Yet, wy still be too close to our dreams, we may sto see them cleatly. We need some distance, need to view them from another perspective. This is the biggest advantage to sharing a dream with others; other people can offer us varied perspectives on our dream and
relate to our life situation.

Many people have a very negative image of what it means to interpret a dream. Perhaps you visualize a patient lying on a couch while the therapist tells them what their dream means. You may anticipate an abstract, intellectual process of pul.1.ing the dream apart and tacking a meaning on each image. I wou1d like to suggest that there is an alternative to this approach and rather than "analyzing or "interpreting" a dream, we can begin to exp
dream.

What I'm proposing is a cooperative rocess wherein we trust the dreamer and their dreams; where a dream is shared and other perspectives are offered, but always checked out with the dreamer to make sure they make sense for their life situation. I bellieve that working on a dream must be a process where life is respected, support apart, analyzed and shrunk down to fit into some neat theory. Therefore, rather than start out with a theory, I'd like to directly experiencing our dreams from a variety of perspectives. When we success fully work on a dream, we can enter it and view our lives from this new vantage point.

Most of the dream-work I have done has been with groups of 4 to 15 people who got together specifically to share and work on dreams. The groups were formed by friends and friends of friends, as well as people who responded to notices posted around town or listed in a learning exchange. met on a weekly basis, moving between usually lasts $3-5$ hours long. (These forms can be varied to fit your situation or purposes.)

For the first sessions of a group we spend alot of time discussing dreams in general and the experiences people have
had with dreams in the past. This is a good time for the group to explore any questions we have and begin looking at what we would like to do together as a group. There may be special areas that group members would like to explore or material. the group would like to read together. We found it very helpful to start ali sesslo sout where they have say a few words about where they have they have a specific dream they would like to work on.

When someone feels ready to share a specific dream, we begin the work. prefer working with an entire dream,
rather than just a portion of one. relieve that an image can onl.y be under stood in the context of the dream, which in turn must be seen in the context of the dreamer's life. But, if al1 a person can remember is a fragment, single image or vag
with.

To begin, the entire dream is to $1 \mathrm{~d}$ exactly as it happened, as though it were happening now. It is best if the dream
has been reviewed by the dreamer, so it can be told we11, rather than just read. If some background material is essential, this can be related first, but no inter pretations or associations should be ask that the dream always be told in the first person present tense, which means that a statement would begin "I am... rather than "There was..." This may feel awkward at first, but it is a very import ant habit to deve1op. By relating the dream as though it were happening to the
dreamer right now, we stay in much closer dreamer right now, we stay in much closer
contact with the energy and feeling it contact with the energy and feeling it
embodies as well as making it much more interesting for others to listen to. We emotional as they want to in relating their dream for the same reasons.

Meanwhile, other group members sit back, open up and try to really listen; mream every effort to hear and feel the volved in a dream as an active listener, noticing how the dream looks and feels to us; what strikes us as odd, scary, curious
or funny. When the dreamer has finished relating. When the dreamer has fant relating the dream, others may want por-
tions of it clarified or repeated. (Note if the dreamer only wants to share the dream and what they got from it, it is fine to stop here and go on to someone e1se. Usual1y they want to exp1ore
and work on it further.)

After the dream is told, we begin the process of amplification, which means the background that it seems to refer to The dreamer often takes the lead by pointing out an area they would 1ike to explore or relating the thoughts and feelings they have already had about the dream. The basic question we are asking here is "how could this dream relate to the dreamer's life?" Any information that might possibly relate to the dream may be useful in clarifying the background against which ise dream will make sense. Amplification s slight ly different from free associadream.

Gradually, we begin to explore the dream. Everyone is encouraged to get involved, to get into the dream and spend some time there. We focus on specific mages, feelings, conflicts, background itions; the story line or various trans passing it from one person to another to et many different perspectives. Everyone can offer up whatever feelings or ideas come to them, even if it is a vague hunch. A11 possibilities are then checked out ith the dreamer to see if they fit their life situation.

It is crucial that the dreamer play an active role in this process. They are th possibilities suggested really fit their situation. Every suggestion must be check. ed out and related to specific circumstances --so the dreamer replies, "yes, that fits my situation and here's how... or, "no, I don't fee1 that applies to
life." Often a suggestion that doesn't apply will remind the dreamer of something e1se that does.

It is important that members of the group build trust between each other so we ably. However, we don't expect people will automatically trust one another and never force it when the trust isn't there oesn't feel ready to explore, we respect those feelings and move on to something 1se. I feel that real deep trust grow best as peop1e get to know one another space for this by having occasional pot uck dinners before the workshops and a short break midway through. People often get together outside the group as well.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_11_8947d0c1c1ac2253f22ag-11.jpg?height=290&width=598&top_left_y=453&top_left_x=1058)

We must learn to trust and respect our dreams. The dream uses the best means waking-world laws of logic and realism. breams can use metaphor, parable, puns and intense drama to get their point across At other times they are so straight-forward and literal that it is startling. As we begin exploring dreams, we must learn to think in their language, the language of images. This usually takes some time. We may spend thirty minutes to an hour more with a dream before things star Be patient. Although it takes time, dream can contain amazing amounts of mation and unlock a great deal of energy and emotion.

A dream can reveal insights on several different levels. Ann Faraday has suggest ed a progression of levels on which we proved very useful in our groups. We progin by asking if the dream refers egin bective, external world around us. to the may be depicted in a very literal and obvious form, or in a more symbolic way. These dreams can offer us warnings or reminders of things we have noticed on some level, but have not registered consciously, have discounted or ignored. The message may be relatively small, perhaps a reminder that your clothes need mending, or it can refer to something on a larger of nature by modern technology. destruction

Next we look for the expression of our subjective feelings about our lives. This leve1 concerns our interactions with the world. Others may or may not share our feelings, but the important thing is recognize that they are real for us. These first levels can be exp1ored fairly
well with the process just described. well with the process just described. (
will have more to say about these levels will have more to say about these levels
in the following essay on consciousnessraising.)

Finally, we can see if the dream il1minates our private inner world; the con-
flicts, struggles, or current state of flicts, struggles, or current state of
affairs within the dreamer. of course affairs within the dreamer. Of course,
these various levels don't have clear these various levels don t have clear sages on several levels. But a basic progression from outer to inner meaning has proven very useful.

Since we are the creators of our dreams, we do know what they are about,
although it may be difficult getting in although it may be difficult getting in touch with that deep knowledge. One very
powerfu1 way of working with dreams is called psychodrama or gestalting a dream. This method is usually saved for later in flicts within the dreamer, although concan never be certain what will come up. It works best when there are strong emotions or a clear conflict in the dream. For many people it takes several attempts before they feel comfortable with this process; we never push someone who doesn't feel ready for it.

We begin by choosing a dream image, whether it is a building, a person, an that image. As they get into what that image feels like, they begin to act it out, expressing whatever comes to mind nd really hamming it up. The dreamer ets the image use their voice to say whatever it has to say. Often a dialogue the dreamer with another image. Then the dreamer becomes the other image to reply and so on as the dialogue progresses.
It has been amazing to see a group think and think about an image without results, yet when the dreamer becomes that image
and lets it speak eously comes forth, the meaning spontancan be very helpful in guiding this process. See Blbliography for a more approach.)

As we work on dreams and begin to learn from them, it is important that we follow through what we learn by making corresponding changes in our lives. Knowledge that is not acted on is useless and may be a heavy, even overwhelming burden. I agree with Ann Faraday again when she says that a dream is not fully understood
until it moves us to change our 1 ife in unti1 it moves us to change our life in
some way. After working on a dream it is some way. After working on a dream it is
valuable for the dreamer to sum up what was learned and how they intend to act on this message. The person may also wish to discuss how this is followed up in future discuss ho

Whatever feels is of prime always ask the dreamer ane results, we whether they fee 1 finish the group on to another dream. It is important that we learn to feel comfortable important that dreams a mystery. There will be other dreams and there will always be some mystery remaining.

After a group has been together for several months, we gain a familiarity wit our dream-worlds and can get much more out ience to work on a dream successfully The dreamer will often physically ience a release of new energy. A fully integrated dream can provide a powerful moving force that guides that person for months or years. For others it is a more subtle feeling of being more centered, as they gradually recognize an ongoing direction and meaning in their life. By
sharing dreams together, group members have gotten to know each other quite deeply in a short period of time. The friendship and support we have been able to offer one another is quite important. This has been a description of what sn't exactly what you want or can arrange, fee1 free to try other variations. You may want to try a one-shot workshop to see if there is interest in an ongoing group. perhaps you can only get together with one or two other people. You could even try working on your dreams by yourse1f, a1though this is much more difficult. Ornal descript1ons of the Bib1iography.) Experiment, try out a variety of things to find out what is right for you. Only by undertaking the journey will you discover where it will lead you.

It for not having all too often forgotten that the ancient symbol for the prenascense of the world is a fool, and that foolishness. being a divine state, is not a condition to be either proud or ashamed of. Unfortunately we find systems of education today which have departed so far from the proud of what we know and ashamed of ignorance. This is doubly corrupt. It is corrupt not only because pride is in itself a mortal sin, but also because to teach pride in knowledge is to put an effective barrier against any advance upon what is already known, since it makes one ashamed to look beyond

## The Consciousness-Raising Aspect

wholeness means being conscious of the different components of one's existance: means keeping social and historical awareness present along with personal and psychological need and insight; means attempting to bind together the external, physical and spiritual, and external, physical and spious and unconscious, cultural and conscious and unconscious, cultural and personal, come's life no matter what pain or conflict is involved. We must come to some uneasy balance between personal growth and social commitment, a balance that is needs and social demands.

Herbert Kohe mononononononononoment

Our dreams are a true, living mirror; a magic looking glass whose reflection can dreams cannot lie, although they can be misunderstood. In order to fully experience the truth our dreams express it is crucial that we suspend our preconceptions and openly step into the dream-space. From there we look back to see our lif and our world from the perspective of the dream. The better we get at doing this, the closer we will he dream on its own terms.

When we first approach our dreams it will seem that they are anything but a reflection of our lives. As in Alice's looking-g1ass world, everything seems distorted, backwards and illogica1--so foreign, in fact, that it may seem the exact opposite from our usual view of the tent of the dreaps this is the very inof our situation. If we do not immediat ely reject this viewpoint as crazy, meaning.less nonsense and can spend some time within the perspective of the dream, we may suddenly be struck by a sense of recognition! As we examine this sense of familiarity, our certainty will grow, until we can say, "Of course, that's a perfect picture of my situati.on. Why hadn't I looked at it that way before?"
This point of recognition is the most important part of effective dreamwork, although it may take some time to arrive at, or only occur in small ways at first. As you spend time exp1oring dreams, you can learn to enter the dream's perspective more easily and clearly recognize how the dream reflects your life. It is important that we learn to recognize and a dream might reflect.

A dream is a personal statement, re flecting the dreamer's current life situation. Because of the highly personal nature of dreams, they have usually (in our culture) been relegated to the
realm of psychology and explored in realm of psychology and explored in
wholly personal terms, as revealing nowholny personal terms, as revealing noWhile a great deal has been learned in this context, this as fuses to recognize a large portion of our lives. We all live within a cultural con text, a social reality which affects us very deeply. Our dreams reflect the world around us as we11 as within us. We must learn to recognize this, Our lives do no need to be split up, inner from outer, personal from soci.al. In dreams we can see the totality and underlying unity of

Working with our dreams offers each person a vehicle for continual reflection, change, renewal and growth. As living
beings it seems we need to continually grow and change or we begin to stagnate,
lose our flexabi1ity, and act destructively. Health is then stop learning and we can acheive and then stop, "He [sic] not growing. As Dylan busy dying."

Dreamwork can offer us a vehicle for social change as well as personal growth. The first step is learning to recognize the world around us in the previous chapter, dreams. we begin to the external world and dream relates to the ith it. It is very our interact that we thoroughly explore this level before moving to a purely inner level of meaning. Even later in the dreanwork we

When we explore the dream in a group, everyone can suggest any of these pos bilities and check them out with is the dreamer. But again, the dreames their final authority about what of situation. A dream wil similar dreams or other gruations. Sharing these can be very he1pful in showing the dreamer they very not alone in their experience. However, too long a side-track can be a real distraction from the dream under consideration. We give the dreamer authority say whether they want to get back to their dream or hear other's experiences.

Dreamwork can be extended and strength ened with the use of Consciousness-Raising (C-R). Consciousness-Raising begins with the realities of each person s life.
we relate this to the social context we we re in, identifying what is healthy or

Dreamwork seems to be an excellent medium for $C-R$. A dream i.s never vague or abstract, but focuses clearly on the dreamer's present situation. Likewise,
good C-R does not begin with theories and good C-R does not begin with theories and assumptions, but with the concrete realseeks to recognize the connections between seeks to recognize the connections borld they live in, dreams can also provide conscious and unconscious, the individual and their community. Our dreams can lead us toward a center, toward some sort of balance or cycle between inner and outer growth. It is up to you to discover what the best balance is for you. No-one else can tell you what is best for you, although you may benefit from their feed-
back and criticism.

For us, a dream group is a cooperative process, not an encounter group. Since

A drearn can help clarify our feelings and values. We may be led to re-evaluate whether our work is fulfilling or stifling, whether we are really learning anything in school or how much we trust the people around us. We must listen closely for the "teaching story" aspect of the dream and

Group dreamwork offers an opportunity for growth to everyone, even when someone necessarily means more than personal solutions to personal problems. In the course of exploring dreams, it is inevitable that we will recognize some destructive aspects of our society that one tive aspects of our society that one

Learning to recognize a need, desire, ability or method for affecting change in the world around us is a gradual process.
The need for a change may initially come to our attention when we are clearly being held back or oppressed by the society Some nightmares may be pointing to extreme it desperate attempt to bring the situation

Dreams can do more than reflect oppressive situations and show us that changes are needed, they can also help u find ways of struggling through thos changes and give us visions of future

These ideas about the C-R aspect of dreamwork are not abstract theory. They come from direct experience, both for me and for others who have used dreams in this way (see Bibliography \& Directory), But if you still have doubts, don't take my word for it--look to your own dreams and see what you find.

I have compiled this bibliography to show the wide variety of approaches to dreams that others have written about so that you can find the materials to
explore any area that interests you. In this listing I am not trying to rritten on list everything that has been writect of the the subject that I have found useful or impormaterial then with a short review or excerpt I try to show why the book is important. Frankly, of everything written on dreams, I find much of it to be downright crap or useless dribble.

## A. Good Starting Points

Dream Power, by Ann Faraday, Berkley Meda1lion, \$1.95, $1973,320 \mathrm{pp}$

This book is a major breakthrough in the exploration of dreams and I recommend it as an excellent starting point. She dreams, her work in dream laboratories and dreams, her work in dream laboratories work. She also underwent three years of work. She also underwent three years of
Freudian analysis and describes in detail
its destructive aspects as she experienced itsem. This she calls "violence by interpretation", created by the analysts belief that the dream is trying to hide things from the dreamer and the dreamer's feeling about the dream is probably wrong. How-
ever, she trusted her dreams and was able ever, she trusted her dreams
to see thru this in the end.

The work of leading students of dreams is then discussed and inter-related to form a broad, comprehensive approach.
Freud, Hall, Perls and Jung are all briet iy covered. But Ann Faraday emerges as captive of none of these theories. "The day of the guru is over... we've 2.11 got the power inside of us.". This expresses
a major effort to demystify dreams, as she shows how they noed not be the exclusive domain of therapists. Her dedi cation reads, ..to my hypnotists for

All through the book specific examples are given from the authors' dreams and life, giving us the priceless example of Seems this book was a natural next step, an effort to give evcryone access to their own dream power.

Excerpts:

There are many books in which psychotherapists have described their patients dreams and case historles, but most have remal a peuent about or awn or else hope that my attempts at self-disciosure will encourage others to share theirsure experiences of drean power in asirilar spirit of openness and honesty.

..the cardinal rule in all cases being never to impose a meaning on a dream bu
to allow it to speak for itself.

Looking back, it is clear that my dream had predicted the course of the analysis with astonishing accuracy. My analyst had him to do by treat ing my career as a symphim to in spite of the fact that I had gone to him not because I was ill, but for training. He had also used his Freudian theory like a hammer, trying to refurnish my life with his own (and Freud's) values about what a "real woman" should be, although this did violence to my whole nature.

Psychotherapists and analysts in particular should beware of their professional habit of treating all their patients'
munications, including dreams, as mere "projections" of the personality, contain when, we have explored a dream thoroughly for signs of objective truth and checked on it, should we take it as a mirror reflecting our subjective attitudes toward
life.

This is Ann Faraday's second book and in many ways it is much better than her first. Since the former book traces her background and explains others theories of areams, in this volume she launches right ten, and again she illustrates her ideas with many vivid, powerful dreams (some of famous personalities). It's a joy to read as her energy and enthusiasm shine through. She goes quite deeply into perls model of topdog and underdog conflicts. "He called the internal authority voices the "topdogs" of the mind, trying continually yet fruitlessly to impose their will on the rest of the personality, which then behaves like an "underdog" wanting to
topdog's approval and at the same time trying to get its own way." She sees this conflict emerging in areams quite frequent $1 y$ and offers methods of working it through. Again, all the basic tools are here for the beginner, together with many laus
for further dreamwork. She looks at puns in dreams, nightmares, flying dreams, lucid and high dreams. Many surprises here and lots of good sense.

There are many ways to play the dream game and this book is sure to get you off to a good start.

Excerpts :

For we, and only we, are the painters of our dream pictures, and learning to underour dreams is a matter of learning to understand our heart's language. psychotherapist or dream guru may come tations, but unless they resonate with your own bones and move you to change your life in some constructive way, then they remain useless speculations on his [sic] part, which logically is the same as say-
ing they are just plain wrong.

In our culture we not only train our children to think with their heads, but we actively discourage them from listening to their hearts..

By this, I am not implying that the heart is necessarily always correct. As a general rule, however, I have found that when the head and heart agree on any issue, rect, whereas if they disagree you had better start asking questions.

Learning to spot dream puns is not only essential in understanding how the dreamng mind works, it also puts you in touch and humor you probably never realized you possessed.

I am sometimes asked whether it could be dangerous to stimulate the recall of dangerous as living--no more no less as but it has also been my experience fro working with thousands of people all over the world that such fears are just another example of catastrophic expectations, with no foundations in fact. As the main culprits in spreading such fears are psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, I sometimes wonder if their real concern is with pos sible loss of business or professional prestige.

The distinction between selfishness and unselfishness is a top-dog invention that does not apply at the deepest level of the personality, where concern for others flows naturally from healthy self-love.

What is really happening is that dancing together we are ourselves the higher intelligence with a power of consciousness that none of us individually can withstand. When we stop dancing, we are left with on1y a vague nosalgia for a being greater than oursel.ves

Teaching people to work on dreams... may have value for preventive psychiatry, in that the therapeutic work becomes autonoand people have learned ways of taking care of their own psychological needs.

My preference is for exploring the dream experientially first and then asking, "What does it mean?" and "What can I do

B. Jungian Approach

CarI Jung begin as a student of Freud, but broke away from him partly because of disagreements with Freud's methods of deal his dogmatic methods of interpretation and his notion that dream were disguising something about the dreamer. Instead, Jung felt that the dream was a pertect expres ion and that we should learn to listen more carefully.

Jung stressed that by working with our dreams we could create a better balance, so that conscious and unconscious are workto have a natural healing function and point the individual towards positive growth, which Jung calls the process of individuation. He also relates dreams to individuation. He also relates dreams archetypal imagery in our dreams, which from the collective unconscious.

while Jung has many valuable ideas, his writing is often very difficult for the average reader and his ideas seem overly complicated and mystifying at times Fortunately, many of his followers have expressed his ideas in a slightly more accessable form. While Jung stressed the importance of never forcing an interpre ation on a dream, some interpret the impression that dreams withand mythological images are less important We must be open to hearing the dream speak on all levels.

Excerpts:

.in our civilized life, we have stripped so many ideas of their emotional energy, we do not really respond to them anymore.

...I have always said to my pupils: "Learn as much as you can about symbolism; then forget it when you are analyzing a dream." Man [sic] feels himself [sic] isolated in the cosmos, because he [sic] is no longer involved in nature and has lost his [sic] emotional "unconscious identity with natural phenomena. No river contains a spirit, no tree is the life principle of a man [sic], no snake the embodiment of great demon. No voices now home of a great aemon. No voices now speak to man nor does he [sic] speak to them believin they can hear. This enormous loss is compensated for by our original nature--its instincts and peculiar thinking.

## c. Gestalt Approach

Gestalt therapy has developed a very intense and effective way of working with dreams. It involves becoming different parts of the dream and acting them out. creating a very emotional, gut-level inter action with the dream that can produce many surprises and lead to some clear resolutions of inner conflicts.

Unfortunately, this approach has been used as doqma by many, who decide that it is the only way a dream can be worked wit and view other approaches as avoiding the real issues. In my work I try to learn
various approaches and use whatever seem most appropriate for a particular situation. (See Appendix I for other criticism.)

Instead of telling the dream as if it were a story in the past, act it out in the present, so that it becomes a part of yourself, so that you are really involved. ...if you want to work on your own, I suggest you write the dream down and make Get every person, every thing, every mod Get every work on these to becovery mood, of them. Ham it up, and really transform yourself into each of the different items. Really become that thinq--whatever it is in a dream--become it. Use your magic. Turn into that ugly frog or whatever is there--the dead thing, the live thing, the demon--and stop thinking.

Next, take each one of these different items, characters, and parts, and let them have encounters between them. Write a script. By "write a script," I mean have a dialogue between the two opposing parts and you will find--especially if you get the correct fighting each other. al wet

So if you work on dreams it is better if you do it with someone else who can point out where you avoid. Understanding the dream means realizing when you are avoid ing the obvious. The only danger is that
this other person might come too quickly to the rescue and tell you what is going on in you, instead of giving yourself the chance of discovering yourself.

Male Supremacy In Freud, by phil Brown, in Radical Psychology, Ed. by Phil Brown Harper, $\$ 3.95,1973,548 \mathrm{pp}$

Excerpts:

..in the Interpretation of Dreams... there are constant references to the woman as the passive sex in her role as housewife, male-seeker, suckler of babies and physically clumsy. This is carried on into dream-symbolism: "All elongated objects, sticks, tree trunks, unbrellas, all sharp and elongated weapons, knives, daggers and pikes represent the male member. ..Small boxes, chests, cupboards, and ovens cor-
respond to the female organ; also cavities, ships, and all kinds of vessels."

The basic assumption behind all this is the penetration of the male penis into the fenale valitha is the only acceptable mode to include all forms of human expander persons in dreams are taken to represen the penis, and landscapes to represent the vagina, the logic of this being that men are active persons within an environment passive women being the background for male achievement

Black Elk Speaks, by John Neihardt, Univ. of Nebraska, $\$ 1.50,1932,288 \mathrm{pp}$.

The life story of a holy man of the oglala Sioux

Excerpts:

This, then, is not the tale of a great hunter or of a great warrior, or of a great traveler... it was the story of a mighty vision given to a man too weak to use it; of a holy tree that should have flourished in a people's heart with flowers and singing birds, and is now withered, and of a people's dream that died i bloody snow

But if the vision was true and mighty, as I know, it is true and mighty yet; for such things are of the spirit, and it is in the darkness of their eyes that men get lost.

...a man who has a vision is not able to use the power of it until after he has performed the vision on earth for the people to see. You remember that my great vision came to me when I was only nine
years old, and you have seen that I was not much good for anything until after I performed the horse dance..

You hiave noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because circles... Our teepees were round like the nests of birds, and these were always set in a circle, the nation's hoop, a nest of many nests, where the Great Spirit meant us to hatch our children. But the Wasichus have put us in these square boxes. Our power is gone and we are dying, for the power is not in us anymore.

Excerpts :

Every man can cry for a vision, or "lament" and in the old days we all--men and women-"lamented" all the time. what is received through the "lamenting" is determined in part by the character of the person who does this, for it is only those people who are very qualified who recelve the great men, and which give strength an heal th to our nation.

There are many reasons for going to a
lonely mountaintop to "lament." Some lonely mountaintop to "lament." Some young men receive a vision when they are very young and when they do not expect it might understand it better. Then we "lament" if we wish to make ourselves brave for a great ordeal such as the Sun Dance or to prepare for going on the war path. But perhaps the most important reason for "lamenting" is that it helps us to realize our oneness with all things, to know that all things are our relatives..

The P1e-Temiar Senoi are a non-literate people who live in the jungles of the Mala peninsula S Sarthropologist named Herber by a Brytishas joined in the 1930's by psychologist Kilton Stewart, who wrote extensively about their traditions with dreams. These reported traditions are proving to offer an exciting new way to work with dreams, although they also seem to be highly controversial and disputed

Unfortunate1y, there are also numerous people who seem to be greatly misinterpreting and distorting those practices for their own benefit, I feel that the work and writings of Clara Stewart Flagg, Joseph Hart all represent dangerous distortions of Stewart's writings I find no evidence that the Ple-Temiar Senol advocated anything close to the control and manipulation of dreams that these people practice. My criticism of these approaches is explatned more thorough1y in the Appendix on pages $105-109$.

 Noone with Dennis Holman,(Hardcover) 1972, $212 \mathrm{pp}$.

Herbert (Pat) Noone was eventually killed by a Senoi during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia.; This is the stor of his younger brother's search to find out what happened. In it he discusses the Senoi's use of dreams breifly and points style and non-violent values. We also get a picture of how these people are caught in the clash between the communists and the "free world," as Noone puts it. I am left wondering how much of this culture has been altered by its contact with the modern world.

Excerpts:

To the Temiar the dream is a spiritual experience, in a sense as real and import ant as physical experience in his [sic]. waking hours. ..few important decisions are made by a group without one of its members having had a dream that points to a certain course of action.

Most Temiar inspiration comes from their dreams. I have met men who dreamed up mechanical inventions such as fish traps,
complicated puzzles, decorative patterns, medicinal remedies. Their poetry, their songs, their music

Hoping to first observe this phenomenon and to then investigate its implication and potential userulness, I have been working to reconstruct a ritual of

This book is perhaps the clearest, strongest description of how we can recognize and struggle with the multi-facet-
ed networks of unfreedom that ed networks of unfreedom that pervade our mented by personal experience; perhaps the only way of demonstrating how the personal
is political. Recommended.
Excerpts

Exploitation. Oppression. Domination. Expectation. Objectification. These are crude and ending with the most suble. There are different kinds of unfree. there are different degrees of unfreedom Unfreedom can involve violent coercion unseen self-restriction. Unfreedom func tions on an individual as well as social evel. Unfreedom involves a subtle network of all of the above.

It's necessary to find out what the assumptions of our particular mentality are, so that we can get rid of them when trying to raise our consciousness.

picture consciousness being high or low. Our mentality defines how we see the world. Our consciousness defines what we can do with what we see.

...the political is personal--because all the consciousness in the world, if not bring about personal change, to enough to the limitations (and the debilitating effects) of consciousness, consciousness needs to be shared and validated by others; consciousness needs to relate to robust activity; consciousness needs to (be based in but) transcend individual reality by maintaining a vital two-way connection with world social reality.

I saw a woman sleeping. In her sleep she dreamt life stood before her, and held in each hand a gift-in the one Love, in the "cher Freedom. And she said to the woman, And the wi

"Freedom!" taited long: and she said,

And Life said, "Thou hast well chosen. If thou hadst said, "Love," I would have given thee that thou didst ask for; and I thee no more. Now, the dau will come when I shall return. In that day I shall bear both gibts in one hand.

I heard the woman laugh in her sleep. -olive schreiner

I Drean In Female: The Metaphors of Evolution, by Barbara Starrett, in the book: The Lesbian Reader, Ed. by Covin $\&$ Galana, $\$ 4.50$ from the Amazon Press,
395 60th St., Oakland, Calif. 94618 . Excerpts:

Patterns are non-verbal, non-pictorial, formless dynamics, deep, deep within our minds. Language, symbols, myths, culture art, dreams, social structures, thought modes, etc., are all expressions of patterns. Patterns inform both the mind and the body. Patterns are natural and innate or they are unnatural and imposed/condi tioned. Patterns vary from individual individual. They may vary a great deal from group to group. There are patterns which have informed society and culture for centuries. I will call them mare pat terns. There are new pate not the same.

...we are often forced to choose bctween individuality and community. But we can at least imagine the possibility that we can choose both alternatives, even the extremes of both. We can refuse to consider one half of the dualism better than the other half. We can refuse to make ethical choices of eith
to choose both.

Free Space: A Perspective on the Small Group in women's Liberation, by Pamela

Excerpts:

... thel period of analysis belongs after the opening up and sharing experiences, for concepts we find must answer the questions which come from our problems as women. It is not in our interest to fit experiences into a preconceived theory... Our thinking mo internalized and if we are to have the tools to look objectively at new experitools to look objectively at new
ence and analyze that correctly.

Work \& Energy As Seen in The Journals, Dreams and Fantasies of Women, by Judith Tarnenbaum, unpublished manuscript (see Directory--California).

These writings come from the experihces of a group of women who have gather ed to explore themselves and their world directly through working in journals and exploration of their dreams and fantasies.

## Excerpts :

There is a cliche about women which claims that we are more in touch with the inner world" than are men. However woman bebelieves or aisbelleves thotogy, is more cause of her given physcious, it is true that culturally we have been excluded from or given no credence for, actions in the we begin to demand equal opportunity in the world to give up as useless what w have developed in internal knowledge. Such a trade-off would be an enormous loss. The world would be a richer, healthier place, not if women accept spiritual know ledge as our lives' sole concern, but men and women both explore this inner world as well as Often the images a dream uses are very per
sonal, their meaning is specific to the individual dreamer. Other times a sumbol is universal... There are also symbols which have a cultural background. There
are images that are relevant to and under. stood by a given group of people at a given time and space. Often dream inter pretations do not keep this cultural element of dream symbology enough in mind. The way men appear in our (women's) dreams for instance, is often culturally influenc ed (we see them as protectors, teachers as threatening forces). Blackness is typicalyy interpreted) syrck as other (for us as whites). Sometimes this is true, but at other times the appearance of blacks at determined by our own cultural racism.

These are two excellent articles that discuss what can happen as men begin strugging with the shoxism; begin trying to change. We are shown how men are fear and our society's need for alienated labor. It is important that men learn to move beyond guilt and fear in response to move beyond gus of Women's Liberation. This article also shows how we can begin to develop our intuition and nurture one another. These articles are not the last word in $C-R$ for men, but it is a good point for most of us to start from. $\ldots-D_{M}$

Excerpts :

In our society we are taught to get into various behavior patterns. If a person
rejects the conditioning and acts according to his true feelings, an internal control mechanism registers guilt. Guilt is essential in keeping men cut off from feelings and locked into the social programming.

The development of intuition is based on the extension of paranoia. At first, when paranoia is empowered, it will, in fact, largely pseudo-knowledge that is in its broadest aspects incorrect, but always containing a germ of truth. As the process continues, the intuitive knowledge that will develop will be increasingly more accurate and more reliable.

An amazingly clear, well-written book that explores the violence done to women starts by looking at how myth, through fairy tales and them pornography, has shaped our perception of who women are and who they can be. Then we see how these myths have been lived out in actual cases of massive, socially sanctioned genocide
of millions of women. So we see that the destructive aspects of these roles are often more blatant than we had thought, and recognize the need to re-examine the

violence

As individuals, we experience ourselves as the center of whatever social world we inhabit. We think that we are free and refuse to see that we are functions of our culture. That culture no longer organic ally reflects us, it is not the sum total. of our creative possibilities... In order to achieve proper balance in interhuman interaction, we must find ways to change ourselves from culturally defined agents
into naturally defined beings.

The Politics of Experience, by R.D. Laing,

This book is a classic on radical

therapy and a good introduction to a new perspective on therapy and its relation to the society we live in.

$-D M$

Excerpts:

.the first ways in which the world has made sense to us continue to underpin our whole subsequent experience and actions. our first way of experiencing the world is largely what psychoanalysts have called fantasy. Fantasy as encountered in many people today is split off from what the person regards as his [sic] mature, sane, rational, adult experience. We do not then see fantasy in its true function but , sabo taging infantile nuisance.

..perception, imagination, fantasy dreams, memory, are simply different modalities of experience, none more "inner" or "outer" than any other.

.the Dreadful has already happened. It has happened to us all. [We] are in a from the outer. The inner does not become outer, and the outer become inner, just by discovery of the "inner" world. That is only the beginning. For without the inner the outer loses its meaning, and without the outer the inner loses its substance.

.any form of social revolution that ex cludes the dream in the name of rationality or efficiency, or purpose, or aim or anything, will only be digging its own grave in the long run. For dreams have an uncanny way of coming back as furious ghosts once they are repressed..

Rationalism fights the dream... mistaking it for the irrational that pervades our far less irrationd thars. Yet dreams are man [sic] consciously every man does to mapression torture, perscution earth. war, blackmail, are just some of killing, warrational things--not to mention waste greed, destruction of resources, and so many other terrible things.

If what is at stake is to change life also and not only our social systems--how can one change life without giving full expression to the dream... I mean the dream in its real freedom and potentialities of freedom for each of us. Without the dream's essential utopian activity would our life be worth a penny? I have my doubts.

historical summary of dream psychology and attempts to develop a unifying synthesis which, for me, falls short. The discussions of myths and fairy tales at the end are quite interesting, but leave me 'with mixed feelings as well. $--D M$

Excerpts

...both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves. If we do not understand the language in which they are written, we miss a great deal of what we know and tell ourselves in those hours when we are not busy manipulating the outside world.

$\ldots$ whether ignored, despised, or respected, myths are felt to belong to a world completely alien to our own thinking. Yet
the fact remains that many of our dreams are, in both style and content, similar to myths...

Sleep experience is not lacking in logic but is subject to different logical rules, which are entirely valid in that particul ar experiential state. Sleep and waking life are the two poles of human existence. waking life is taken up with the function of action, sleep is freed from it

the day wor1d is as unconscious in our sleep experience as the night world is in our waking experience. The term "uncon-
scious" is customarily used solely from the standpoint of day experience; and thus it fails to denote that both conscious and unconscious are only different states of mind referring to different states of existence.

Myths, Dreams \& Religion, Ed. by Joseph Waking Dream and Living Myth, by Ira Progoff, pp. 176-195 in the above. Excerpt:

...it is quite clear that there are often mythological aspects of dreams. When a personal experience is felt deeply enough, it touches what is more than personal in man's [sic] existence. The process of dreaming therefore moves level of myth. The creative person is one who is able to draw upon the images within himself [sic] and then to embody them in outer works.. Inward for the imagery, outward for the artworks, unified in the waking dream that of experiences brings forth a living myth. This is the nature of a myth, that it is true beyond all statements of truth.

Myth, too, is a symbolism and mythologies are likewise maps, and for this reason they, in their turn, are not to be taken literally. It is rather that when the dust falls from before our eyes, human beings are themselves the gods and demons, cting out, not the pidaling business of situations and dramas of the myths. he factual language dissects and dis integrates experience into categories and oppositions that cannot be resolved.

If the myth is not just an infantile or aberrant creation of "primitive" humanity. but is the expression of a mode of being in the world, what has become of myths in the modern world? or, more precisely, hat has taken the essential place occupi ed by the myth in traditional societies? or, if certain "participations" in myth in the modern world they are far from filling the central part played by the myth in traditional societies; in comparison with these, our modern world seef destitute of myths.

It is because they are alive, potent to revive themselves, and capable of an everrenewed, unpredictable yet self-consistent effectiveness in the range of human destiny, that the images of folklore and myth defy every attempt we make at systematization. They are not corpse-like, but implike.

There is an ancient story in the East which tells that there was a wall of mystery.

The Kin of Ata Are Waitting For You, by Dor$220 \mathrm{ppo}, 1971$

An incredibly powerful novel, beckoning to us, echoing the dream's invitation。

Weaved into the story is a very accurate picture of what life in another culture mor tuned into dreams might feel like (although it is not based on any specific group--the author didn't even know of the Senoi when riting it.) There is much we can learn for ur own dreamwork from the thes at

The main character, a materially successful writer, expresses the typically impoverished modern rational attitude toward 1ife and dreams, He suddenly finds himself transported Into another culture where the primary goal is to live for and by the dream in a simple life of work, rit-
ual and community. An intense struggie ensues, almost destroying the people and ways of Ata。 But the Kin and their dreams hold true. Indeed, the Kin are waiting for us Excerpts:

Excerpts:

By the swiftness of its actions, the imagination separates us from the past as well as from reality; it faces the future. If we cannot imagine, we cannot foresee. But to touch more simply upon the problems of the poetic imagination, it is impossible to receive the psychic benefit of poetry unless these two functions of the human psyche--the function of the real and the function of the unreal--are made to co-operate.

"What is more beautiful than a road?" George Sand wrote. "It is the symbol and the image of an active, varied life. Each one of us, then, should speak of his sic] roads, his [sic] cross-roads, his sic] roadside benches; each one of us should make a surveyor's map of his [sic] lost fields and meadows. Thoreau said hat he had the map of his fields engraved in his soul.

For the door is an entire cosmos of the Half-open. The door schematizes two strong possibilities, which sharply classify two types of daydream. At times, it is closed, bolted, padlocked. At open. If one were to give an account of all the doors one has closed and opened, of all the doors one would like to reopen, one would have to tell the story of one's entire life.

But is he [sic] who opens a door and he [sic] who closes it the same being? The gestures that make us conscious of securdepth of being.

Battle dreams are the most common and can plague ex-soldiers for years after every war. Once the trauma of war fades with wame, such dreams generally disappear. But not so examunation dreams,

[Sigmund Freud] noted a comforting aspect of the nagging nightmares: they seem to be experienced only by people who pass their exams, never by those who flunk. If Freud was right, one consolation for college students who flunk today is that they will be spared recurring dreans of

Excerpts :

the personal myths of one's dreams-the motifs and archetypes and patterns challenges and victories, jokes, tragedies and great victories--perhaps this can be a ground for the emergence of new myths. To know one's own myths.. and then to be able to share without being fucked over--perhaps this can be the root of myths for sharing--patterns of beliefs that will convey to us intangibly and more profoundly than abstract theories what sharing can mean to a new culture.

Tied closely to myth are rituals--the actions that give physical emergence to the stories and ideas and beliefs of myths Rituals are not constructed. They grow out of the deepest impulses of people sharing common ideas-from the same places that dreams and myths arise in the human psyche.

## Excerpts :

The alternative system is not a static institution, but a process of ongoing self-directed education.

The network includes the many sorts of groups that have organized to connect people directly with the learning and free clinics, free schools, underground papers and radio stations, crisis center free universities, media collectives, minority liberation groups.. "growth" centers, ecology and consumer-action groups, and so on. Each of these catagories currently includes between 200 and 800 nodes. Each node consists of ten to a hundred people, their energies lives of many others

The welter of interaction that sorts out at the moment into karass, commune, and network must be seen as.. an attemptmany attempts--at new modes of organizing human energy into groups in order to cope

In free-learning groups... people joined by common interest and mutual design... meet each other on as many of their human levels as they can, in a democratic peer society that generates its own norms and internal motivations, to leam and to create the general
knowledge needed.

How To Start a Learning Group, from a collection of articles entitled Deschooling Ourselves, by Milwaukee Free University, 911 E. Ogden, Milwaukee, WisC (write them for more information.)

Excerpts

A learning group tries to create knowledge, not just share it, by dialoguing among
each other. It avoids the teacher who ready knows the answers and the teacher
who dominates and prohibits the hidden knowledge in others from emerging.

At the first meeting.. the group should decide two things: the operation of the group, and the program format. Will one person be co-ordinator, wis, will some people present materials, and will there be readings to discuss?

Without a teacher or authority figure, the tendency may be in the other direction, and conversation trailinglete undiscipline at each meeting. People in the group will have to substitute self discipline for external authority... it means that each person should know what he [sic] wants to know before he comes to the other people.

We have in mind a new education that would set out to cultivate just such people-experts in "crap detecting." we are talk ing about the schools developing in the young that most subversive intellectual instrument- the anthropolical perspective. his [sic] own culture and at the same time, to be out of it. One views the act ivities of his [sicl own group as would an anthropologist, observing its tribal rituals, its fears, its conceits, its ethnocentrism. In this way, one is able to recognize when reality begins to drift too far away from the grasp of the tribe. Those who are sensitive to the verbally built-in biases of their "natural" environment seem "subversive" to those who are gerous because he [sic] is not easily enlisted on the side of one ideology or another, because he [sic] sees beyond the words to the processes which give an ideology its reality.

Conscious Fantasy

Working with conscious fantasy or active imagination is a good compliment to dreanwork. My experience has been with the following method used in a group: One ing everyone else to relax, close their eyes and breathe deeply. Then they relate the bare script of outline of a fan tasy, while the others picture it in their minds and watch what develops. The leader should relate the fantasy in the first person present tense, as though it is happening (it is) and develop a slow, even pace, giving everyone time to fully explore the fantasy. Finally, the fantasy time to slo an end and evergone is given time to slowly come out of it. Then we had--the variety of differences can be had--the
amazing!

This is only one type of conscious fantasy. We can also use this method to extend a aream or have conversations befantasizing can relate what is person and the leader can encourage interaction between them by guiding the fantasy in various directions. A fantasy of this

Excerpts :

with active imagination, the act of seeing with the inward eye is deliberately willed. on the other hand, what is seen is comin its operation as a dream.

It is useful.. to start with some dream image or inner situation which, so to speak, has a certain life of its own. This image or situation shoula be visualed in body but firm in mind.. The next step is to give energy over to it, so that step is to give energy over to it, so
it is free to move and develop in its own way. To do this it is necessary to colouter life, and to let that energy flow into the image. one must be actively. passive--active in giving over the energy, passive in observing. The outstanding characteristic of the true vision is its complete autonomy. You start with the image.. you give over the energy; and you see what happens.
There is a further development of active imagination... This consists in concretely depicting--drawing, painting or modellingthe inner image. In the course of the painting, details--sometimes more than details--proceed to fill themselves in thereby developing the dream images
fashion achievable in no other way.

It is possible not only to paint, but also to write from the unconscious; or still more directly, to speak with the figures constellated there. If, for instance, a personality of a definate kind appears in aream, it may later be interrogated and will answer.

None of these four methods of perception-dream analysis, active imagination, paint.ing or drawing the inner image, direct communication with the unconscious--is any thing new in the world. In one form or another they have always been the means by which prophets, seers, artists, mystics
have made contact with the unseen.

Dreams are only one form of personal access to the center and the process of forth of imaginary beings and worlds, is another way to learn about oneself and test out possible solutions to social and personal problems.

You can imagine a door and then slowly approach the door in your mind, then

Excerpt:

It is not sufficient, as in many depth psychologies, to simply bring the material of the unconscious up to the light of con

Dreams often express a profoundly spiritual dimension of our lives, whether by reflecting religious beliefs we are consciously following at the time, or spontaneously generating a spiritual experience which we can find no waking cause for. Dreams can reveal the hidden, spiritual
side of what seem to be mundane daily side of
affairs.

While many religions have been inspir ed by dreams and visions, few advocate seeking dreams as an ongoing spiritual practice. Perhaps this is because dreams
do not separate the spiritual from other aspects of our lives. While a dream may complement whatever spiritual path we are following at the time, it may also reveal that such a path is not right for us at the time, or that there are other things

Dreams: Your Magic Mirror, by Elsie

Dream interpretation theories of the American Psychic, Edgar Cayce.

Excerpts :

The importance cayce attached to the dream emphasizes its spiritual content and its moral importance to the conscious mind of the dreamer. In this spiritual sense, dreams have a universality as fundamental as breathing itself.

Through the superconscious we receive areams, visions, and experiences relating to the meaning of life, the nature of God, and the relationship between all life and God. The visions from this highest of sources always leave us refreshed mentally and spiritually. Dreams are by far the safest means of communication with all the other dimensions of consciousness but all should be measured with conmon sense and the highest of ethics.

Meditation, which is the art of listening with the subdued ego, improves the clarity of dreams, expands the consciousness, and encourages extrasensory perceptions.

To the individual who desires self-improvment and communication with his [sic] divine self, dreams will show the way. soul.

Many eastern philosophies are strongly influenced by the paradoxical, illusive nature of dreams. Most of these philos ophies lead away from the idea that dream yoga being an exception usefulness dream yoga being an exception. However
I'm still not sure dream yoga is such a positive approach, being based on the idea that "dreams are unreal, false ideas,

This country has recently been inundated with new gurus from the East and west, ophy, as well as many new therapies. Most of these make fantastic claims and in some ways this does indeed seem to be a sort of "new age" renaissance. Yet, while we can see alot of truth coming forth, there is also alot of nonsense and decoption involved. Many people have been burned or taken for a ride in the process. Others have given up responsibility for their a new, subtle form of slavery. It seems that we are in need of some
criteria for critical evaluation of these new healers. But this is tricky. The main point of most of these disciplines is that our usual way of seeing and thinking about things must be transcended. We their words from a detached position; if we are to get anything from them we have to trust, to actually get in there and try it out. Yet, there must be some way of deciding who to trust. And there should be some point in our involvement with any path that we stop and re-evaluate
our situation.

It may seem that there are only two choices we can make: either complete,
blind trust and devotion to a religion therapy/value system; or chucking it all another. Think for yourself! as nonsense. But there are many other possibilities. We can check out our intuitions--both the doubts and cersense, the helpful from the misleading. In the end it's up to each of us to decide for ourselves, to find the way that rings true in our hearts. Don't get hooked: just because there is a piece of truth doesn't mean you have to works for someone else may not be right for you and vice versa. What helps you grow at one point may hold you back at

This applies to dreams as well as anything else. I have discovered that I can trust my dreams. But that doesn't mean that I uncritically accept all the clear in this volume. them, as should be express great wisdom, but every dream must be checked out against my waking life so that it is integrated, rather than ruling my actions. Above all $I$ must remember to have patience--there are no short-cuts! Growth is a process that takes time.

The following resources reveal the beginnings of a process which I feel is long overdue. In them we see an effort to identify the destructive aspects of spir-
itual and therapeutic systems as well as the dangers they pose to our freedom. In the process we may begin to clarify what it is that we want instead, to envision truely healing and liberating processes. of course, this is only a beginning. We must each continue the process in our own way, sharing what we find with one another both enlarging and refining our vision as we go.

I am especially interested in hearing your thoughts and feelings in this arca. How would you continue this process, if at
all? what have I overlooked?

Excerpts :

In the worship of the state, life gives
mission of individual will. In the worship of the self, life also gives way to an abstraction, in this case to an exaggeration of the will. The result in both cases is the same. What is lost is the immense midale ground of human com munity. The web of reciprocity and relation is broken. The world diminishes. The felt presence of the other disappears,

..much of our present pain is the world's pain, the result of living in a catastrophic age in which we do violence to the best parts of our nature

Try as we do, we cannot ignore the routine inequities of consumption and distribution which benefit us and condern others to generalized shame, an unanswerable sense of guilt. Our therapies become a way of hiding from the world, a way of easing our troubled conscience. What lies behind the form they now take is neither shame nor realized shame of having failed the world and not knowing what to do about it.

..a very heavy price is paid for the transendental becss of conventional meditation. It involves the supression of one's independent thinking, resulting of the value system handed by the guru.

## Altered States of

Consciousness

I have not done much research or work in this area myself and do not have a great interest in doing so. However, I tensely exploring this area and have come up with vexy curious findings, speculations and further implications. I have
had several "lucid" dreams muself and know that there are many dream-events that are still a mystery. Therefore, it is import ant to keep an open mind reguarding explorations on the frontiers of dream-study.

I would caution those who have an interest in this area to take care that observing ASC's does not distract you from recognizing the need for growth and chang that a dream often points toward. This
area of study is still quite young, but would hope that an effort could be made in the near future to integrate study of these phenomenon with struggles for personal growth and meaningful social change.

Excerpt from the forward:

A dream is called "lucid", not because it has unusual visual clarity (as the adjecex is aware, at the time, that he [sicl is dreaming. Perhaps the most interesting feature of lucid dreams is that the drean er, once he [sic] has noticed that he is dxeaming, has some degree of voluntary control over the subsequent course of his dream.

Most probably it makes no difference what method is used to fly but instead what method the dreamer believes is necessary to fly as it is imagination, not physics with which we are dealing here.

It merely serves as a source of wish fulfiliment along with the more important aspect of and observation of ones own stored imressions and hallucinatory facilities.. .in the dream world as in the waking one the mind seeks the easiest answer to a "cover" up a few gaps in a story than doubt the whole setup.

Many times a dreamer might question the situation and wonder if he [sic] is dream(when he really is).

The Conscious Creation of Dream and Paranormal Experience. This book covers a wide range of inner abilities related to dreams including lucid, high, telepathic, mutual and precognitive dreams, out-of-the body experience, intentional healing and the role of conscious intent in developing intuition. Because of the relevant expe riencial research and efforts to acheive some psiychological understanding of inner abilities, this is a fascinating tour of
various "dream realities." Excerpts:

For the purposes of this book, it is assumci that genuine paranormal experience does take place and that it can be encourage? irtentionally. It is also assumer.. that the expansion of intentionality is central to self development.

The chaos that is present in ordinary
dreaming is there because there is no unifying center to give it coherent shape. Dream structure will shift to accomodate the assumptions and expectations of the dreamer. Changing these assumptions is the key to working consciously with the dream state. ..by investing dreams with a wealth of potential meaning and acting accordingly, they can become equal in usefulness and inspiration to the deepest forms of creative thought.

For all man's [sic] interest in dreams, little attention had been paid to the body of the dreamer until the early $1950^{\prime} \mathrm{s}$ when Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman demonstrated that cycles of rapid que movements and emblematic brain waves punctuated nightly sleep, and that people awakened at this time almost inevitably recalled a clear and vivid dream

The unbelievable regularity of the dream periods, so startling when Aserinsky first noticed it, gave an even more startling picture en masse. We saw that everyone normally dreams in this state every night approximately every 90 minutes for a total of about an hour and a half.

The dreams from which theories have arisen have not been dreams, of course, but memories. There is no way of checking dream reports against dreams. However embroi-
dered or shaped, however censored and skewed, we have only human recall to work with.

Excerpts (all by Richard Grossinger): Waking and dreaming are part of the same chemistry. We dream so that we can be awake. If we do not dream, then we do not awake either. Likewise, without imagination, there can be no logic, no law, no criticism..

Dreams do not counter reality. Nor does reality negate dream-event. In dream, reality is twisted, tested, tempered, reborn; subjected to the depths of its negative capability, it awakes with new energy, new clarity. Without dream we would hallucinate continuously; we could not exist upon the present body of the Earth.

There is an Amorican Indian tradition of dreams as real events, part of the total Dreams are journeys made under specific conditions. Those met in dreams are real where they are and have wisdom to offer.

We should come to dreams in peace, willing to learn, fearless of harm, for a great magic protects our very lives, kecps even our bodies from injury.

The dreaming mind, I suggest, in addition to all its other functions, is an instrument of liberation, capable of breaking up the conventional patterns of human percep. I invite you to regard the dreaming mind as a file smuggled into the space-time ce11 where man [sic] lies captive; a cell whose walls and ceiling are our five

senses, and whose warders are the inflexible concepts of logic. With the help of this always he [sicl could evade the vigilance of the Authorities--to saw through the bars of his [sic] prison and escape... But into what terrifying, what unimaginable worla? Not certainly, into a world heaven-haven. The dreaming mind leadsheaven-haven. The dreaming mind leads into a world that is fluid and ambiguo and dangerous, a phantasmal world of symbols whose meaning is at once concealed and conveyed.

In the Dream Log we have nothing but dreams. We deliberately refrain frow analyzing them. ...to intellectualize dream material by interpreting it has the ceffect of lifting it out of the depth flow
We allow them to remain on the depth leve where they can be continued from within hemselvas The seriality of dreams is the key factor ables us to draw the dream process forward. In [this] lies the great experiment and the great wonder of working with our dreams. We do not know in advance where in advance the ultimate outcome of our lives. It is always, therefore, a process of discovery. What we do know is that our dream process is moving out of the seed potential of our. life, and that the direc-

These are books that I suggest you avoid. From what I can tell, they have little redeeming value--it would probably be better to have saved the paper they two catagories. First, there are dream dictionaries, which imply that there is universal meaning for each symbol and you could interpret them like a foreign language. These books are extremely misleading; any experience with dreams will show that they simply don't work that way.

Then there are other books which are composed of trite anecdotes, non-information and mystifying attitudes about dreams These books insult the intelligence, waste our time and distract the reader from the real possibilities in exploring our dreams. This list is not exhaustive; there are many more bad books that I've simply ignor ed. Many of these titles look like they inspection proved that wrong. Your experience might be different, but for we it's thumbs down!

that all dream images are necessarily parts of yourself... a dream can be understood on many levels, and often the clear message, iseres without, with far as holding dialogues between the characters. To insist on looking for topdog/underdog conflicts in al1 dreams, even in all "inward-looking" dreams, is to push the river just as much as psychoanalysts who are dissatisfied until they have reduced a dream to sexual terms.

In our own work we try to let the dream unfold naturally, using whatever means are suitable for the situation, and certainly allowing interpretation when appropriate. Again and again, however, we encounter Gestalt therapy "topdogmatists" yapping that any attempt to look for meaning in a dream is "mind fucking," avoidance of the true emotional ssues

## The Dream Makers--by Corriere \& Hart

Here we have the biggest con job to hit the field of dreams yet. The authors seem to have a simple, basic understanding of dreams and working with them from a feeling approach. But to get to 1 you have $t$ then, anyone who is fow of nonsense, and eve ry dream exploration will find them it all been said before. I find nothing really
Obviously, they are aiming at the population that is unaware of the options. They
begin by exclaiming how revolutionary their discoveries are, how they signal the "end psychotherapy. Whey give the impression Freud. All other approaches and discover ies are either ignored, discounted or claimed dreams "clear dreams"? To suggest that they discovered them?)

With this book they've set themselves up as the new drean gurus is the only way They suggest that the dreams we've been having are no good: " normal dreams do not work." Any other approach is very dangerous "When you dabble with your dreams you are playing a very serious game of Russian roulette. Without knowing it you could blow you (sic) own head of with your dreams. In this book we will try to tell you which dreams you can eat and which ones might eat you." They claim to be touching off a "hotle grown form of therapy and development, wit no leaders and no followers," but that's on1y if you accept their dogmatic approa. sense an extremely author1tarlan and

So what's the answer? It's their new discovery called "breakthrough dreams". of course, it's the ultimate experience, like "Satori, or a good LSD trip." And you can learn to do it in only 21 days! If you don't, it's because you don't feel enough. in which case you should take their therapy sound familiar? The publisher is spending thousands on promotion and they are estab dream workshops advertised many times in the book. Perhaps the book would be better tit1ed "The Dream Money-Makers"!

They approach dreams on an emotional le ve1, which may be useful for many people who have limited themselves to an intellec tual interpretation approach. But it's tayour thoughts as seriously as your feelings." Instead of seeking a balance between intellect and emotion, our feelings become tyrants.

They claim to never interpret dreams, only to get in touch with the feelings. But the few examples of to use intellectual understanding as they do use intellectual understanding dreams do have meaning which there is no reason to ignore

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_11_8947d0c1c1ac2253f22ag-55.jpg?height=424&width=406&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=351)

They discount the value of symbolic expression in dreams, calling it indirect, ted, disorganized and inconsistent. This reveals a glaring misunderstanding of the nature of dreams. As Jung pointed out, dreams use symbolism to reveal and expres much more than they could in other ways--we only need to tune in to their mode of expression. And Calvin Hall pointed out that dreams use symbols to add extra feeling to a dream. Are symbolism and feeling the antagonistic opposites that Corriere and Hart make them out to be?

They claim their dreams change, even-tually becoming non-symbolic, which they
describe as direct, real and more feeling. But the dreams they describe contain both symbolic and non-symbolic elements, as most dreams do. They claim that people who use their approach experience a gradual change in their dreams and back their claims up with research tests. But this happens in all effective dream-work. ( have seen it in groups, it is reported by Faraday, and therapy. Dreams tend to respond to the kind of attention that is paid them.

Further criticisms of this book to be ntinued in my first newsletter.
Creative Dreaming, by Patricia Garfield Many books are published with deceptive titles these days and this one is no exception. Not only is there subtle deception here, but also some contradiction your dreams..." So right from the start we are given a heavy dose of double-think, as creative and control are used interchangably throughout the book.

But don't let this fool you; this book is advocating dream control in no uncertain terms. Yes, you too can control you dreams, just "like programing a computer or molding clay! [Her analogies] It's simple; from now on you will have no more nightmares, only go
could we ask for?

P1enty! These ideas are being present ed to a public that is basically unfamiliar with their dreams. It is suggested that we begin by learning to have control over our dreams; that we change them bespect them as they are. This seem very dangerous and premature to me, as it does to many others

The author does anticipate that there may be some objections to this approach, but they are easily dismissed. "The person who does not accept creative dreaming dreams will simply not attempt is. person who is not ready for it will the obtain the desired responses, it cannot hurt to try." Perhaps many people would close the book right here, but she goes further to discount any feelings of distrust, "It is difficult to know what our dreams would be like in a 'pure, untampered' state. To a large extent, our dreams are right now what we make them. They are already tampered with. Now dreamers can either formulate intended dreams for themselves or have dream images imposed on them from an outside
source. Most people's dreams are unsource. Most people's dreams are unawarediy shaped by
that surround them
This last statement could lead us in many directions, but her on1y concern is to make one point: that we have no real don't worry about what is natural, such things do not exist. One may not like it, but we must drop our illusions and face up to the realities of modern life (which she then describes.)

It just so happens that I strongly disagree with her description of the situadetermined by cultural conditioning and they offer a uniquely effective tool for breaking out of the cultural trance. There are many choices that can be made and I choose not to control, mold, or manipulate my dreams!

But, if we were interested in contro1ling our dreams, how would we do it? The ther cultures suggests that they may have some suggestions. Yet, a closer look will show that these customs have been misinterpreted and the major suggestions come from c1oser to home. Self-hypnosis, behavior modification, and the power-ofpositive-thinking approaches are the basis of her system. "While in a relaxed, drowsy state, repeat to yourself your intended dream phrase several times. Once you have clearly formu1ated your desired pattern internal responces begin. Best results may be obtained by repetition of
the message."

I don't condemn all uses of hypnotism. rt may even have a useful role to play in working with dreams. But it seems to be relied on too heavily in this approach. And while some people may be bothered by the repetition and hard-sell style of writing in this book, the style is con example of what is called "pushing the river," as is most behavior modification.

This concept is central to dream control. If you change your behavior in your to produce a change in your waking life attitudes, then your waking behavior will change, too. It is similar to the effect of modern behavior therapy applied in a waking state.

While behavior modification may be very popular in some circles, it also ffers a dangerous form of social control Unfortunately, it can work, human beings fituations, no matter how unpleasant or self-destructive they may be, Apparently we can even get ourselves to stop having nightmares. But wouldn't it be better if we could see what the nightmare was referring to? If a nightmare points out an inner conflict or an oppressive social ituation, does banishing the nightmare really resolve the conflict of merely repress our awareness of it?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_11_8947d0c1c1ac2253f22ag-55.jpg?height=443&width=460&top_left_y=752&top_left_x=2717)

Ms. Garfield repeats the message several at our But is this really the origin of all our problems? If we can change our behavior problems? If we can change our behavior the roots of the problems or merely manipulating the surface symptoms? Changing our dreans will not simply "carry over" into our waking lives. It takes real struggle to change our lives and the world around us, but that effort makes a real lasting difference.

Along with the hard-sell tone of this book come many big promises. "Anything becomes possibie. You can create a better self. You may not dream and grow ric (although even this is possible).." Sometrivial, uncreative and useless next to these possibilities.

But the big prize is more orgasms! Sexual interaction is a catagory that can be easily and precisely measured in the Senoi system: Did the dreamer experience orgasm or not? No problem with sexual symbolism... increasing or gasms in dreams well carry over positive attitudes waking life." Apparently attitudes to has special significance for women, dreams of ang sexual expression in the value in developing feelings of selfesteem, capability, and other traits of independence." Is this an answer to the women's movement? The implications of
this are extended in an article called this are extended in an article called Dream Control which appeared

The best thing this book has to offer are the accounts of attitudes, practices and experiences with dreams from other times and cultures. There is alot we can
learn from this information, but we must be cautious to avoid putting our own material has been them. I feel this her great rush to translate forted by tices into our use. This is most obvious when she looks
at Native Americans. She confuses a great respect for dreams and spiritual discip1ine (proper fasting is not self-torture) with self-degradation and pity. She then deciding the Senoi have a better attitude and we should follow their example. She also suggests that these cultures use behavior modification.

The transition is quick, too quick, so the one hardly sees the slight-ot-hand a the experiences of another culture are ti.on by our modern society. And what kind of society i.s this? "We are a society that requires assertiveness and independence for success. Ours is not a cooperative, compliant culture. You may actually
be able to develop your own independence by appropriate uses of your dreams."
The entire thrust of this book is contrary to my approach to dreams. I advocate using dreams for se1f-knowledge and together for meaningful growth and change in ourselves and the wor1d around us. To me the power to change our behavior in our dreams and wait around for this to produce some changes in our waking behavior, seems pale in comparison. Others may see things different $1 y$. If so, read Creative Dream-
ing, but keep these criticisms in mind and know that there are other alternatives.

## Who Is C1ara Stewart Flagg?

Clara Stewart Flagg has recently run dream workshops at numerous growth centers around the country. She is the widow of Dr. Kilton Stewart (who did much of the pioneer study of and excellent writing on the Senoi and their use of dreams.) She arries on his work as a Dream Educator Senoi soon

Many people have written me expressing strong criticisms of her methods of working with dreams. Apparently her approach central criticism being that she encourages people to control their dreams with out adequate self-knowledge.

But it seems she has gone farther to develop a ridgid set of interpretations from which she criticizes people's dreams and then directs them on how to act difappears in next time a similar situation from anyone (yet) who feels i have not heard with her methods. who feels comfortable
I have also been told that she seems overly-protective of Kilton Stewart's work, preferring that no-one mention his work
without her permission or apply Senoi without her permission or apply Senoi
methods without having studied directly under her. Many people have had a hard time dealing with her and say she does not

I must say, I have never attended one of her workshops myself and I am mainly reflecting criticisms that I have heard from many others whose experience with dreams of a workshop she gave which was sub-titl ed, "If you can't eat it or fuck it, piss on it. This has confirmed all other critticisms I have heard.) If you have the opportunity (without. it costing you too know what your experience is like. I would a1so welcome a responce to these criticisms from Mrs. Flagg herself.

Dream Contro1, by Nancy Weber--Criticism: It's hard to avoid commenting on the context this article appears in, the magicle with the young maiden supposedly in her beauty-slumber. Do people really
fall for this stuff? It is an effort, but I will get on to the actual article.

The approach is basically the one described in Creative Dreaming, but it is also the story of attending a "dream manipulation workshop." The author apparent1y has some doubts at first, "I found myself disappointed in what I felt was an overly rigid and facile interpretation
symbols on the leader's part, but I was carried away by the excitement of the group regulars who told how they had dreams or had been able to redream the dreams or had been able to redream them symbol structure." Well, she may have seen "carried away", but I'm not. I suggest avoiding any approach to dreams ability to manipulate my dreams and bring them in line with such a system sounds downright horrifying!
At the start of this artic1e is an example of a woman's nightmare that she is going to be raped. The suggestion given is that with dream control she can learn to confront and out-smart her attackers, turning it into a positive friend of to so for dreaming of rape is fy experience is that dreaming of rape is fairly common for many dreams, but they do not seem to show theame women have an unreal "paranoid" fear Rather, they are an expression of the very real danger of rape, which is fairly high in our society. These nightmares are
pointing to a nightmare situation that must be changed.

Rape is a big problem, one whose roots run deep within the contradictions and
sickness of this society. Consequently, sickness of this society. Consequently, ing changes, not just suggesting women manipulate their dreams so they no manipulate thetr dreams so they no longer
dream about it. This suggests that it is just their problem and if they could forget about it everything would be fine. A solution such as this may be in harmony with the philosophy of Playgir1, but to me it seems clearly wrong and dangerous.

The article also announces a patent dismissal of other dream theories. "You ing your dreams. There have been any ing you dreams. 伍 the shaping of dreams.. Contemporary laboratory research has 1ed to dismissal of oratory research has theories.." This is simply not true. There is still alot unexplained.

But there is also alot of knowledge about dreams which suggests we might enjoy and than starting right off manipulating and than starting rige

Finally, we are given a fantasy of the Dream Control future, "Dial-A-Dream! Much as one sits down with a guide to program an evening's entertainment..." My
dreams are insulted. Need I say more?

flooded with requests for dream interpret flooded with requests for dream interpret

Secondly, I collect the narrative "tales" which emanate from my dreams; which I then use in writing and in mixed media. I'm currently finishing up on "Venice/Venice",
a series of dreams on Venice. The book is

I believe many dreams press us to utilize them in resolving confusions of everyday ife, to clarily personal and political \$ \qquad \$
I work from a primarily Gestalt base. Many dreams contain strong symbolic ele thers are interrupted fritasy thers are interrupted at frightening tive action-solutions Still others revolve around familiar, "universal", images and concerns. I always try to involve the group at one level or another. Participants often report that their take-offs from another dreamer's material have been as enriching for them as their own.
Emphasis is on the dreamer (as we11 as the group) re-experiencing the dream the dream and fantasy material with life process (rather than analyzing or solving the dream).

Throughout history dreams have served humankind as a wel1-spring of discovery, invention, and healing. In utilizing dreams paradox and metaphor in counseling, I have synthesized the rituals of the Ple-Temiar Senoi tribe of Ma1aysia, and other shamanis tic traditions, with what I experience to b some of the most effective c1inical methods of our own culture.
I base this process on two assumptions. First, we do not have to suffer to grow. Second, (from a contemporary Archmagus named Milton H, Erickson), there is no such thing as resistance to therapy. These assumptions are deve1oped in the context of dream play by using positive paradoxical communication as an alternative to tonfrontation". Dreams are a manifestathe our style-of-being-in-the world.

## (o) Where The Money Goes

When you buy a book, have you ever wondered where your money is going? what portion of it goes to the author and what part to paper costs, printers, publishers,
distributors, advertising, bookstores and so on? what portion of your money goes to much to pay for real work done and how much to excessive profits for a few want to raise these questions the line? I they are important to me and here because a crucial part in the process of creating this book.

A major question that arose during this project was how the book would be published, At first I considered going to when ot pubrisher. But I began to wonder when other authors complained of having
little control over their work and it's presentation to the public once a big publisher had it. Through my work in bookstores and libraries, I learned that a few large companies and multi-national publishing industry and are part of the primarily for their are in business seriously limits and distorts what can appear in print. Since this is a situaEion that I do not want to be used by or in any way support, I have decided to bypass publishers.

Initially, this means much more work for me, as I must do all the editing,
typing, correcting and layout myself; then deal directly with the printer. But having greater freedom of design and This decision a1so creates greater personal risk and some tough distribution problems. I'm trying to solve these problems as I go and would great1y welcome the readers' heip

Another question that came up was how I would price the book. I wanted to set a reasonable price so that many people would have access to the information, yet had to be careful not to set the price
too low and lose money. I decided to estimate the real costs such as printing, supplies, a fair payment for my work, advertising, bookstores' percentages,
etc. and set the price accordingly. Further, I decided to print up this infor mation, so that the reader could understand where their money was going. Without such efforts at accountability it is price is really fair public to tell if how any specific figure was arrived at.

From the start this project has been entirely non-profit. i define profit as (including a fair payment for work costs It seems to me that efforts to maximize. such profits by publishers and (to a lesser extent) booksellers and authors are
inevitably at the publics' expense. I feel best when working for people, not for
personal profit.

## Ever Considered Se1f-Publishing?

Self-publishing is becoming an attractive option for more $\&$ more people. You need relatively little money to get started. You are in control of your own work. It does require hard work, but the skills needed are we are developing. As more people do it, - support systems, If you are considering such a project,

There are several changes to note: The cost of printing a second run with a larger planning on wider distribution and increased bookstore sales, so I've set aside a larger percentage for that. For both printings had to get loans for the initial printing costs. (Thanks again to those able to help

to exp1ore and learn from our dreams.
This will require a continual sharing of results, refining and expanding our me thods and knowledge unti1 we are fully at home in our dreamworld and the dreams become a healing force in our waking lives There is so much more that could be done,

As you try out any of the suggestions included, let me know what works for you, what results you get, any it differently. With feedback from many people, methods of dreamwork can be developed that are effective and appropriate for a wide variety of people. To update this edition of the book, I re-did the entire directory section, added many titles to the bibliography, I plan on compiling an index for the book and the first newsletter (Both of them will be available for $\$ 1.00$.)

For the first newsletter I'd like to include reader's comments, reviews of new books, new directory listings, material work and more I'd also like to put together another essay on organtizing and running ongoing dream workshops; this time with more input from others dofng For this, I'd 11 ke to know of al1 dream groups now going or being organized. I'd like to know how you find people, what commitments are made, what fees asked
ariy), and any specific group process pointers that I might not have mentione out in the group.
I'd 1ike to get coples of posters used to announce the workshops or mater1al handed

Eventually, this entire book should be revised, expanded and up-dated. I welcome your input: comments and criticisms of material in this book, new perspectives, additional book reviews, quotes, graphics, personal visions and questions about the dream world. It would be a big project, which I could see doing maybe 3-5 years from nowo For now perhaps newsletters r smal. booklets may be the best format until the energy exists to completely evise this book.

I'd like to find others to share this work or de-centralize it as much as possible. This means I also encourage people to send material to Sundance Community Dream Journal (see p. 29) and newsletters others are starting (see directory.) If you have a great deal of experience interest in a spectic area, perhaps evaluate and work on--then printed here or elsewhere

## Late Directory 1isting:

 R.R. \#2, Box 697 , Kerhonkson, N.Y. 12446We have been celebrating dream ceremonie on our farm in the Catskil1s. The farm is becoming a center for the exploration and enactment of dreams we work primarily in sleeping together in a tipi, sharing their dreams and enacting them through mask making, painting, dancing and drumuing
Choosing a project for yourself or your dream-group is a good way of creating new knowledge and writing it up enables you to share it with others. Many pro
could be initiated that have not been included in the scope of this book. Since I have been primarily focusing on the howto aspects of dream-work, compiling a bibliography and directory, I have not included many actual dreams or dreaminspired material. Examples of actual dreams and what can be done with them would be an excellent project for another ol.ume

There are many ways this could be done. You could try creating clear, moving expressions of a single dreare, dream image or event through writing, drawing the image, physically acting it out or recording any inner dialogue or fantasies that develop. Which dreams deliver
forceful statements all by themselves

You could write up a dream with a brief description of the process of working on it, what was learned from it and how this was followed througin.

One could study or work with a series of dreams. Perhaps you can already identify a series developing in your own dreams. What does it revolve around, how does it change?

How about making a collection of dreams which revolve around a certain image, topic, or event from many people? A collection of dreams with animals or which you can identify authority figures or sex role stereotypes. What about flying
dreams, or violence in dreams? Drean col.lections such as these could te made fro specific groups of people--children, prisoners, students, your close friends, could be people, farmers, etc. What

Use a dream, drean image, or series of dreams as the besic material or inspir-
ation to write a story or article from. Try to maintain a dynamic balance between the dreans' energy and your waking creativity, so that the final result is a synthesis between the two.

What wou1d you 1ike to do? How cou1d you he $1_{p}$ explore the dream world or extend work others have done? What questions would you like to see others investigate?

In order to keep in touch with any further work that develops out of this project, just write and I will put you on my matling list. A few stamps or some

## What The Reviewers Are Saying:

This superb little book is a sign of the times both in its contents and in its mode of publication. Interest in dreams has been bustin out all over during the current decade, and here at last is a whole Earth Catalogue" of resources available in the field...

Time was when se1f-publication was regarded, rather like dreams, as an indulgence for folk whose narcissism exceeded their talent for producing viable work, but not any more... Welcome to the Magic Theater demonstrates that a very thorough, scholarly book can be attractively produced, with many delightful illustrations, on a shoestring budget..

Until I read this book I would not have thought it possible to produce a bibliography and resource-catalogue which would make entertaining reading in its own right, but Mcleester has done just that. At a time when a11 kinds of hucksters are climbing on the dream bandwagon for their own personal advantage, it is good to have a resourcebook that is a rea1 labor of love, and can be trusted.

- John Wren-Lewis in New Age Journal

D)ick has found so much value in pursuing his own night musings that he's prepared one of the best introductions to the sleepy third of your life that we've fver seen. He seems to have covered everything from the familiar work of Jung and the Senoi tribesmen of Malaysia to experiments with dream telepathy and incubation, with dozens o delightful side trips into the methods of the American Indians, the dgar Cayce Foundation, feminist and other political groups, and ancient systems from the tarot and the Taoist traditions.

--The Village Voice

With great respect for and sensitivity to the dream, McLeester emphasizes humor, playfulness, a deep sense of community, and freedom from ideolog.

Our dreams are a true, living mirror; a magic looking glass whose reflection can penetrate to the core of our lives. Our dreams cannot lie, although they can be misunderstood. In order to fully experience the truth our dreams express it is important that we suspend our preconceptions and openly step into the dream-space. From there we look back to see our life and our world from the perspective of the dream. The better we get at doing this, the closer we will come to learning from the dream on its own terms.

## Dream Bibliography:

An extensive bibliography of material that relates to dreams is included. The list of over 300 titles includes many short reviews and excerpts so that you can get some idea of the actual contents. All are viewed with a critical eye, so you can sort the useful information from that which is misleading or trivial.

The bibliography includes sections on Psychology (featuring Jungian and Gestalt approaches), Dreams In Other Cultures (featuring The American Indian Vision Quest \& The Senoi of Malaya), Consciousness-Raising and Scoial Change, Myths \& Fairy Tales, Creativity, Novels \& Poetry, Learning, Conscious Fantasy, Spiritual, On Spiritual and Therapeutic Tyranny, Altered States of Consciousness, Biology \& Physiology, and more.

All vital information on cost and accessibility is included: some titles may be ordered by mail directly from us.

## Dream Directory:

The final section is a directory of other people around the world who are working with dreams in various ways. These listings show the wide range of work actually being done and enable those interested to directly contact each other.

It is hoped that this will be the beginning of a network of sharing and support among those working with dreams. This directory will be periodically updated and expanded, so we would like to hear from anyone who would like to share what they are doing, what your interests or questions are regarding dreams.

In order to have greater freedom of design and control over my work, I have published it myself. This means I do not have a big advertising budget or well-developed distribution network. You can help by mentioning the book to your friends and suggesting your favorite bookstore and local library to order it. Let us know of any publication interested in doing a review or a small ad for us. Any support or constructive criticism you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

This project is entirely non-profit, which means that all money is going toward meeting basic expenses. An explanation of where your money goes is included in the book.

Growing up in this culture, many of us have learned to ignore, fear and forget our dreams. Every morning we shake them off as so much useless nonsense. Or we have them analyzed, torn apart and returned as an "interpretation"--a poor substitute for the mystery and dynamic energy of the dream.

Our dreams have so much more to offer. In

this book I point out some other options, a wide range of ways you can explore your dreams. Decide for yourself which way is best for you. Learn to respect your dreams and become familiar with your dreamworld. Your dreams could become an integrated, healing part of your life again, if given the chance.

Every night the door to The Magic Theater opens again. The invitation reads: "Enjoy!"
